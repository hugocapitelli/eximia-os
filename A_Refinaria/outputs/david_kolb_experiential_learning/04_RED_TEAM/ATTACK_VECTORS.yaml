# CATEGORIA 1: PSICOMETRIA E METODOLOGIA

vectors:
  - id: "AV-01"
    name: "LSI Reliability Crisis"
    category: "Psychometric"
    target: "Learning Style Inventory (LSI)"
    severity: "High"

    premise_attacked: "LSI is a valid instrument for measuring learning styles"

    attack:
      summary: "Multiple studies show poor test-retest reliability"
      evidence:
        - source: "Freedman & Stumpf (1980)"
          finding: "LSI showed inconsistent factor structure"
        - source: "Coffield et al. (2004)"
          finding: "Classified LSI as having 'low reliability and validity'"
        - source: "Kayes (2005)"
          finding: "Factor analysis did not support four-style model"

    counter_argument: |
      If the instrument measuring learning styles has poor reliability,
      how can we trust conclusions about the existence and nature of
      those styles?

    kolb_defense: "LSI 4.0 addressed many of these concerns; instrument is for reflection, not diagnosis"

    rebuttal: "Even LSI 4.0 lacks independent validation; 'reflection tool' framing is unfalsifiable"

  - id: "AV-02"
    name: "Matching Hypothesis Failure"
    category: "Empirical"
    target: "Pedagogical recommendations"
    severity: "Critical"

    premise_attacked: "Matching teaching style to learning style improves outcomes"

    attack:
      summary: "No rigorous evidence supports the matching hypothesis"
      evidence:
        - source: "Pashler et al. (2008)"
          finding: "No support for matching in controlled studies"
        - source: "Willingham (2015)"
          finding: "American Educator review found no valid evidence"
        - source: "Rogowsky et al. (2015)"
          finding: "No interaction between style and instruction mode"

    counter_argument: |
      If matching doesn't improve learning, what is the practical
      value of knowing one's "learning style"?

    kolb_defense: "Flexibility is the goal, not matching"

    rebuttal: "If flexibility is the goal, why develop a categorization instrument at all?"

  - id: "AV-03"
    name: "Cycle Sequence Untested"
    category: "Methodological"
    target: "Experiential Learning Cycle"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "Learning follows the EC→OR→CA→EA sequence"

    attack:
      summary: "No empirical studies tracking actual cognitive sequence"
      evidence:
        - source: "Jarvis (2004)"
          finding: "Proposed more complex, non-linear model"
        - source: "Fenwick (2000)"
          finding: "Five alternative perspectives on experiential learning"

    counter_argument: |
      The cycle is asserted, not demonstrated. Where is the cognitive
      science evidence of this sequence occurring in learners' minds?

    kolb_defense: "The cycle is a heuristic, not a literal description"

    rebuttal: "Heuristics should still be validated for practical usefulness"

# CATEGORIA 2: FUNDAMENTOS FILOSOFICOS

  - id: "AV-04"
    name: "Dewey Misreading"
    category: "Philosophical"
    target: "Theoretical foundations"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "ELT is faithful to Dewey's concept of experience"

    attack:
      summary: "Kolb's 'concrete experience' is narrower than Dewey intended"
      evidence:
        - source: "Miettinen (2000)"
          finding: "Kolb divorces experience from Dewey's social context"
        - source: "Beckett & Hager (2002)"
          finding: "Dewey's experience was transactional, not individualist"

    counter_argument: |
      Dewey's "experience" included cognitive and social dimensions,
      not just sensory immersion. Kolb's "concrete experience" is a
      reduction, not a faithful reading.

    kolb_defense: "Synthesis, not exact replication, was the goal"

    rebuttal: "Misattribution undermines theoretical credibility"

  - id: "AV-05"
    name: "Piaget Analogy Stretch"
    category: "Philosophical"
    target: "Developmental claims"
    severity: "Low"

    premise_attacked: "ELT extends Piaget's developmental stages"

    attack:
      summary: "Piaget described sequential stages, not concurrent styles"
      evidence:
        - source: "Piaget (1970)"
          finding: "Stages are sequential and universal, not preference-based"

    counter_argument: |
      Using Piaget's stage theory to justify simultaneous "styles"
      conflates development with preference. These are different constructs.

  - id: "AV-06"
    name: "Lewin Extrapolation"
    category: "Philosophical"
    target: "T-Group foundation"
    severity: "Low"

    premise_attacked: "T-Groups validate individual learning cycle"

    attack:
      summary: "Lewin focused on group dynamics, not individual cognition"
      evidence:
        - source: "Lewin (1946)"
          finding: "Action research was about social change, not learning styles"

    counter_argument: |
      T-Groups were designed for group development and social psychology,
      not for validating individual learning preferences.

# CATEGORIA 3: EVIDENCIA EMPIRICA

  - id: "AV-07"
    name: "Publication Bias"
    category: "Empirical"
    target: "Research base"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "50 years of research supports ELT"

    attack:
      summary: "Positive studies published; null results underreported"
      evidence:
        - source: "General publication bias literature"
          finding: "Null results are rarely published in education research"

    counter_argument: |
      Citing "50 years of research" without systematic review of
      null and negative findings creates survivorship bias.

  - id: "AV-08"
    name: "WEIRD Sample Bias"
    category: "Empirical"
    target: "Generalizability"
    severity: "High"

    premise_attacked: "ELT describes universal human learning"

    attack:
      summary: "Most research on Western, Educated, Industrialized samples"
      evidence:
        - source: "Henrich et al. (2010)"
          finding: "Psychology findings often don't replicate cross-culturally"
        - source: "Joy & Kolb (2009)"
          finding: "Regional variations exist but interpretation contested"

    counter_argument: |
      Claiming universality from predominantly American/European
      samples is scientifically unjustified.

  - id: "AV-09"
    name: "Self-Report Validity"
    category: "Methodological"
    target: "LSI methodology"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "People accurately report their learning preferences"

    attack:
      summary: "Self-reports are vulnerable to social desirability and poor metacognition"
      evidence:
        - source: "Nisbett & Wilson (1977)"
          finding: "People have limited access to cognitive processes"

    counter_argument: |
      If people cannot accurately introspect their learning processes,
      self-report instruments measure perceived, not actual, styles.

# CATEGORIA 4: CRITICAS PRATICAS

  - id: "AV-10"
    name: "Implementation Cost"
    category: "Practical"
    target: "Educational reform proposals"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "Education should move to experiential model"

    attack:
      summary: "Experiential learning at scale is resource-intensive"
      evidence:
        - source: "Cost analysis"
          finding: "Labs, simulations, field work cost more than lectures"

    counter_argument: |
      Advocating experiential education without addressing resource
      constraints ignores implementation reality for most institutions.

  - id: "AV-11"
    name: "Elite Bias"
    category: "Practical"
    target: "Implicit assumptions"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "All learners benefit from experiential approach"

    attack:
      summary: "Kolb developed theory at elite institutions (MIT, Harvard, Case Western)"
      evidence:
        - source: "Biographical data"
          finding: "Career entirely in well-resourced academic environments"

    counter_argument: |
      Theory developed with privileged populations may not transfer
      to under-resourced contexts where "concrete experiences" are limited.

  - id: "AV-12"
    name: "Time Inefficiency"
    category: "Practical"
    target: "Full cycle completion"
    severity: "Low"

    premise_attacked: "The full cycle should be completed for deep learning"

    attack:
      summary: "Completing four stages takes longer than direct instruction"
      evidence:
        - source: "Sweller (1988)"
          finding: "Cognitive load theory suggests direct instruction more efficient for novices"

    counter_argument: |
      For time-constrained learning, is full-cycle experiential learning
      more efficient than well-designed direct instruction?

# CATEGORIA 5: ALTERNATIVAS TEORICAS

  - id: "AV-13"
    name: "Cognitive Load Superiority"
    category: "Alternative Theory"
    target: "ELT overall"
    severity: "High"

    premise_attacked: "ELT is the best framework for understanding learning"

    alternative_theory:
      name: "Cognitive Load Theory"
      author: "John Sweller"
      advantage: "Empirically validated, specific mechanisms, testable predictions"

    counter_argument: |
      Cognitive Load Theory has stronger empirical base and makes
      more specific, testable predictions about learning.

  - id: "AV-14"
    name: "Deliberate Practice Specificity"
    category: "Alternative Theory"
    target: "Learning style preferences"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "Learning preferences matter for skill development"

    alternative_theory:
      name: "Deliberate Practice"
      author: "K. Anders Ericsson"
      advantage: "Domain-specific, measurable, progression-focused"

    counter_argument: |
      Deliberate practice research suggests domain matters more than
      learner preference for expert performance development.

  - id: "AV-15"
    name: "Situated Learning Context"
    category: "Alternative Theory"
    target: "Individual focus of ELT"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "Learning is primarily an individual process"

    alternative_theory:
      name: "Situated Learning"
      author: "Lave & Wenger"
      advantage: "Explains social dimension ELT underemphasizes"

    counter_argument: |
      Learning is fundamentally social and contextual. ELT's
      individual focus misses the community of practice dimension.

# CATEGORIA 6: LOGICA INTERNA

  - id: "AV-16"
    name: "Flexibility Paradox"
    category: "Logical"
    target: "Core constructs"
    severity: "High"

    premise_attacked: "Styles are real but flexibility is the goal"

    attack:
      summary: "Tension between categorical instrument and flexibility ideal"

    counter_argument: |
      If the goal is flexibility and styles vary by context, what
      does the LSI actually measure? This is internally contradictory.

  - id: "AV-17"
    name: "Tautology Risk"
    category: "Logical"
    target: "Theory structure"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "Experiential learning is the source of learning"

    attack:
      summary: "Defining learning as coming from experience is near-tautological"

    counter_argument: |
      "Learning comes from experience" is almost definitionally true,
      making it unfalsifiable and scientifically weak.

  - id: "AV-18"
    name: "Falsifiability Deficit"
    category: "Logical"
    target: "Theory as whole"
    severity: "High"

    premise_attacked: "ELT is a scientific theory"

    attack:
      summary: "What would falsify ELT? If nothing, it's not scientific"

    counter_argument: |
      Kolb presents ELT as "comprehensive theory" but it's difficult
      to imagine what evidence would disprove it. This violates
      Popper's falsifiability criterion.

# CATEGORIA 7: COMERCIALIZACAO

  - id: "AV-19"
    name: "Commercial Interests"
    category: "Conflict of Interest"
    target: "LSI instrument"
    severity: "Medium"

    premise_attacked: "LSI recommendations are purely scientific"

    attack:
      summary: "EBLS sells LSI; financial interest in continued use"
      evidence:
        - source: "Experience Based Learning Systems website"
          finding: "LSI is commercial product with licensing fees"

    counter_argument: |
      When the theory creator profits from the assessment instrument,
      there's inherent conflict of interest in evaluating criticism.

  - id: "AV-20"
    name: "Consulting Industry"
    category: "Conflict of Interest"
    target: "Popularity of learning styles"
    severity: "Low"

    premise_attacked: "Learning styles persist because they're true"

    attack:
      summary: "Large consulting industry depends on learning style concepts"

    counter_argument: |
      Learning styles may persist not because of evidence but because
      of the ecosystem of consultants, trainers, and products built around them.
