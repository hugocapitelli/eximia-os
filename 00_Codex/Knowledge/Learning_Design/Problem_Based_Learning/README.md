# Problem-Based Learning (PBL) - Knowledge Base

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-23
**Curated By:** The_Veritas
**Quality Assurance:** The_Maestro
**Status:** Production Ready

---

## Overview

This Knowledge Base consolidates comprehensive research on **Problem-Based Learning (PBL)**, a student-centered instructional methodology where learning occurs through facilitated problem-solving of complex, real-world problems.

**Core Definition:**
> PBL is an instructional method in which students learn through facilitated problem solving, with student learning centered on a complex problem that does not have a single correct answer.

## Quick Reference

### Key Authors
- **Howard S. Barrows** (1928-2011) - Father of PBL
- **Cindy E. Hmelo-Silver** - Contemporary research leader
- **Schmidt, Yew, Hung** - Cognitive constructivist process

### Essential Reading (Start Here)
1. Barrows & Tamblyn (1980) - *Problem-Based Learning: An Approach to Medical Education*
2. Hmelo-Silver (2004) - *Problem-Based Learning: What and How Do Students Learn?*
3. Recent meta-analysis (2024) - *Second-order meta-analysis in higher education*

### Key Statistics
- **800% growth** in PBL publications (2014-2024)
- **ES = 0.60** - Mean effect size (significant high impact)
- **5 Core Goals:** Flexible knowledge, problem-solving, SDL, collaboration, intrinsic motivation

## Confidence & Quality

**Confidence Score:** 90% (Very High)
- 10+ Tier 1 academic sources (peer-reviewed)
- Triangulation across multiple disciplines
- Meta-analyses with large samples
- Direct access to foundational texts

**Limitations:**
- English-language bias (limited Portuguese/other languages)
- Heavy medical education focus (PBL origin)
- Limited AI-enhanced PBL coverage (emerging area)

---

## Next Steps

### Recommended Actions
1. **Read:** Start with KB_01_Foundations.md for conceptual grounding
2. **Process:** Use Intellex to extract additional frameworks from sources
3. **Expand:** Add non-English sources, discipline-specific models
4. **Apply:** Use in LXD_Architect agent for course design

### Research Gaps to Fill
- [ ] Portuguese-language PBL research (Brazil, Portugal)
- [ ] Engineering/business PBL models (beyond medical)
- [ ] AI-enhanced PBL tools and platforms
- [ ] Validated assessment rubrics and instruments
- [ ] Neuroscience evidence supporting PBL
