## Assessment Tools & Rubrics

### Process Assessment

**Collaboration Rubric Dimensions:**
- Participation (quantity and quality)
- Listening (building on others' ideas)
- Contribution (bringing resources, ideas)
- Responsibility (completing assigned tasks)

**Self-Directed Learning Rubric:**
- Learning issue formulation (specific, researchable)
- Resource quality (credible, appropriate)
- Depth of understanding (can explain, not just repeat)
- Connection to problem (applies findings)

---

### Product Assessment

**Solution Quality Rubric:**
- Completeness (addresses all aspects of problem)
- Evidence-based (uses research to justify)
- Feasibility (realistic constraints)
- Communication (clear presentation)

**Knowledge Application Rubric:**
- Accuracy (correct information)
- Transfer (applies to new context)
- Integration (connects multiple concepts)
- Justification (explains reasoning)

---

### Peer Assessment Tools

**Peer Evaluation Form:**
```
Rate each team member (1-5) on:
1. Contributed ideas and resources
2. Listened respectfully to others
3. Completed assigned tasks on time
4. Helped the team stay focused

Provide specific example of this person's contribution:
[Text field]

One thing this person could improve:
[Text field]
```

**Self-Assessment Prompts:**
- My most valuable contribution was...
- I struggled with...
- Next time I would...
- I learned that...

## Common Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: "I don't have time to cover content AND do PBL"

**Solutions:**
- **Hybrid model:** Some PBL, some lecture (80/20 or 60/40)
- **Curricular prioritization:** What's essential vs. nice-to-know?
- **Trust the process:** PBL often covers MORE when students self-direct
- **Long-term view:** Retention from PBL reduces review time

---

### Challenge 2: "Students complain they're not being taught"

**Solutions:**
- **Explain PBL rationale:** Share research on effectiveness
- **Gradual introduction:** Start small (one PBL), increase over time
- **Visible facilitation:** Students may not recognize teaching when it's questioning
- **Patience:** Initial discomfort is normal, improves after 2-3 PBLs

---

### Challenge 3: "Administration/parents don't support PBL"

**Solutions:**
- **Invite observation:** Show (don't tell) PBL in action
- **Share student work:** Showcase depth of learning
- **Present research:** Meta-analyses, effect sizes
- **Start voluntary:** Pilot with willing teachers, expand based on success

---

### Challenge 4: "I'm uncomfortable not being the expert"

**Solutions:**
- **Reframe role:** You're coaching experts-in-training
- **It's okay to not know:** Model SDL when you don't know answer
- **Focus on process:** Teach HOW to learn, not just WHAT to learn
- **Trust students:** They'll surprise you with their capability

---

### Challenge 5: "Grading group work is unfair"

**Solutions:**
- **Individual accountability:** Peer assessment, individual quizzes
- **Process grades:** Assess SDL work, reflection (individual)
- **Multiple data points:** Don't rely solely on group product
- **Transparent rubrics:** Students know expectations upfront
