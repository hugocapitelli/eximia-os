## 🎯 Core Frameworks (Tier 1 - Foundational)

### Framework 1: The Barrows-Tamblyn PBL Model (1980)

**Origin:** McMaster University Medical School
**Creators:** Howard S. Barrows & Robyn M. Tamblyn
**Domain:** Medical Education → All Disciplines

**Core Principle:** **Problem BEFORE Instruction**

#### Traditional Sequence:
```
Lecture → Theory → Memorization → (Maybe) Application
```

#### Barrows PBL Sequence:
```
Problem → Inquiry → Self-Directed Learning → Application → Reflection
```

**Two Fundamental Postulates:**

1. **Postulate 1: Flexible Knowledge > Inert Knowledge**
   - Learning through problem-solving creates more usable knowledge than memorization
   - Knowledge integrated with context is more transferable

2. **Postulate 2: Active Construction > Passive Reception**
   - Students construct knowledge actively through problem engagement
   - Experiential learning creates deeper encoding

**Implementation Components:**
- **Ill-structured problems** - Complex, multiple solutions
- **Small groups** (5-8 students)
- **Facilitator** (not lecturer)
- **Self-directed learning phase**
- **Application to authentic contexts**

**When to Use:**
- Medical/professional education where practice-readiness is critical
- When transfer of knowledge is more important than recall
- When you have time for deep processing (not fast content coverage)

**Limitations:**
- Slower content coverage than lecture
- Requires significant facilitator training
- Infrastructure demands (small group spaces, resources)

### Framework 2: Hmelo-Silver PBL Process Model (2004)

**Creator:** Cindy E. Hmelo-Silver
**Domain:** Cognitive science of PBL
**Type:** Process Framework (HOW PBL works)

**The 4-Phase Cycle:**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Phase 1: Problem Presentation] --> B[Phase 2: Group Collaboration]
    B --> C[Phase 3: Self-Directed Learning SDL]
    C --> D[Phase 4: Application & Reflection]
    D --> E{Iterate?}
    E -->|Yes| B
    E -->|No| F[Conclude]
```

#### Phase 1: Problem Presentation
- Complex, ill-structured problem
- No single correct answer
- Authentic, real-world context
- Engaging hook

#### Phase 2: Group Collaboration (The Whiteboard Tool)

**Whiteboard Columns:**

| FACTS | HYPOTHESES | LEARNING ISSUES | ACTION PLAN |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| What we KNOW | Possible explanations | What we NEED to learn | Who researches what |

**Cognitive Processes:**
- Activation of prior knowledge
- Elaboration through discussion
- Social construction of knowledge
- Distributed cognition

#### Phase 3: Self-Directed Learning (SDL)
- Students independently research learning issues
- Locate quality resources
- Process information critically
- Prepare to teach peers

**Time Allocation:** Typically 3-5 days between sessions

#### Phase 4: Application & Reflection
- Share SDL findings (each teaches others)
- Apply new knowledge to original problem
- Generate solution/response
- Reflect on learning process (meta-cognition)

**Meta-Cognitive Prompts:**
- What did I learn (content)?
- How did I learn (process)?
- What strategies worked?
- What would I do differently?

**When to Use:**
- First-time PBL implementation (provides clear structure)
- Training facilitators (explicit phases)
- Designing PBL assessment (can assess each phase)

**Limitations:**
- May feel rigid to experienced PBL practitioners
- Requires discipline to not skip reflection phase

### Framework 3: The 5 Goals of PBL (Hmelo-Silver)

**Type:** Outcomes Framework (WHAT PBL achieves)
**Use Case:** Defining success criteria for PBL

**The 5 Interconnected Goals:**

#### Goal 1: Flexible Knowledge
- **Definition:** Knowledge usable in future contexts, not just recallable
- **Vs. Inert Knowledge:** Knowledge that can be recalled but not applied
- **How Achieved:** Learning in context of use, multiple retrieval contexts
- **Assessment:** Transfer problems (apply to novel situations)

#### Goal 2: Effective Problem-Solving Skills
- **Components:**
  - Problem representation (framing correctly)
  - Hypothesis generation (creative ideation)
  - Information seeking (knowing what you need to know)
  - Strategy selection (choosing approach)
  - Evaluation (assessing solution quality)
- **How Achieved:** Repeated practice with scaffolded problems
- **Assessment:** Performance on novel, ill-structured problems

#### Goal 3: Self-Directed Learning (SDL) Skills
- **SDL Cycle:**
  ```
  Recognize gap → Formulate question → Identify resources →
  Engage critically → Evaluate understanding → Identify new gaps
  ```
- **Why Critical:** Lifelong learning, professional knowledge changes rapidly
- **How Achieved:** Explicit SDL phase in every PBL, reflection on strategies
- **Assessment:** SDL documentation, metacognitive journals

#### Goal 4: Effective Collaboration Skills
- **Components:**
  - Communication (clear articulation)
  - Active listening (understanding others)
  - Conflict resolution (constructive disagreement)
  - Shared accountability (collective ownership)
  - Distributed expertise (recognizing who knows what)
- **How Achieved:** Interdependent tasks, peer assessment, facilitator coaching
- **Assessment:** Peer evaluation rubrics, observation

#### Goal 5: Intrinsic Motivation
- **Self-Determination Theory Requirements:**
  - Autonomy (control over learning)
  - Competence (feeling capable)
  - Relatedness (connection to others)
- **Observable Indicators:**
  - Research beyond requirements
  - Persistence through difficulty
  - Positive attitudes toward learning
- **How Achieved:** Student choice, scaffolded challenges, collaborative groups
- **Assessment:** Motivation surveys, engagement metrics

**Application:**
Use these 5 goals to:
1. Design PBL problems (ensure problem supports all 5)
2. Create assessment rubrics (assess all 5, not just content)
3. Justify PBL to stakeholders (goes beyond knowledge acquisition)

**Source:** Hmelo-Silver (2004)

### Framework 4: Schmidt's Cognitive Constructivist Process

**Creators:** Schmidt, Yew, Hung (2011)
**Domain:** Cognitive psychology explanation of PBL
**Type:** Mechanistic Framework (WHY PBL works)

**The 5-Phase Cognitive Cycle:**

#### Phase 1: Activation of Prior Knowledge
- Problem presented → schemas activated
- "What do I already know?"
- Prepares mind to integrate new information
- **Cognitive Mechanism:** Priming effect

#### Phase 2: Elaboration
- Group discussion = collaborative elaboration
- Explaining to peers = elaborative rehearsal (deepens encoding)
- Conflicting ideas = cognitive dissonance = restructuring
- **Cognitive Mechanism:** Depth of processing

#### Phase 3: Restructuring
- SDL = independent knowledge construction
- New information integrated with activated schemas
- Mental models reorganized
- **Cognitive Mechanism:** Schema modification

#### Phase 4: Social Knowledge Construction
- Sharing SDL findings = teaching each other
- Multiple perspectives = richer understanding
- Distributed cognition across group
- **Cognitive Mechanism:** Socially shared cognition

#### Phase 5: Contextualized Application
- Apply knowledge back to original problem
- Strengthens usability (knowledge tied to application context)
- Retrieval practice = long-term retention
- **Cognitive Mechanism:** Transfer-appropriate processing

**Why This Framework Works (Evidence from Cognitive Science):**

1. **Spacing Effect:** Time between sessions = spaced retrieval → stronger memory
2. **Retrieval Practice:** Generating hypotheses, explaining to peers = retrieval → more effective than re-reading
3. **Elaborative Encoding:** Discussion adds semantic connections → multi-modal encoding
4. **Desirable Difficulty:** Struggle to solve = deeper processing (if calibrated correctly)

**When to Use:**
- Explaining PBL to skeptical faculty (cognitive science backing)
- Designing PBL timing (spacing matters!)
- Troubleshooting ineffective PBL (which cognitive mechanism is missing?)

**Limitations:**
- Abstract (hard to operationalize without Hmelo-Silver process model)
- Requires understanding of cognitive psychology

## 🏗️ Implementation Frameworks (Tier 2 - Practical)

### Framework 5: Barrows' PBL Taxonomy (Levels 1-4)

**Purpose:** Classify "how PBL" an implementation actually is
**Use Case:** Audit existing "PBL" courses, decide implementation level

**Level 1: Lecture-Based Case Study**
- **Student Role:** Passive listener
- **Teacher Role:** Lecturer using case as example
- **Timing:** Case AFTER lecture
- **Verdict:** NOT PBL - traditional with case flavor

**Level 2: Case-Based Lectures**
- **Student Role:** Active listener, analyzes case
- **Teacher Role:** Facilitator, but guides heavily
- **Timing:** Case after some instruction
- **Verdict:** Partial PBL - still teacher-centered

**Level 3: Modified PBL**
- **Student Role:** Active inquirer
- **Teacher Role:** Facilitator
- **Timing:** Problem first, but resources provided
- **Verdict:** Mostly PBL - lacks full SDL autonomy

**Level 4: Pure PBL (Barrows' Ideal)**
- **Student Role:** Self-directed learner
- **Teacher Role:** Coach, minimal guidance
- **Timing:** Problem BEFORE all instruction
- **Resources:** Students find own resources
- **Verdict:** Full PBL - complete autonomy, SDL, iteration

**Barrows' Position:** Only Level 4 deserves "PBL" label

**Modern Consensus:** Level 3-4 both considered PBL; Level 4 ideal but Level 3 often necessary for novice learners

**Application:**
- Use this to **honestly assess** your current implementation
- If claiming "PBL" but at Level 2 → Either upgrade or rebrand
- Progression: Start Level 3, work toward Level 4 over time

**Source:** Barrows (1986), Medical Education, 20(6), 481-486

- Ensure group understands all terminology
- Prevents misunderstandings

**Jump 2: Define the Problem**
- What is the core issue/question?
- Frame problem clearly

**Jump 3: Brainstorm**
- What do we already know?

**Jump 6: Independent Study**
- Research learning issues independently

**Session 2: Synthesis (Jump 7)**

**Jump 7: Share, Synthesize, Apply**
- Teach each other
- Integrate knowledge
- Solve problem

**Comparison to Hmelo-Silver 4-Phase:**
- More granular (7 vs. 4 steps)
- Explicit "clarify terms" step (useful for novices or technical fields)
- Same underlying logic

**When to Use:**
- Technical/medical fields with heavy jargon
- Novice PBL students (more structure helpful)
- European context (common standard there)

## 🌍 Contextual Frameworks (Tier 4 - Adaptations)

### Framework 11: Brazilian ABP Model (Problematização vs. ABP)

**Context:** Brazil has TWO distinct "problem-based" methods
**Importance:** Understanding difference prevents confusion

**Método da Problematização (Maguerez Arc)**
1. Observação da realidade (observe reality)
2. Pontos-chave identificados (identify key points)
3. Teorização (theorize)
4. Hipóteses de solução (solution hypotheses)
5. Aplicação à realidade (apply to reality)

**Características:**
- Starts with observation of real situation
- Strong social justice / Paulo Freire influence
- Action-oriented (apply back to reality)
- Common in Brazilian public health education

**ABP - Aprendizagem Baseada em Problemas (Barrows)**
1. Problema apresentado (problem presented)
2. Discussão em grupo (group discussion)
3. Aprendizagem autodirigida (SDL)
4. Aplicação ao problema (application to problem)
5. Avaliação (evaluation)

**Características:**
- Starts with pre-designed problem (not observation)
- Cognitive constructivist foundation
- Knowledge-building oriented
- Imported from McMaster/Maastricht

**Critical Distinction:**
- **Problematização:** Observe reality → identify problem → theorize → solve
- **ABP:** Given problem → research → apply

**When to Use Each:**
- **Problematização:** Community-based learning, social issues, public health
- **ABP:** Professional skill development, knowledge-intensive domains

**Source:** Brazilian SCIELO literature (Cadernos de Saúde Pública)

- **In-Class (Session 1):** PBL problem, whiteboard collaboration
- **Between Classes (Online):** SDL, asynchronous discussion
- **In-Class (Session 2):** Application, reflection
- **Challenges:** Less "pure" PBL, cognitive load managing two modes
- **Benefits:** Addresses content coverage concerns, scaffolds for novices

**When to Use:**
- **Synchronous:** When real-time energy is important, students have reliable internet
- **Asynchronous:** Distributed teams, working professionals, reflection time needed
- **Hybrid:** First-time PBL implementation, content-heavy courses

**Source:** Post-pandemic PBL literature (2020-2024)

## 🔬 Theoretical Frameworks (Tier 6 - Foundations)

### Framework 16: Constructivist Learning Theory Applied to PBL

**Theorists:** Piaget, Vygotsky, Bruner
**Application to PBL:**

**Piaget: Cognitive Constructivism**
- **Core Idea:** Learners construct knowledge through interaction with environment
- **PBL Application:**
  - Problems create cognitive dissonance (disequilibrium)
  - Students accommodate (modify schemas) to resolve
  - Active construction, not passive reception
- **Evidence in PBL:** Students generate own understanding, not receive teacher's

**Vygotsky: Social Constructivism**
- **Core Idea:** Knowledge is socially constructed; Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)
- **PBL Application:**
  - Group work = social construction of knowledge
  - Facilitator scaffolds within ZPD
  - More knowledgeable peers support learning
- **Evidence in PBL:** Discussion deepens understanding beyond individual capacity

**Bruner: Discovery Learning**
- **Core Idea:** Learning is active process of discovering structure
- **PBL Application:**
  - Students discover relationships, not told
  - Spiral curriculum (revisit concepts with increasing complexity)
- **Evidence in PBL:** Pattern recognition across multiple problems

**Synthesis:**
PBL is applied constructivism - problems are the environment for active, social construction of knowledge.

**Source:** Educational psychology foundations

---

### Framework 17: Situated Cognition Theory Applied to PBL

**Theorists:** Brown, Collins, Duguid (1989)
**Core Idea:** Knowledge is inseparable from context; learning is situated in activity

**Key Concepts:**

**1. Authentic Activity**
- Knowledge is used in context of use
- "Knowing" and "doing" are intertwined
- **PBL Application:** Authentic problems = authentic context

**2. Cognitive Apprenticeship**
- Learning through modeling, coaching, scaffolding
- Gradual release of responsibility
- **PBL Application:** Facilitator models expert reasoning, fades support

**3. Community of Practice**
- Learning is participation in community
- Legitimate peripheral participation
- **PBL Application:** Small groups as learning community

**4. Transfer Through Similarity of Context**
- Transfer enhanced when learning and application contexts similar
- **PBL Application:** Professional scenarios → transfer to professional practice

**Implications for PBL Design:**
1. Use problems from real practice (not textbook abstractions)
2. Include authentic constraints (time, budget, politics)
3. Assess in similar contexts (not decontextualized exams)

**Source:** Brown, Collins, & Duguid (1989), "Situated Cognition and the Culture of Learning"

### Framework 18: Experiential Learning Theory (Kolb) Applied to PBL

**Creator:** David Kolb (1984)
**Model:** 4-Stage Cycle

**Kolb's Cycle:**
```
Concrete Experience → Reflective Observation →
Abstract Conceptualization → Active Experimentation → (repeat)
```

**Mapped to PBL:**

| Kolb Stage | PBL Phase | Activity |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| **Concrete Experience** | Problem Presentation | Encounter problem, initial reaction |
| **Reflective Observation** | Group Discussion | Discuss what problem means, brainstorm |
| **Abstract Conceptualization** | SDL | Research, build understanding, theorize |
| **Active Experimentation** | Application | Test knowledge by solving problem |

**Insight:** PBL is a structured Kolb cycle
- Each PBL problem = one complete cycle
- Semester-long PBL = spiral through multiple cycles
- Reflection phase explicitly built in (many other methods skip this)

**Learning Styles Accommodation:**
- **Divergers** (feeling + watching): Engage in problem brainstorming
- **Assimilators** (watching + thinking): Excel in SDL, theory-building
- **Convergers** (thinking + doing): Thrive in application phase
- **Accommodators** (doing + feeling): Drive group action

**PBL advantage:** Hits all 4 stages → engages all learning styles
