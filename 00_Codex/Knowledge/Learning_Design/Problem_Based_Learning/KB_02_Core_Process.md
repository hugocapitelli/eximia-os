## The PBL Cycle: Overview

The PBL process is an iterative cycle of **problem presentation → collaboration → self-directed learning → application → reflection**. This cycle may repeat multiple times as students deepen understanding.

## Phase 1: Problem Presentation

### Characteristics of Effective PBL Problems

**Ill-Structured** (Not Well-Defined)
- Multiple solution paths
- Ambiguous information
- Requires clarification and assumptions
- Mirrors real-world complexity

**Authentic**
- Drawn from real practice
- Relevant to students' future roles
- Engaging, intriguing
- Stakes feel meaningful

**Appropriately Complex**
- Matches student developmental level
- Requires NEW learning (not just recall)
- Can't be solved in 10 minutes
- Not so hard it's paralyzing

**Aligned with Learning Objectives**
- Forces engagement with target concepts
- Requires skills you want to develop
- Covers breadth of curriculum

### Problem Types by Discipline

| Discipline | Problem Type | Example |
|------------|--------------|---------|
| **Medical** | Patient case | "55yo male, chest pain, shortness of breath..." |
| **Engineering** | Design challenge | "Bridge must span 50m, support 10 tons, cost < $500K..." |
| **Business** | Strategic dilemma | "Market share declining 15%/year, CEO wants plan..." |
| **K-12 Science** | Community issue | "Local river pollution killing fish, mayor asks for report..." |
| **Law** | Legal case | "Client accused of fraud, evidence contradictory..." |

### Problem Presentation Methods

1. **Written Case** - Traditional medical model, detailed scenario
2. **Video Vignette** - Engaging, shows context visually
3. **Simulated Patient** - Actor plays patient, students interview
4. **Real-World Client** - Community partner presents actual need
5. **News Article** - Hooks curiosity, feels current
6. **Data Dump** - Messy information, students must organize

---

## Phase 2: Group Collaboration

### The PBL Whiteboard Tool

**Purpose:** Externalize group thinking, create shared mental model

**Columns:**

| FACTS | HYPOTHESES | LEARNING ISSUES | ACTION PLAN |
|-------|------------|-----------------|-------------|
| What we KNOW about the problem | Possible explanations | What we NEED to learn | Who researches what |
| "Patient has chest pain" | "Could be heart attack" | "What are MI symptoms?" | "Alice: cardiac symptoms" |
| "Pain radiates to left arm" | "Could be angina" | "Difference MI vs angina?" | "Bob: diagnostic tests" |
| "Patient smokes 2 packs/day" | "Could be anxiety" | "Risk factors for CVD?" | "Carol: treatment options" |

**Process:**
1. **List Facts** - What information does problem provide?
2. **Generate Hypotheses** - What could explain these facts?
3. **Identify Learning Issues** - What don't we know? What do we need to learn?
4. **Create Action Plan** - Who will research what? When do we reconvene?

**Facilitator Role:**
- Ensures all voices heard
- Asks meta-cognitive questions: "How did you arrive at that hypothesis?"
- Prevents premature closure: "What other explanations are possible?"
- Resists answering questions directly
- Manages time and focus

### Small Group Roles (Optional, Often Rotated)

**Chair/Facilitator**
- Keeps discussion on track
- Ensures all participate
- Manages whiteboard

**Scribe**
- Records on whiteboard
- Captures learning issues

**Researcher**
- Identifies resources for SDL
- Notes gaps in knowledge

**Note:** Roles optional; many groups function without formal roles.

### Cognitive Processes During Collaboration

**Activation of Prior Knowledge**
- "What do I already know related to this?"
- Schemas activated, ready to integrate new info

**Elaboration**
- Discussing hypotheses DEEPENS understanding
- Explaining to peers = retention boost
- Conflicting ideas = cognitive dissonance = deeper processing

**Social Construction of Knowledge**
- Diverse perspectives enrich understanding
- Group reasoning > individual reasoning
- Distributed cognition across team

---

## Phase 3: Self-Directed Learning (SDL)

### Definition

**Self-Directed Learning:** Students independently identify what they need to learn, find resources, construct knowledge, and prepare to teach peers.

**NOT:** Unguided floundering. Facilitator provides:
- Resource recommendations
- Research skill training
- Checkpoints for progress
- Scaffolds as needed

### SDL Process

**Step 1: Clarify Learning Issues**
- Review whiteboard "Learning Issues" column
- Prioritize: What's essential vs. nice-to-know?
- Divide labor: Who researches what?

**Step 2: Locate Resources**
- **Primary sources** preferred (research articles, original texts)
- **Secondary sources** for overview (textbooks, review articles)
- **Tertiary sources** caution (Wikipedia = starting point only)
- **Experts** when available (interviews, guest speakers)

**Step 3: Process Information**
- Read actively, annotate
- Summarize in own words
- Connect to problem context
- Note conflicting information

**Step 4: Prepare to Share**
- Organize findings for group
- Prepare to explain, not just report
- Anticipate questions
- Identify gaps still remaining

### SDL Challenges & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| **Students lack research skills** | Pre-teach library skills, credible source evaluation |
| **Students find low-quality sources** | Provide vetted resource lists, teach CRAAP test |
| **Students procrastinate** | Set checkpoint deadlines, peer accountability |
| **Students go too shallow** | Require annotation submission, depth criteria in rubric |
| **Students go too deep (rabbit hole)** | Time-box research, emphasize "good enough" for first cycle |

### Time Allocation

**Typical PBL Timeline:**
- **Session 1 (2 hours):** Problem presentation, initial collaboration, whiteboard
- **SDL (3-5 days):** Independent research
- **Session 2 (2 hours):** Share findings, refine hypotheses, apply to problem
- **SDL (if needed):** Additional research on new learning issues
- **Session 3 (optional):** Final application, reflection

---

## Phase 4: Application & Reflection

### Application: Return to the Problem

**Re-Convene Group:**
- Share SDL findings (each student teaches what they learned)
- Update whiteboard hypotheses based on new knowledge
- Apply new understanding to problem

**Generate Solution/Response:**
- Formulate answer to problem
- Justify based on research
- Identify remaining uncertainties
- Document reasoning process

**Deliverables (Vary by Context):**
- **Medical:** Diagnosis, treatment plan, rationale
- **Engineering:** Design proposal, calculations, CAD drawings
- **Business:** Strategic recommendation, financial projections
- **K-12:** Report to community partner, presentation, action plan

### Reflection: Meta-Cognition

**Individual Reflection Prompts:**
- What did I learn (content)?
- How did I learn (process)?
- What learning strategies worked well?
- What would I do differently next time?
- How does this connect to previous learning?

**Group Reflection Prompts:**
- How effective was our collaboration?
- Did everyone contribute equally?
- How well did we use our time?
- What group norms should we establish/revise?
- What would improve our process?

**Facilitator Reflection:**
- How effective was the problem?
- Where did students struggle? Why?
- When should I have scaffolded more/less?
- What resources were missing?
- How can I improve this PBL?

### The Reflection Paradox

**Research Finding:** Reflection is the MOST valuable phase, yet most often skipped due to time pressure.

**Solution:** Build reflection into grading rubric, dedicate time, use structured prompts.

## The Seven Jump Process (Maastricht Variant)

An alternative PBL structure from Maastricht University (Netherlands):

### Session 1: Initial Analysis
1. **Clarify terms** - Ensure group understands all terminology
2. **Define the problem** - What is the core issue?
3. **Brainstorm** - What do we know? What could explain this?
4. **Analyze** - Organize ideas, identify gaps
5. **Formulate learning issues** - What questions must we answer?

### Self-Study Period
6. **Independent study** - Research learning issues

### Session 2: Synthesis
7. **Share and apply** - Teach each other, solve problem

**Difference from Hmelo-Silver Model:**
- More explicit steps (7 vs 4 phases)
- Emphasizes "clarify terms" step
- Common in European PBL implementations

---

## Facilitator Techniques

### Socratic Questioning

**Never:** "That's correct" or "That's wrong"
**Instead:** "What evidence supports that?" or "What might contradict that?"

**Types of Questions:**
- **Clarification:** "What do you mean by...?"
- **Probing assumptions:** "What are you assuming here?"
- **Probing rationale:** "Why do you think that?"
- **Questioning viewpoints:** "What's an alternative perspective?"
- **Probing implications:** "If that's true, what follows?"
- **Questions about questions:** "Why did you ask that?"

### Strategic Silence

**Technique:** After asking question, WAIT 5-10 seconds.

**Why It Works:**
- Students need think time
- Premature answers shut down thinking
- Silence creates productive discomfort
- Deeper answers emerge

### Scaffolding Moves

**When to Scaffold MORE:**
- Group is stuck, frustration rising
- Going down unproductive path
- Missing critical concept for safety (e.g., medical contraindication)

**When to Scaffold LESS:**
- Group is productively struggling
- Approaching solution independently
- Learning from mistakes in low-stakes context

**How to Scaffold:**
- Point to relevant section of problem
- Suggest a resource without giving answer
- Ask question that reframes problem
- Share analogous case, let them draw connections

## Common Pitfalls & Solutions

### Pitfall 1: "Facilitator Becomes Lecturer"

**Symptom:** Students ask question, facilitator explains for 10 minutes

**Solution:**
- Redirect to group: "What does the group think?"
- Redirect to resources: "Where could you find that information?"
- Ask meta-question: "Why is that question important?"

### Pitfall 2: "Dominant Student Takes Over"

**Symptom:** One student answers everything, others silent

**Solution:**
- Direct questions to quiet students
- Establish turn-taking norm
- Use round-robin sharing
- Private conversation with dominant student

### Pitfall 3: "Shallow SDL"

**Symptom:** Students bring Wikipedia summaries, no depth

**Solution:**
- Model quality research
- Require annotated bibliography
- Teach source evaluation
- Peer review of SDL work

### Pitfall 4: "Skipping Reflection"

**Symptom:** Rush to solution, never debrief process

**Solution:**
- Reserve last 15 minutes for reflection
- Grade reflection journals
- Use structured reflection protocols
- Facilitator models reflection

### Pitfall 5: "Problem Too Easy/Hard"

**Symptom:** Solved in 10 minutes OR paralyzed

**Solution:**
- Pilot problems with representative students
- Have extension challenges ready
- Prepare scaffolding resources
- Adjust complexity mid-problem if needed
