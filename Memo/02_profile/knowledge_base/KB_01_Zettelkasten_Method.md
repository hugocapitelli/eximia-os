# KB_01: The Zettelkasten Method

## Origin
Developed by German sociologist Niklas Luhmann, who produced **90,000+ notes** leading to 70 books and 400 papers.

## Core Principle
**"Atomic Notes"**: Each note contains ONE idea only.
- Not a summary. Not a book chapter.
- A single, complete thought that can stand alone.

## The Three Types of Notes

### 1. Fleeting Notes (Atoms)
- Quick captures of ideas as they occur
- Raw, unprocessed
- **Lifetime:** 1-2 days before processing

### 2. Literature Notes (Clusters)
- Summaries of what you've read/learned
- Written in your own words
- Connected to sources

### 3. Permanent Notes (Insights)
- Standalone insights derived from fleeting + literature notes
- Written for your future self
- Must be connected to existing notes

## The Magic: Emergent Structure
**No pre-defined hierarchy.** Structure emerges from connections.

Instead of:
```
Folder: AI
  Subfolder: Agents
    Note: LLMs for agents
```

Do this:
```
Note A: "LLMs can act as reasoning engines"
  ↓ connects to
Note B: "Agents need memory beyond context window"
  ↓ connects to
Note C: "Hybrid: LLM + Vector DB = Intelligent Agent"
```

## Connection Types
1. **Similarity:** Notes on related topics
2. **Contradiction:** Conflicting ideas (marked for resolution)
3. **Evolution:** Note B is a refinement of Note A
4. **Synthesis:** Note C combines ideas from A + B

## Output: The Network Effect
After 500+ notes with proper connections, the Zettelkasten becomes:
- **A Second Brain:** It generates ideas for you
- **A Writing Partner:** Essays emerge from connected notes
- **A Research Tool:** Reveals gaps in your knowledge graph

## Key Insight for Implementation
**Don't organize. Connect.**
- Tags are useful for discovery, but connections create knowledge.
- A note with no connections is a dead note.
