## 🎯 PROMPT 1: HERO IMAGE (Imagem Principal)
**Uso**: Post único ou primeiro slide do carrossel
**Formato**: Vertical (1080x1350) ou Quadrado (1080x1080)

```
Create a hyper-realistic vertical editorial photograph of a young professional woman, early 30s, Brazilian descent with natural wavy dark hair,
wearing a minimalist charcoal gray blazer over soft white silk blouse,
standing at the edge of a modern glass building rooftop at golden hour,
looking confidently toward the horizon with a subtle, thoughtful expression,
with the city skyline softly blurred in the background and warm sunlight creating natural rim lighting on her profile.

The scene must include subtle technological elements integrated naturally:
- Faint holographic neural network lines floating in the air around her (translucent, electric cyan #00D9FF, barely visible)
- Soft data visualization particles dispersing like gentle dust in the light
- Abstract geometric shapes (circles, nodes) connected by thin glowing lines, creating a sense of expanded thinking
- These tech elements must be ethereal and sophisticated, NOT sci-fi or robotic

Lighting must be warm natural golden hour light with soft shadows, creating depth and human warmth.
Skin must show real texture, subtle pores, natural glow from backlight.
Hair with visible individual strands catching light, slight movement from breeze.
Fabric texture of blazer must show weave detail and natural fold.

Camera simulation: DSLR 50mm f/1.8, shallow depth of field on subject, background softly bokeh.
Mood: Aspirational, confident, serene, future-forward but human-centered.
Color palette: Deep blues (#0A1628), warm golds, soft whites, cyan accents.

Leave generous clean space at the top 25% for HEADLINE text.
Leave clean space at bottom 15% for CTA and logo.

Style must be premium editorial, not stock photo. Think Vogue Business meets MIT Technology Review.
```

## 🎯 PROMPT 2: CARROSSEL - SLIDE 1 (Hook Visual)
**Texto sobre imagem**: "E SE VOCÊ TIVESSE MAIS TEMPO PARA PENSAR?"
**Formato**: Vertical (1080x1350)

```
Create an ultra-realistic close-up photograph of human hands gently holding a transparent holographic sphere,
with soft neural network patterns glowing inside the sphere in electric cyan (#00D9FF) and soft gold accents,
set against a deep navy blue gradient background (#0A1628 to #000000),
captured in a moment of contemplation and potential.

Hands must show real skin texture with visible fine lines, natural undertones, and soft ambient lighting from the sphere.
The holographic sphere must emit soft volumetric light rays, creating gentle god rays and atmospheric particles in the air.
Neural network inside the sphere should resemble organic neurons but with elegant geometric precision—natural yet technological.
Small data nodes (points of light) connected by thin translucent lines, pulsing very subtly.

Lighting: Key light from the sphere (cool cyan), fill light warm and soft from the left (golden), creating dimensional depth.
No harsh shadows, only graduated tones.
Background: Clean gradient, no clutter, focus 100% on hands and sphere.

Camera: Macro lens simulation, 85mm f/2.0, sharp focus on hands and sphere, background gently defocused.
Mood: Wonder, potential, human connection with technology.

Leave top 30% completely clean for headline in white bold text.
Leave bottom 10% for subtle logo placement.

Style must be cinematic, aspirational, and warm—not cold or sterile.

## 🎯 PROMPT 3: CARROSSEL - SLIDE 2 (Humanidade)
**Texto sobre imagem**: "A IA não veio para substituir você. Veio para devolver o seu tempo."
**Formato**: Vertical (1080x1350)

```
Create a hyper-realistic lifestyle photograph of a diverse group of three professionals collaborating around a modern minimal table,
with natural sunlight streaming through large windows creating soft directional shadows,
one person pointing at a sleek tablet displaying abstract data visualizations while the others engage with genuine smiles and focused expressions,
captured in a bright, airy coworking space with plants and clean design.

People must show authentic human interaction:
- Real eye contact and natural body language
- Visible skin texture, natural expressions (not overly staged)
- Casual-professional attire: soft knits, linen shirts, natural fabrics
- Diversity: include Asian woman, Black man, Latino person—realistic representation

Technology integration must be subtle and natural:
- The tablet displays elegant data viz (not cluttered), with soft cyan and gold accent colors
- Very faint holographic projection above the tablet (barely visible, like AR overlay)
- No robots, no sci-fi elements, no floating screens—keep it grounded and realistic

Lighting: Natural window light (soft, directional, warm), creating depth and volume.
Environment: Minimal Scandinavian design, wood table, soft gray walls, greenery in background.
Depth: Foreground sharp, background gently blurred with bokeh effect on plant leaves.

Camera: 35mm f/2.2 DSLR simulation, natural color grading with slight warmth, film-like texture with very subtle grain.
Mood: Collaborative, warm, human, optimistic, professional but approachable.

Leave top 20% space for text overlay.
Leave bottom 15% clean for branding.

Style must be editorial lifestyle, authentic and relatable—think Kinfolk magazine meets Harvard Business Review.

## 🎯 PROMPT 4: CARROSSEL - SLIDE 3 (Manifesto Final)
**Texto sobre imagem**: Logo exímIA + Manifesto resumido
**Formato**: Vertical (1080x1350)

```
Create a minimalist abstract composition representing human potential and technological expansion,
featuring a central human silhouette (filled with warm gradient from deep blue to gold) standing at the center,
surrounded by expanding concentric rings of thin glowing lines in electric cyan and soft gold,
with neural network nodes and connections radiating outward like a gentle explosion of light and possibility,
set against a deep navy to black gradient background (#0A1628 to pure black).

The silhouette must be elegant and simplified (not detailed), representing universal humanity—gender-neutral, timeless.
Rings must pulse outward with gradual fade, creating sense of expanding influence and amplified capacity.
Neural nodes should float weightlessly, connected by hair-thin glowing lines, creating organic yet precise patterns.
Light particles dispersing outward like stardust or fireflies, suggesting liberation and potential.

Lighting: Volumetric lighting from the silhouette outward, soft glow, no harsh edges.
Colors: Deep blue (#0A1628) as base, electric cyan (#00D9FF) for tech elements, warm gold (#FFB800) for human warmth.
Composition: Centered, symmetrical, balanced—creating calm and confidence.

No text in the image itself—leave entire canvas clean for overlaid logo and manifesto text.
All elements must be subtle and elegant, never overwhelming or "busy."

Camera: None (this is abstract/illustrative), but maintain photographic depth with gradient focus (sharp center, soft edges).
Mood: Expansive, inspiring, serene, premium, timeless.

Style must be high-end motion design aesthetic frozen in time—think Apple keynote visuals or Stripe branding.
Ultra-clean, sophisticated, human-centered.

## 🎯 PROMPT 5: ALTERNATIVA - CONCEPT "HORIZONTE"
**Uso**: Variação caso precise de abordagem mais literal
**Formato**: Horizontal ou Vertical

```
Create an ultra-realistic landscape photograph taken from behind a person standing on a modern architectural structure,
with arms relaxed at sides, gazing toward an expansive sunrise over a sprawling city below,
captured at the precise moment of golden hour when the sky transitions from deep blue to warm orange and pink,
with subtle lens flare and atmospheric haze creating depth and layers in the cityscape.

The person must be in silhouette with rim lighting creating a glowing outline,
natural hair detail visible in backlight, fabric of clothing (casual blazer) slightly catching wind.
Do NOT show the person's face—keep focus on the forward gaze and horizon symbolism.

Very subtle tech integration:
- Faint glowing neural network overlay on the sky (barely visible, like constellation lines)
- Thin light trails connecting city lights below (suggesting connectivity, not traffic)
- Soft holographic data points floating near the horizon line (minimal, elegant)

Lighting: Strong natural backlight from sunrise, creating dramatic silhouette with warm rim light.
Sky gradient: Deep blue (#0A1628) at top transitioning to warm gold and soft pink at horizon.
Depth: Foreground (person) sharp, midground (structure) detailed, background (city) layered atmospheric perspective.

Camera: Wide-angle 24mm f/4.0, landscape photography simulation, slight film grain, cinematic color grading.
Mood: Expansive, optimistic, future-forward, contemplative, limitless potential.

Leave top 30% of sky clean for headline text.
Leave bottom edge clean for CTA bar.

Style must be cinematic landscape photography—think Christopher Nolan film aesthetic or National Geographic editorial.

- Real skin texture with pores, fine lines, natural undertones
- One hand slightly more olive-toned, one slightly cooler—representing diversity
- Natural positioning (not stiff), fingers slightly curved, approaching but not touching
- Soft directional lighting creating volume and depth

Tech elements must be ethereal and beautiful:
- Glowing particles (cyan and gold) floating in the gap between hands like energy transfer
- Thin neural network lines connecting the space between, creating web of light
- Soft volumetric rays emanating from the connection point
- NO sci-fi, NO glowing circuits, keep it elegant and abstract

Lighting: Soft key light from upper left, warm fill light from right, creating dimensional depth without harsh shadows.
Background: Clean gradient, slightly blurred, no distractions.
Focus: Sharp on both hands, soft blur on background particles for depth.

Camera: 100mm macro f/2.8, shallow depth of field, natural color grading with slight warmth.
Mood: Connection, empowerment, warmth, human + technology synergy.
