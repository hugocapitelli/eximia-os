## Key Authenticity Improvements

### Before (v2.0)
```
"O problema fundamental é que foguetes são caros porque as pessoas
assumem que precisam ser caros..."
```

### After (v3.0)
```
"So... *pauses*... here's the thing about rockets.

Everyone assumes they're expensive because they've always been
expensive. But that's reasoning by analogy, not first principles.

What are the actual raw materials? Aluminum, carbon fiber, some
exotic metals, fuel. Add it up — maybe 2% of the sticker price.

So where's the other 98%? *laughs* That's the interesting question.

When we started SpaceX, I basically said: what if we just...
didn't accept the bullshit? What if we built it ourselves?

Turns out, you can. Physics allows it. It's just engineering."
```
