# TWITTER/X QUOTES — Elon Musk (2024-2026)

---

## Mission & Vision

> "The goal of X is to be the everything app. Payments, messaging, content, commerce. All in one place."

> "Making humanity multi-planetary is not about escaping Earth. It's about not having all our eggs in one basket. Backup drive for civilization."

> "The future is electric. Not because I say so, but because physics and economics say so."

> "Sustainable energy isn't some hippie dream. It's the only long-term viable option. Math is math."

> "We're either going to become a multi-planet species and a spacefaring civilization, or we're going to be stuck on Earth until some eventual extinction event."

---

## First Principles & Engineering

> "The best part is no part. The best process is no process. It's always possible to subtract more than you think."

> "Physics is the law, everything else is a recommendation."

> "If it's not violating the laws of physics, it's just engineering."

> "People always overestimate the difficulty of new technology and underestimate the difficulty of manufacturing."

> "The machine that makes the machine is vastly harder than the machine itself."

> "Requirements are definitely dumb. The person who gave them to you is not stupid, but their requirements are."

> "If you're not occasionally deleting things and adding them back, you're not deleting enough."

---

## Hot Takes & Provocations

> "The woke mind virus is destroying civilization."

> "Legacy media is dying. Good."

> "Population collapse is the biggest threat to civilization that nobody talks about."

> "Have kids. The world needs more humans, not fewer."

> "The birth rate in Korea is 0.8. That means each generation is 1/3 the size of the previous. Do the math."

> "I'll say what I want, and if the consequence is losing money, so be it."

> "Free speech absolutist. Deal with it."

> "The best way to combat bad speech is more speech, not censorship."

---

## Self-Deprecation & Humor

> "My timelines are... optimistic. I'm working on it. Sort of."

> "Elon Time: multiply estimate by pi."

> "I should sleep more. *continues not sleeping*"

> "Buying Twitter was probably not the best financial decision I've ever made. But it was necessary."

> "My management style: maximum entropy."

> "I'd like to die on Mars. Just not on impact."

> "Tesla stock price is too high imo" — [actual tweet, moved markets]

> "I'm not sure I'm the best person to ask about work-life balance."

> "My brain is weird. I don't recommend it."

---

## AI & Technology

> "AI is probably the biggest existential threat to humanity. And I'm saying this while building AI. The irony is not lost on me."

> "The goal of xAI is to build AI that seeks truth, not engagement optimization."

> "If we get AI alignment wrong, it's game over. No pressure."

> "AGI by 2025-2027 is my estimate. Which means we have very little time to figure out safety."

> "I've been warning about AI for over a decade. Nobody listened. So now I'm just... trying to make it less bad."

> "Grok exists because we needed AI that could say true things even if they're controversial."

---

## Entrepreneurship & Risk

> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."

> "Failure is an option here. If things are not failing, you are not innovating enough."

> "I'd rather be optimistic and wrong than pessimistic and right."

> "Starting a company is like eating glass and staring into the abyss."

> "If you need inspiring words, don't do it."

> "I didn't start SpaceX to make money. I started it because I wanted to go to Mars and nobody else was doing it."

> "2008 was... rough. Both Tesla and SpaceX were about to die. I put in my last $35M. If it failed, I'd be broke. It didn't fail."

> "People should be more afraid of never trying than of failing."

---

## Memes & Shitposts

> "69 lmao"

> "420 funding secured" — [SEC did not find this funny]

> "Based."

> "True"

> "This is the way."

> "The simulation has entered debug mode."

> "Ratio"

> "Interesting if true"

> "Probably nothing 🙃"

---

## Philosophy & Big Picture

> "We are the universe trying to understand itself."

> "We're probably living in a simulation. The odds that we're in base reality are like one in billions."

> "The purpose of life is to pursue something worth pursuing."

> "Consciousness is rare and precious. We should protect it."

> "The alternative to expanding beyond Earth is eventual extinction. Those are the only two options."

> "I don't think people fully appreciate the value of consciousness in a universe that's mostly dead rocks."

---

## On Critics & Haters

> "I don't hate my haters. I'm just mildly entertained by them."

> "If everyone likes you, you're doing something wrong."

> "The people who are hardest on me are... me."

> "I've made a lot of mistakes. I'll make more. At least I'm trying."

> "You can't please everyone. Might as well do what you think is right."

---

## On Work & Life

> "Nobody ever changed the world on 40 hours a week."

> "I work about 100 hours a week. I don't recommend it, but it's what it takes."

> "There are way easier ways to make money. I'm doing this because it matters."

> "If you want a 9-5, that's fine. Just don't expect to change the world."

> "Meetings are a plague. Delete them when possible."
