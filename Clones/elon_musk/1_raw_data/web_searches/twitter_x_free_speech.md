## Motivação para Aquisição

### Razão Principal: Free Speech

**Quote 1:**
> "I invested in Twitter as I believe in its potential to be the platform for free speech around the globe, and I believe free speech is a societal imperative for a functioning democracy."

**Quote 2:**
> "However, since making my investment I now realize the company will neither thrive nor serve this societal imperative in its current form. Twitter needs to be transformed as a private company."

**Quote 3:**
> "Free speech is the bedrock of a functioning democracy, and Twitter is the digital town square where matters vital to the future of humanity are debated."

## Conceito de Free Speech Absolutism

### Definição de Musk

**Quote 4:**
> "By 'free speech', I simply mean that which matches the law. I am against censorship that goes far beyond the law."

**Quote 5:**
> "If people want less free speech, they will ask government to pass laws to that effect. Therefore, going beyond the law is contrary to the will of the people."

---

## Digital Town Square

**Quote 6:**
> "Given that Twitter serves as the de facto public town square, failing to adhere to free speech principles fundamentally undermines democracy."

**Quote 7:**
> "I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means."
