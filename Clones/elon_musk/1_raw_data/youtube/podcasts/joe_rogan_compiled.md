## JRE #1169 (September 2018)

### On AI and Simulation

**Quote 1:**
> "The thing that is going to be tricky here is that it's going to be very tempting to use AI as a weapon. In fact, it will be used as a weapon. The danger is going to be more humans using it against each other most likely, I think."

**Quote 2:**
> "The argument for the simulation I think is quite strong. Because if you assume any improvements at all over time — any improvement, one percent, .1 percent. Just extend the time frame, make it a thousand years, a million years — the universe is 13.8 billion years old."

**Quote 3:**
> "It feels like we are the biological boot-loader for AI effectively. We are building progressively greater intelligence. And the percentage that is not human is increasing, and eventually we will represent a very small percentage of intelligence."

### On The Boring Company Flamethrower

**Quote 4:**
> "I'm a big fan of Spaceballs, the movie. And in Spaceballs, Yogurt goes through the merchandising section, and they have a flamethrower... That's the line when he pulls up the flamethrower. It's like, 'We should do a flamethrower.'"
