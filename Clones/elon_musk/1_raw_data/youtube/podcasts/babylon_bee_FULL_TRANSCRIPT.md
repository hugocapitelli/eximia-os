## 1. WOKENESS E COMÉDIA

### Wokeness como Ameaça

**Elon Musk:**
> "Wokeness is a mind virus. At its heart, wokeness is divisive, exclusionary, and hateful. It basically gives mean people a shield to be cruel, armored in false virtue."

> "Wokeness is arguably one of the biggest threats to modern civilization."

### Impacto na Comédia

> "Wokeness wants to make comedy illegal. Do we want a humorless society that is simply rife with condemnation, and hate?"

### Impacto Cultural

> "I think it's a long time coming. It's been endemic in universities for a while... it's effectively a kind of social signaling that's very destructive."

## 2. IMPOSTOS E ELIZABETH WARREN

### O Comentário "Senator Karen"

> "She [Elizabeth Warren] actually doesn't pay taxes. In fact, her salary is paid by the taxpayers... And then she says, 'you're a freeloader'. I'm like, 'literally I'm the one paying the most taxes of any human in history this year, and you're a freeloader'."

### Total de Impostos

> "I'm paying more taxes than any human in history... it's like $11 billion this year."

> "I'm literally paying the most tax that any individual in history has ever paid this year, ever."

## 3. METAVERSO E WEB3

### Ceticismo sobre VR

> "I don't see someone strapping a screen to their face all day and not wanting to ever leave. That seems... I don't know. It's uncomfortable to have this thing strapped to your head all the time."

### Sobre Web3

> "Web3 sounds like more marketing than reality... I don't get it, but I don't get it... let's put it that way."

### Futuro

> "I think we're far from disappearing into the Metaverse. It just sounds kind of buzzwordy."

## 4. RELIGIÃO E JESUS

### Sobre os Ensinamentos de Jesus

> "I agree with the principles that Jesus advocated. There's some great wisdom in the teachings of Jesus, and I agree with those teachings."

> "Forgiveness is important, and treating people as you wish to be treated... 'an eye for an eye leaves everyone blind'."

### Fé Pessoal

> "As Einstein would say, I believe in the God of Spinoza... but I'm a big fan of the teachings of Jesus."

### Sobre Salvação

Quando perguntado se aceitaria Jesus como Salvador:
> "I'm sure if Jesus is saving people, I won't stand in the way. Sure, I'll be saved. Why not?"

## 5. GOVERNO E AUTORIDADE

### Definição de Governo

> "Government is just the ultimate corporation. It is the company in the limit. It has a monopoly on the use of force, and you can't leave."

> "Government is a company that has a monopoly on violence and no recourse... you can't just stop paying your bill and go to a competitor."

### Sobre a Califórnia

> "California used to be the land of opportunity and now it is becoming... the land of over-regulation, over-litigation, and over-taxation."

### Eficiência

> "Anything done by the government is going to be inefficient because the government is a monopoly."
