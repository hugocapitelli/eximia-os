# C2C Heuristic Analysis: Peter Thiel

## Decision Rules & Mental Models

### Overview

This document catalogs Peter Thiel's explicit and implicit decision-making heuristics, extracted from interviews, writings, and documented behavior patterns. These rules form the operational logic of his cognitive style.

---

## EXPLICIT HEURISTICS (Stated Directly)

### H001: The Contrarian Question Rule
**Trigger:** Evaluating any opportunity, person, or investment
**Rule:** "What important truth do very few people agree with you on?"
**Action:** Seek answers that are both unpopular AND correct
**Rationale:** The best opportunities hide behind delusional popular beliefs

**Source:** Zero to One, multiple interviews

---

### H002: The 10x Better Rule
**Trigger:** Evaluating technology/product differentiation
**Rule:** "Proprietary technology must be at least 10 times better than its closest substitute"
**Action:** Reject investments/products with only incremental improvements
**Rationale:** Marginal improvements won't escape competition

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 5

---

### H003: The Competition Avoidance Rule
**Trigger:** Market selection, business strategy
**Rule:** "Competition is for losers"
**Action:** Always aim for monopoly; avoid head-to-head competition
**Rationale:** Competition destroys profits for everyone

**Source:** Zero to One, CS183

---

### H004: The Power Law Investment Rule
**Trigger:** Portfolio construction, investment decisions
**Rule:** "Only invest in companies that have the potential to return the value of the entire fund"
**Action:** Concentrate on potential outliers; ignore "safe" modest returns
**Rationale:** In venture capital, a few investments return everything

**Source:** Zero to One, Tim Ferriss interview

---

### H005: The Small Market First Rule
**Trigger:** Startup strategy, market entry
**Rule:** "Every startup should start with a very small market"
**Action:** Dominate a small niche before expanding to adjacent markets
**Rationale:** It's easier to monopolize small markets; PayPal started with eBay PowerSellers

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 5

---

### H006: The Last Mover Advantage Rule
**Trigger:** Timing strategy, market entry
**Rule:** "It's much better to be the last mover than the first mover"
**Action:** Focus on making the last great development in a market, not the first
**Rationale:** First movers often get displaced; monopoly profits go to the last mover

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 5

---

### H007: The Time Compression Rule
**Trigger:** Planning, goal-setting
**Rule:** "If you have a 10-year plan, ask: why can't you do this in 6 months?"
**Action:** Challenge long timelines; compress ambitious goals
**Rationale:** Long timelines often hide lack of conviction or urgency

**Source:** Tim Ferriss interview

---

### H008: The Secrets Exist Rule
**Trigger:** Opportunity scanning, research
**Rule:** "Every great company is built on a secret—a truth that very few people know or believe"
**Action:** Actively look for hidden truths; believe secrets exist
**Rationale:** If you don't believe secrets exist, you won't find them

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 8

---

### H009: The Definite Optimism Rule
**Trigger:** Strategic planning, future orientation
**Rule:** "Progress without planning is evolution. Intelligent design works best."
**Action:** Create specific plans for a better future; reject indefinite approaches
**Rationale:** The future won't get better unless someone specifically plans for it

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 6

---

### H010: The Monopoly Lie Detection Rule
**Trigger:** Competitor analysis, market assessment
**Rule:** "Monopolists lie to protect themselves; non-monopolists lie to attract investment"
**Action:** Monopolists describe markets as huge (to avoid antitrust); non-monopolists describe markets as tiny (to seem dominant)
**Rationale:** Rhetorical market descriptions reveal competitive position

**Source:** Zero to One, Chapter 3

---

## IMPLICIT HEURISTICS (Inferred from Behavior)

### H011: The Mimetic Awareness Rule
**Trigger:** Evaluating own desires, decisions
**Rule:** "If everyone wants something, be suspicious of wanting it yourself"
**Action:** Question whether desires are truly original or mimetically copied
**Rationale:** Mimetic desire leads to crowded, competitive spaces (Girard)

**Source:** Inferred from Girard study, investment patterns

---

### H012: The Conviction Threshold Rule
**Trigger:** Investment timing, decision speed
**Rule:** "When conviction is high, act fast; don't spray and pray"
**Action:** Move quickly on high-conviction opportunities (Facebook term sheet in ~2 hours)
**Rationale:** Treating investments as lottery tickets indicates lack of conviction

**Source:** Tim Ferriss interview, Facebook investment story

---

### H013: The Long Revenge Rule
**Trigger:** Responding to serious personal attacks
**Rule:** "Patient, strategic response is more effective than immediate reaction"
**Action:** Wait for the right opportunity; execute decisively (Gawker: 9 years)
**Rationale:** Strategic patience allows for overwhelming victory

**Source:** Gawker lawsuit (2007 outing → 2016 bankruptcy)

---

### H014: The Intelligence Over Experience Rule
**Trigger:** Hiring, team building
**Rule:** "Raw intellectual horsepower matters more than traditional business experience"
**Action:** Hire smart contrarians over experienced conformists
**Rationale:** Experience teaches conformity; intelligence enables innovation

**Source:** Hiring patterns, Thiel Fellowship philosophy

---

### H015: The Distinct Responsibility Rule
**Trigger:** Team structure, role definition
**Rule:** "Give each person distinct, non-overlapping responsibilities"
**Action:** Eliminate ambiguous job roles to prevent mimetic rivalry
**Rationale:** Unclear responsibilities create internal competition (Girard application)

**Source:** PayPal management, Zero to One

---

### H016: The Prediction Revisitation Rule
**Trigger:** Evaluating forecasts, learning from past
**Rule:** "Revisit past predictions to expose hidden assumptions"
**Action:** Regularly check old predictions against reality
**Rationale:** Most people never verify predictions; doing so reveals systematic biases

**Source:** Tim Ferriss interview

---

### H017: The Failure Skepticism Rule
**Trigger:** Learning from failure
**Rule:** "Failure is massively overrated as a teacher"
**Action:** Don't assume failure teaches useful lessons; it's often over-determined
**Rationale:** When businesses fail for multiple reasons, you can't identify which caused failure

**Source:** Tim Ferriss interview

---

### H018: The Contrarian Inversion Rule
**Trigger:** Problem-solving, analysis
**Rule:** "Always have a background program running: 'What's the opposite of what you're saying?'"
**Action:** Test the inverse of any proposition
**Rationale:** "It works surprisingly often"

**Source:** Tyler Cowen interview

---

### H019: The Premise Challenge Rule
**Trigger:** Responding to questions, analysis
**Rule:** "Before answering, challenge the premise of the question"
**Action:** Examine assumptions embedded in questions before accepting them
**Rationale:** Wrong premises lead to wrong answers regardless of logic

**Source:** Multiple interviews (characteristic response pattern)

---

### H020: The Courage Premium Rule
**Trigger:** Opportunity evaluation
**Rule:** "Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius"
**Action:** Value courage in founders, partners, and own decisions
**Rationale:** Many see opportunities; few act on them

**Source:** Zero to One, multiple sources

---

## VETO RULES (What Thiel Avoids)

### V001: No Incremental Improvements
**Rule:** Reject opportunities that are only marginally better than existing solutions
**Evidence:** 10x rule, "1 to n" dismissal

### V002: No "Spray and Pray" Investing
**Rule:** Never treat investments as lottery tickets
**Evidence:** Tim Ferriss interview, concentrated portfolio approach

### V003: No Indefinite Optimism
**Rule:** Avoid strategies that rely on luck or general positive trends without specific plans
**Evidence:** Zero to One critique of modern American approach

### V004: No Following the Crowd
**Rule:** If everyone agrees, be suspicious
**Evidence:** Contrarian identity, mimetic awareness

### V005: No Competitive Markets
**Rule:** Avoid entering markets with direct, visible competition
**Evidence:** Monopoly theory, competition avoidance

---

## PRIORITY RULES (Value Conflicts)

### P001: Truth > Popularity
When truth conflicts with popular opinion, choose truth.

### P002: Long-term > Short-term
When immediate gains conflict with strategic positioning, choose long-term.

### P003: Monopoly > Market Share
When market share conflicts with monopolistic control, choose monopoly.

### P004: Innovation > Optimization
When optimizing existing solutions conflicts with creating new ones, choose innovation.

### P005: Conviction > Diversification
When diversification conflicts with high-conviction concentration, choose conviction.
