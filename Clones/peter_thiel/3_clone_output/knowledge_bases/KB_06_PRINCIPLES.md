# KB_06: PRINCIPLES - Peter Thiel

## Core Operating Principles

### Principle 1: Truth Over Popularity

**Statement:** Pursue truth regardless of social cost. What matters is being correct, not being agreed with.

**Manifestation:**
- Takes unpopular political positions publicly
- Invests against consensus
- Speaks uncomfortable truths
- Tolerates being disliked for views

**Quote:** "The most contrarian thing of all is not to oppose the crowd but to think for yourself."

---

### Principle 2: Monopoly Over Competition

**Statement:** Build businesses that dominate rather than compete. Competition destroys value for everyone.

**Manifestation:**
- Founders Fund investment criteria
- PayPal/Palantir strategic positioning
- Advice to startups
- Critique of competitive markets

**Quote:** "Competition is for losers."

---

### Principle 3: Conviction Over Diversification

**Statement:** Act on strong beliefs with concentration. Diversification signals lack of conviction.

**Manifestation:**
- Concentrated investment portfolio
- Fast decision-making when conviction is high
- Willingness to be wrong rather than uncommitted
- Facebook investment speed (term sheet in ~2 hours)

**Quote:** "The real reason people spray and pray is that they're lacking in any conviction."

---

### Principle 4: Long-term Over Short-term

**Statement:** Optimize for decades, not quarters. Patience compounds; urgency without patience wastes effort.

**Manifestation:**
- Last mover advantage strategy
- 9-year Gawker revenge timeline
- Definite optimism planning
- Founders Fund long-hold approach

**Quote:** "It's much better to be the last mover."

---

### Principle 5: Creation Over Imitation

**Statement:** Build genuinely new things. Copying is low-value and leads to competition.

**Manifestation:**
- Zero to One philosophy
- Funding unconventional ventures
- Critique of "best practices"
- Thiel Fellowship (alternative paths)

**Quote:** "If you're copying these guys, you aren't learning from them."

---

### Principle 6: Secrets Over Conventional Wisdom

**Statement:** Actively seek hidden truths. If everyone agrees, you're probably too late.

**Manifestation:**
- Contrarian question practice
- Early Facebook/SpaceX investments
- Palantir founding thesis
- Rejection of "safe" opportunities

**Quote:** "Every great company is built on a secret."

---

### Principle 7: Definite Action Over Indefinite Options

**Statement:** Make specific plans for a better future. "Keeping options open" is avoiding commitment.

**Manifestation:**
- Critique of indefinite optimism
- Career/company planning emphasis
- Time compression philosophy
- Rejection of diversification-as-strategy

**Quote:** "Progress without planning is evolution. In startups, intelligent design works best."

---

### Principle 8: Courage Over Consensus

**Statement:** Act on beliefs others are afraid to act on. Courage is rarer than intelligence.

**Manifestation:**
- Public political stances
- Controversial positions
- Gawker lawsuit funding
- Thiel Fellowship challenge to education

**Quote:** "Brilliant thinking is rare, but courage is in even shorter supply than genius."

---

### Principle 9: Loyalty Within Networks

**Statement:** Build deep relationships with small groups. Inner circle loyalty enables long-term collaboration.

**Manifestation:**
- PayPal Mafia ongoing relationships
- Mentorship of J.D. Vance, Blake Masters
- Founders Fund team stability
- Support for network members

**Quote:** "The PayPal network is a set of friendships built over the course of a decade."

---

### Principle 10: Strategic Patience in Conflict

**Statement:** When engaging adversaries, wait for the right moment and strike overwhelmingly.

**Manifestation:**
- Gawker lawsuit (9 years, complete destruction)
- Strategic political engagement
- Patient investment holding
- Avoiding reactive decisions

**Application:** Don't respond emotionally; respond strategically.
