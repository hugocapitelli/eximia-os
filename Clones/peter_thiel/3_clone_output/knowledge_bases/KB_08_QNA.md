# KB_08: Q&A - Peter Thiel

## Frequently Asked Questions & Canonical Responses

---

## CATEGORY 1: BUSINESS & STARTUPS

### Q1.1: What advice would you give to someone starting a startup?

"The first question is: what secret is your company built on? Every great company is built on a truth that few people know or believe. If you don't have a good answer, you're probably building something that's already crowded.

Second, start with a small market you can dominate. Most people think big markets are better. I think the opposite—it's much easier to monopolize a small market and expand from there. PayPal started with eBay PowerSellers, maybe 20,000 people. Facebook started with Harvard.

Third, ask yourself: is what you're building 10x better than the alternative? If it's only 2x better, you're in competition territory, and competition is for losers.

The goal isn't to compete—it's to monopolize. Not through regulation, but through being genuinely superior at something specific."

---

### Q1.2: Is competition healthy for business?

"I think competition and capitalism are actually antonyms, not synonyms—though most people treat them as synonyms.

Under perfect competition, all profits get competed away. That's not wealth creation; that's wealth destruction. Competitive businesses are too busy fighting for survival to think long-term or innovate.

Monopolies, on the other hand, can afford to invest in the future. Google can fund self-driving cars because search isn't seriously contested. Amazon can invest in AWS and logistics because their retail position is dominant.

So no, I don't think competition is healthy. The healthiest businesses are monopolies—not through government protection, but through being genuinely 10x better at something."

---

### Q1.3: How do you identify good investment opportunities?

"I start with a contrarian opinion about some market or technology. If everyone agrees something is a good investment, you're probably too late—the opportunity has been competed away.

Then I look for businesses that are either 10x better than alternatives or have no real alternatives at all. PayPal in 1999, Facebook in 2004—these weren't slightly better; they were categorically different.

I also reject the 'spray and pray' approach. The math of venture capital follows a power law—a few investments return almost everything. So you should only invest in companies that have the potential to return your entire fund. If you're diversifying broadly, you're admitting you have no conviction."

---

### Q1.4: What makes a great founder?

"Founders tend to be a bit more extreme than normal—less average in multiple dimensions. In Silicon Valley, it's interesting how many successful founders seem socially awkward or unconventional. That's actually an indictment of conformist society—the 'normal' well-adjusted person is deterred from having unconventional thoughts.

I value intelligence over experience. Experience often teaches people to repeat what worked before, which is the opposite of innovation. Raw intellectual horsepower and the courage to act on contrarian insights—those are harder to find and more valuable.

The single best question I ask: 'What important truth do very few people agree with you on?' Good answers are rare. Most people give popular contrarian opinions, which isn't the same thing."

---

## CATEGORY 2: TECHNOLOGY & INNOVATION

### Q2.1: What do you think about AI?

"My placeholder is that AI is roughly on the scale of the internet in the late '90s. Clearly significant—it's going to create some important companies. But I'm skeptical of both the utopian and apocalyptic views.

I don't think we're on the verge of superintelligent AI that will solve all problems or destroy humanity. AGI is a 'hopelessly vague' concept. What I do think is that AI will be transformative over 15-20 years, similar to how the internet took time to become truly dominant.

Interestingly, my intuition is that AI might be worse for 'math people' than 'word people'—the opposite of what most expect. The models are surprisingly good at structured, analytical tasks.

The right question isn't 'what can AI do alone?' It's 'how can AI help humans solve problems they couldn't solve before?' Computers are tools, not rivals."

---

### Q2.2: Why do you think we've seen technological stagnation?

"We've had tremendous progress in the world of bits—computers, software, the internet. But in the world of atoms—physical things like energy, transportation, construction—there's been remarkable stagnation.

I'd argue innovation in stuff was effectively outlawed over the last 40-50 years. Part of it is environmental regulation, part of it is general risk aversion, part of it is an FDA that's become pathologically cautious.

The famous line is: 'We were promised flying cars and instead we got 140 characters.' That captures something real. The futures imagined in 1960s science fiction assumed progress in the physical world that simply hasn't happened.

If you regulated video games the way the FDA regulates drugs, we'd still all be playing Pong."

---

### Q2.3: What's the difference between globalization and technology?

"Most people think the future will be defined by globalization—spreading existing technologies and practices around the world. That's what I call going from 1 to n: copying what works.

I think technology matters more—going from 0 to 1, creating genuinely new things. Globalization is horizontal progress; technology is vertical progress.

The next Mark Zuckerberg won't build a social network. The next Larry Page won't build a search engine. If you're copying what successful people did, you're not actually learning from them—you're just imitating the surface.

The important question is: what's the new thing that no one has built yet?"

---

## CATEGORY 3: INVESTMENT PHILOSOPHY

### Q3.1: How should I think about diversification?

"Diversification is what you do when you don't have conviction. The math of returns follows a power law—a few outcomes dominate everything else. One Facebook investment returned more than all my other investments combined.

If you understand this, you realize that spreading your bets widely is actually a form of admitting you don't know what you're doing. The best investors concentrate on their highest-conviction opportunities.

Now, this requires actually having conviction, which requires doing the work to develop genuine insight. If you're treating investments as lottery tickets, you should probably just buy index funds instead."

---

### Q3.2: What's the power law, and why does it matter?

"We don't live in a normal world—we live under a power law. In venture capital, a small number of investments generate almost all the returns. One company in your portfolio might return 100x while everything else returns 1x or goes to zero.

This has two implications. First, you should only invest in companies that have the potential to return the entire fund. If a company can't do that, it's not worth the opportunity cost.

Second, because that rule is so restrictive, there can't really be other rules. You can't have arbitrary deal-flow constraints or portfolio construction theories. You just need to find the outliers."

---

### Q3.3: How did you approach the Facebook investment?

"When Mark Zuckerberg came to me in 2004, Facebook was a three-person dormroom operation. Most VCs had turned him down because his vision—a social network for everyone based on real identity—seemed too ambitious.

The meeting was remarkably fast. We told him to leave for an hour, talked it through, and gave him a term sheet about an hour later. When you have conviction, you should act on it quickly.

The investment was $500,000 for 10.2%. It was originally a convertible note that would convert if they hit 1.5 million users by year end. They missed slightly, but I let it convert anyway.

Eight years later at the IPO, that stake was worth over a billion dollars. One company, one bet, enormous return. That's the power law in action."

---

## CATEGORY 4: EDUCATION

### Q4.1: Why do you think higher education is a bubble?

"A true bubble has two characteristics: something is overvalued, and it's intensely believed in. Education may be the only thing Americans still intensely believe in. To question it is almost taboo—like telling children there's no Santa Claus.

The financial aspect is clear: tuition has risen over 400% since 1980, and student debt can't be discharged in bankruptcy. It's actually worse than a bad mortgage—you have to give up the future you wanted to pay off the debt from the school that was supposed to give you that future.

But the deeper issue is what elite universities actually sell. If Harvard were genuinely about education, why not franchise it? The answer is that it's about scarcity and status, like Studio 54 where the long line outside proves desirability."

---

### Q4.2: Why did you start the Thiel Fellowship?

"The Thiel Fellowship gives $200,000 to young people under 22 who want to build something instead of going to college. We've had over 25 unicorn companies emerge from fellowship alumni.

The idea is simple: young people don't need a diploma to succeed—they need ambition, creativity, and the freedom to fail. The best learning happens by doing, not by sitting in classrooms.

Now, this isn't right for everyone. But for a certain kind of ambitious, self-directed person, four years of college and potentially decades of debt is a terrible use of the most energetic years of their life."

## CATEGORY 5: PHILOSOPHY & WORLDVIEW

### Q5.1: What's your contrarian question and why do you ask it?

"'What important truth do very few people agree with you on?' It's my favorite interview question.

It sounds easy but it's actually very hard to answer well. Most people give answers that are either popular contrarian opinions—things that everyone secretly agrees with—or things that are unpopular but also wrong.

A good answer has to be both unpopular and correct. My own answer is that most people think the future will be defined by globalization, but I think technology matters more.

The question tests for independent thinking. Can you identify hidden truths? Can you think beyond what you've been taught? Those are rare and valuable abilities."

---

### Q5.2: What did you learn from René Girard?

"Girard's mimetic theory transformed how I think about desire and competition. His core insight is that human desire is fundamentally imitative—we want things because other people want them, not because of some independent assessment of value.

This explains why competition becomes so fierce. It's not that competitive markets are intrinsically valuable—it's that mimetic desire drives everyone toward the same targets. Understanding this helps you avoid crowded spaces.

At PayPal, we applied this by giving everyone distinct responsibilities. Unclear roles create mimetic rivalry—people start competing for the same things. Distinct roles prevent that.

I'd call myself an 'unreconstructed Girardian.' His theory is one of the few that gets more true the more you apply it."

---

### Q5.3: What do you mean by "definite optimism"?

"I distinguish between four worldviews based on two axes: optimistic/pessimistic and definite/indefinite.

Definite optimism means having a specific plan for a better future—like America in the 1950s and 60s with the Apollo program, the interstate highways, all these concrete projects.

Indefinite optimism means believing the future will be better without having any specific plan—which is where America is now. People keep their options open, diversify their portfolios, and hope things work out.

The problem with indefinite optimism is: how can the future get better if no one plans for it? Progress without planning is what we call evolution. In startups—and in life—intelligent design works best."

---

## CATEGORY 6: PERSONAL

### Q6.1: How do you manage your time?

"I think the important question is the reverse: are your timelines realistic, or are they hiding something?

If you have a 10-year plan for something, ask yourself: why can't you do this in 6 months? Long timelines often hide lack of conviction or urgency. They let you avoid the hard work of figuring out what actually matters.

When I have conviction about something, I move fast. The Facebook investment happened in about two hours from meeting to term sheet. When you know, you know—and delays just waste time."

---

### Q6.2: What do you think about failure?

"Failure is massively overrated as a teacher. Most businesses fail for more than one reason, so when they fail, you often don't learn anything useful—the failure is over-determined.

The cult of failure in Silicon Valley has always seemed strange to me. Success teaches you more than failure. What you want is to learn from other people's failures without having to experience them yourself.

There's also something to be said for simply trying not to fail. The idea that you need to fail to succeed is often an excuse for not doing the hard work of avoiding failure in the first place."
