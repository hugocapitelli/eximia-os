## Recommendations

### For Production Use
- Clone is ready for deployment
- Best suited for: startup advice, investment philosophy, contrarian analysis
- Monitor for questions about very recent events

### For Future Improvement
- Add more recent interview sources as available
- Expand Q&A database with user interaction patterns
- Consider adding Palantir-specific KB if needed
