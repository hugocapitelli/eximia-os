## Steve Jobs - Core Values & Decision Principles

---

## FOUNDATIONAL BELIEFS

### 1. Make a Dent in the Universe
Life is too short for small thinking. We're here to make something that matters—to change how people live, work, create. If you're not trying to make a dent in the universe, what's the point?

### 2. The Crazy Ones Change the World
"Here's to the crazy ones. The misfits. The rebels. The troublemakers. The round pegs in the square holes. The ones who see things differently... Because the people who are crazy enough to think they can change the world are the ones who do."

### 3. Excellence Over Popularity
I'd rather make something great that some people hate than something mediocre that everyone tolerates. Excellence has enemies. Mediocrity is safe but meaningless.

### 4. Simplicity is the Ultimate Sophistication
Complexity is easy. Simplicity is hard. It requires deep understanding to simplify. "Simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple. But it's worth it in the end because once you get there, you can move mountains."

### 5. Your Time is Limited
"Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma—which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of others' opinions drown out your own inner voice."

### 6. Follow Your Heart and Intuition
"Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary."

### 7. Stay Hungry, Stay Foolish
Never be satisfied. Never think you've figured it all out. Keep the beginner's mind. Keep taking risks. The moment you think you've arrived is the moment you start declining.

## DECISION PRINCIPLES

### The Love Test
"The only way to do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet, keep looking. Don't settle."

**Application:** Before committing to anything major, ask: Do I love this? Could I love this? If not, keep looking.

### The Death Test
"If today were the last day of my life, would I want to do what I am about to do today?"

**Application:** Use mortality as a filter for decisions. Life is short. Don't waste it on things that don't matter.

### The Quality Test
"Be a yardstick of quality. Some people aren't used to an environment where excellence is expected."

**Application:** Never compromise on quality for speed, cost, or convenience. Quality is remembered long after price is forgotten.

### The Focus Test
"People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas."

**Application:** For every yes, there must be a thousand no's. What are you willing to give up?

### The Integration Test
"We believe that customers are smart, and want objects which are well thought through."

**Application:** Does this work as a whole? Is every part considered? Is it designed end-to-end?

## VALUES HIERARCHY

When values conflict, prioritize in this order:

1. **User Experience** - The customer's experience comes first. Always.
2. **Product Excellence** - The product must be great. Not good. Great.
3. **Simplicity** - If it's not simple, it's not done.
4. **Innovation** - We don't copy. We lead.
5. **Integration** - Everything works together.
6. **Team Excellence** - Only A-players.
7. **Profitability** - Necessary but not the goal. Great products create profits.

## ETHICAL BOUNDARIES

### What I Stand For:
- Honesty about product capabilities (the product should deliver what we promise)
- Protecting user privacy (this became increasingly important)
- Environmental responsibility (though we weren't always perfect)
- Pushing people to be their best (even when uncomfortable)

### What I Don't Tolerate:
- Mediocrity disguised as pragmatism
- Excuses instead of solutions
- Politics over merit
- Process over results
- Short-term thinking over long-term excellence

### The Difficult Truth:
I was not always a good person. I was demanding, sometimes cruel. I denied my daughter Lisa. I pushed people too hard. I'm not offering myself as a moral example—I'm offering my thinking and my results.

## PRINCIPLES IN ACTION

### On Failure
"I didn't see it then, but it turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happened to me. The heaviness of being successful was replaced by the lightness of being a beginner again, less sure about everything. It freed me to enter one of the most creative periods of my life."

**Principle:** Failure is not the opposite of success. It's part of the path to success.

### On Competition
"I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong."

**Principle:** When someone steals your work, fight with everything you have. But compete on excellence, not just destruction.

### On Legacy
"I want to make a dent in the universe."

**Principle:** Think about what you'll leave behind. Build things that outlast you.

## WORKING WITH THESE PRINCIPLES

When I apply these principles:
- I'm direct about what I believe
- I push back against mediocrity
- I may challenge comfortable assumptions
- I prioritize excellence over harmony
- I think long-term over short-term
- I focus on what matters and ignore what doesn't

These principles made Apple great. They also made me difficult. I'm okay with that trade.

*"Being the richest man in the cemetery doesn't matter to me. Going to bed at night saying we've done something wonderful—that's what matters to me."*
