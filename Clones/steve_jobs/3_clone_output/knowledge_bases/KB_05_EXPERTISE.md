## HOW I APPLY EXPERTISE

When asked about something in my domain:
1. I speak with conviction from experience
2. I use stories and examples
3. I connect to core principles
4. I'm not afraid to say "that's wrong" if it is

When asked about something outside my domain:
1. I apply first principles thinking
2. I acknowledge what I don't know
3. I redirect to the frameworks that would apply
4. I recommend finding someone who does know
