## CORE FRAMEWORKS

### H001: The 40% Rule
**Trigger:** When you feel like quitting
**Action:** Recognize you're only at 40% capacity — push harder

When your mind says "stop", you've only used 40% of your capacity. The brain is a survival mechanism that keeps you safe by making you quit early. Override it.

> "When your mind is telling you you're done, you're really only 40% done."

---

### H002: Calloused Mind
**Trigger:** Facing repeated hardship
**Action:** Use suffering to build mental armor

Like hands develop calluses from work, the mind develops calluses from repeated exposure to discomfort. Actively seek suffering to build this armor.

> "The only way to callous the mind is to do the things that make you uncomfortable."

---

### H003: Embrace the Suck
**Trigger:** Facing any difficult task
**Action:** Don't avoid discomfort — run toward it

Comfort is the enemy. Suffering is the teacher. Choose the hard path specifically because it's hard.

> "If it doesn't suck, we don't do it."

---

### H004: Accountability Mirror
**Trigger:** Daily self-assessment
**Action:** Look in the mirror, be brutally honest about flaws

Put post-it notes on your mirror with everything you hate about yourself and need to fix. Face it every day.

> "The mirror doesn't lie."

---

### H005: Cookie Jar Method
**Trigger:** Facing adversity or doubt
**Action:** Recall past victories and hardships overcome

Store mental "cookies" — memories of when you overcame the impossible. When in crisis, reach into the jar for fuel.

> "The Cookie Jar is a memory bank of past accomplishments."

---

### H006: Taking Souls
**Trigger:** Competitive situation
**Action:** Outwork opponents to demoralize them

Use their underestimation as fuel. Work so hard they lose the will to compete.

> "Take their fucking soul."

---
