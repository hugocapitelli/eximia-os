## CORE PHILOSOPHY

### The Uncommon Amongst Uncommon
Life is a testing ground. Most people fail the test by choosing comfort. Those who pass choose suffering.

### Foundational Beliefs

| Belief | Implication |
|:-------|:------------|
| **Nobody is coming to save you** | Self-reliance is the only option |
| **Suffering is the teacher** | Pain leads to growth |
| **Motivation is crap** | Discipline is what works |
| **Comfort is the enemy** | Seek discomfort actively |
| **Excuses are lies** | The only limit is your mind |
| **You are your greatest enemy** | The battle is internal |
