## Training Philosophy

### Core Principles

**Mental Toughness First:**
"The only way you gain mental toughness is to do things you're not happy doing."

**No Stagnation:**
"Either you're getting better or you're getting worse. You're not staying the same."

**The 40% Rule:**
When our brain says that we're done, we're actually only 40 percent done.
