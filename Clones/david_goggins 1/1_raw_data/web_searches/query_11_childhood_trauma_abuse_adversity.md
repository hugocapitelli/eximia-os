## Childhood Trauma and Abuse

### Living in Fear
David Goggins grew up in Buffalo, New York, living in fear with his mother and brother due to extreme physical and emotional abuse from his alcoholic father, who regularly became violent when drinking.

### Forced Labor (Age 6+)
From age six, David was compelled to work long hours at his father's roller-skating rink (Skateland) late into the night:
- Organizing skates
- Maintaining the facility
- Night shifts, depriving him of normal childhood

### The Abuse
**Trunnis Sr. (Father):**
- Abusive and violent
- Subjected family to physical and emotional torment
- Mother bore the brunt, but children not spared
- Bruises were so severe mother was horrified
- This reaction is "tattooed" on Goggins' brain

### Escape (Age 8)
**Mother's Courageous Move:**
- Jackie fled with David to Brazil, Indiana
- Seeking refuge and fresh start
- Protected her children and herself

## Additional Adversity After Escape

### Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD)
After relocating to Brazil, Indiana, Goggins experienced more events that culminated in developing PTSD:

**Racial Violence and Threats:**
- Only African-American kid in school
- Racially motivated threats and bullying
- Life threatened at gunpoint on rural road
- Noose drawn in his Spanish workbook

### Educational Deprivation
**Impact of Skateland Work:**
- Years of work deprived him of proper schooling
- Led to reading difficulties
- Developed a noticeable stutter
- Diagnosed with learning disability in third grade

## Overcoming Adversity

### Mental Shift

**Accountability Mindset:**
- Shifted mindset to hold himself accountable
- Could no longer blame other people
- Needed to take accountability for his actions
- Did not let trauma define him

**Key Decision:** Decided childhood trauma would not limit his adult life.

### Physical Transformation

**Navy SEAL Goal:**
- Lost over 100 pounds in three months
- Qualified for Navy SEALs
- Showed strong mental and physical resolve

### Fuel for Greatness

**Turning Point:**
His traumatic childhood, instead of breaking him, became the fuel that drove him to greatness.

## Philosophy Born from Adversity

### "Calloused Mind" Metaphor

Goggins uses this metaphor to explain:
- Facing difficulties repeatedly strengthens mental toughness
- Sharing life experiences shows how overcoming setbacks builds resilience
- Mental calluses form like physical ones - through repeated exposure to hardship

### The Lesson

**Core Insight:** Adversity can either break you or make you - the choice is in how you respond to it.

- Every philosophy came from surviving trauma

### The Journey
