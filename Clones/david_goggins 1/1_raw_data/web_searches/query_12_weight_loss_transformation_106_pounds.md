### Activities
- Daily long-distance runs
- Cycling
- Swimming
- Intense calisthenics

### Duration
Trained continuously throughout the day to maximize calorie burn given the extremely low caloric intake.

## Mental Approach

### Mind Over Body

**Quote:**
"When you're physically tired, your mind is trying to quit. But it's the mind that will keep you going."

### Transformation Type

**Not Just Physical:**
This wasn't just a transformation of the body—it was a mental breakthrough.

**Mental Discipline:**
- Fighting constant hunger
- Overcoming exhaustion
- Pushing through mental barriers
- Using 40% rule to continue

## Critical Medical Warning

### Health Risks

### Not Recommended

This approach is:
