## Core Success Principles

### 1. The 40% Rule

**Principle:**
When you think you've hit your limit, you're only using about 40% of your capability.

**Application:**
- Most people give up at first sign of discomfort
- True growth happens when you push past that 40% point
- Mind tells you you're done, but body has 60% more to give

**Why It Works:**
Mind quits before body - mental barriers are usually false limits.

### 2. Mental Toughness

**Core Belief:**
The mind is the most powerful tool we possess.

**Application:**

- Achieve greatness through mental strength

**Practice:**
- Daily mental challenges
- Confronting fears
- Intentional discomfort
- Building mental calluses

Evidence-based confidence - you've done hard things before, you can do them again.
