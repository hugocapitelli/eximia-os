## Cookie Jar Technique

### Overview

A mental tool that involves drawing on past successes and achievements stored in one's 'Cookie Jar' to overcome current challenges, reinforcing self-belief and resilience in tough times.

### The Metaphor

Goggins applied this as a metaphor to help himself get through tough times:
- Drew from a mental cookie jar of his accomplishments
- When times were tough, used past victories to motivate himself to keep going

### How to Create Your Cookie Jar

**Step 1: Inventory Your Wins**
Write out all your achievements:
- Life obstacles you've overcome
- Minor tasks you failed at initially
- Tasks you tried again (2nd or 3rd time)
- Tasks you ultimately succeeded at

**Step 2: Store Them Mentally**
Create mental "cookies" - vivid memories of these victories

**Step 3: Access When Needed**
During difficult moments:
- Reach into your Cookie Jar
- Pull out a relevant "cookie"
- Remember: "I've done hard things before"
- Use that energy to push through current challenge

### Purpose

**Reinforces:**
- Self-belief
- Resilience
- Evidence-based confidence

**Provides:**
- Proof of capability
- Momentum during difficulty
- Mental fuel to keep going
