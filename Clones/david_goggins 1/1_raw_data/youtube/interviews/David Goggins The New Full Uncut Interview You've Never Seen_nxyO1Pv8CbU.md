## Transcrição

[Applause] 
 Thank  you. 
 >> All  right. 
 Who's  going  to  carry  the  boats? 
 [Applause] 
 >> All right.  So,  do  you  know  why  I  demand 
 that?  Not  for  me.  When  I  come  out  to 
 every  single  audience,  which  you  guys 
 are  one  of  the  best  ever. 
 [Applause] 
 The  reason  why  I  demand  that  from  the 
 audience  is  because  I  know  what  darkness 
 looks  like. 
 >> I  know  what  it  feels  like  to  be  alone 
 with  no  motivation,  no  drive,  no 
 passion. 
 And  what  has  to  come  out  of  your  [ __ ] 
 soul  in  the  darkest  of  times  is  what  you 
 just  did  right  there. 
 So  that's  what  I  do. 
 So  people  always  like  for  the  first 
 20ome  years  of  my  life  it  was  just 
 darkness.  But  if  you  are  able  to  get  up 
 every  morning  have  no  passion,  no  drive, 
 no  motivation,  no  [ __ ]  and  still  get  up 
 with  that  kind  of  fire.  You  will  be 
 successful  in  life.  I  guarantee  you 
 that. 
 >> That  was  okay. 
 >> That  was  okay. 
 >> It  was  okay.  It  wasn't  great,  but  it  was 
 okay.  One  of  the  best  is  not  the  best, 
 but  we  trying.  I  know.  I  know.  All 
 right.  Well,  first  of  all,  thank  you. 
 Thanks  for  being  here.  Thanks  for  being 
 who  you  are.  Seriously.  And  thanks  for 
 just  being  straight.  No  [ __ ] 
 >> Appreciate  it. 
 >> Because,  and  I  was  saying  this,  Dave, 
 backstage.  We've  been  doing  this 
 together  for  10  years  now.  Some  of  you 
 been  here  for  10  days.  So,  you've  been 
 here  for  three  years,  10  years.  And  I've 
 probably  in  10  years  said,  "This  book 
 changed  my  life."  Not  many.  I'll  be 
 honest  with  you.  Um,  the  only  one  I  read 
 every  day  is  the  Bible  and  I  read  but 
 but  I  if  you've  not  read  and  I'll  read 
 them  all  now  and  I  ain't  bullshitting 
 either  because  when  I  started  reading  it 
 hurt  me 
 it  honestly  it  really  it  really  really 
 screwed  me  up  because  I  started  feeling 
 the  pain 
 >> right 
 >> and  it  was  like  it  was  hurting  me  more 
 because  the  whole  title  is  it  can't  hurt 
 me.  We  have  all  these  amazing  people  out 
 here,  dude.  And  they're  they're  they're 
 great  human  beings, 
 but  it  is  whatever  it  is  in  their  life 
 is  hurting  them.  Whatever  it  happens  to 
 be,  they  eat  what  they  kill  here.  That's 
 it.  Everybody  you  see  out  here, 
 commission  based  sales.  Every  one  of 
 them.  You  seen  a  bunch  up  on  stage 
 killing  it.  They're  great.  But  there's 
 some  right  now,  David,  that  are  trying 
 to  figure  out  what  to  do  tomorrow,  next 
 week,  month.  There's  people  out  here 
 right  now.  They  ain't  going  to  raise 
 their  hands  because  you're  here.  They're 
 excited,  but  they're  thinking  about 
 quitting.  they're  thinking  about  it. 
 What  would  you  say  to  just  about  that 
 mindset  and  what  it  takes  to  do  what 
 we're  doing?  Because  the  pain  is  what  I 
 hear  about,  man.  And  you  you  you  ain't 
 nobody  talks  about  that  better  than  you. 
 >> Well,  the  f  Well,  first  of  all,  what  you 
 guys  got  to  understand,  guys  and  gals 
 understand  is  that  I  keep  it  real.  I'm 
 not  super  human.  I'm  definitely  not 
 Superman.  So  when  I  talk  to  you  all, 
 understand  these  are  the  things  that  I 
 had  to  tell  myself.  So  you  know,  a  lot 
 of  people  come  up  here  and  start  talking 
 to  you  and  they  think  they  have  all  the 
 damn  answers  and  [ __ ]  and  they  kind  of 
 talk  down  on  people.  No,  no,  no.  I  know 
 exactly  what  it  feels  like  to  be  lost, 
 to  want  to  quit  every  day  of  your  life. 
 And  that's  kind  of  what  created  me.  So 
 on  my  bad  days, 
 that's  where  all  this  taking  souls  and 
 [ __ ]  comes  from.  So  on  my  bad  days,  I 
 had  to  imagine  a  false  reality.  So  for 
 me,  for  instance,  I  was  300  pounds.  A 
 lot  of  you  guys  know  my  backstory. 
 And  a  black  kid  there.  I  was  the  only  36 
 Africanamean  Navy  Seal  in  over  80  years. 
 So  think  about  this  though.  Think  about 
 how  I  wanted  to  quit.  I  was  afraid  of 
 the  water. 
 My  favorite  meal  was  chocolate 
 milkshakes  with  chocolate  donuts. 
 I  didn't  run  and  I  was  afraid  of  the 
 water  and  I  was  300  lb.  And  I  have  a 
 pipe  dream  of  going  to  go  be  a  Navy 
 Seal. 
 Yeah,  exactly.  You  should  be  laughing. 
 Every  morning  I  woke  up  and  I  had  less 
 than  three  months  to  lose  106  pounds  to 
 get  into  the  Navy. 
 Every  morning  I  woke  up,  I  wanted  to 
 quit. 
 During  runs,  I  quit.  During  my  diet,  I 
 quit  during  swims.  I  quit.  I  quit  every 
 single  day  during  this  two  and  a  half 
 month. 
 But  the  end  of the  day,  what  kept  me 
 going  was  I  saw  a  video  of  18  men 
 graduating  from  Navy  Seals  training. 
 And  all  I  thought  about  was, 
 what  if 
 what  if  my  black  ass  can  be  up  there  on 
 that  [ __ ]  stage  one  day  and  I  can 
 pull  off  this  [ __ ]  miracle  that  no 
 one  saw.  There  were  no  [ __ ]  social 
 media.  There  were  no  watch  David 
 Gogggins  lose  106  pounds  in  two  and  a 
 half  months.  There  was  no,  you  know, 
 diet  plan  and  [ __ ]  I  No,  there  was 
 nothing.  No  one  saw  it.  My  mom,  she's 
 here  in  the  audience  right  now. 
 [Applause] 
 [Music] 
 She  saw  it  and  she's  the  only  one  that 
 saw  the  transformation. 
 But  I  knew  it.  I  saw  it.  The  whole 
 accountability  mirror  that  I  talk  about 
 and  can't  hurt  me.  Every  morning  I  woke 
 up,  I  had  a  real  conversation  with  that 
 dirty  mirror.  And  every  day  the  same 
 answer  came  back  to  me.  Do  you  want  to 
 be  on  your  deathbed  knowing  that  you 
 could,  but  you  didn't? 
 And  so  every  day  I  kept  saying  that.  I 
 kept  saying  that.  And  before  I  knew  it, 
 two  and  a  half  months  later,  I  lost  the 
 weight  and  I  was  going  to  Navy  steel 
 training. 
 [Applause] 
 >> So, 
 which 
 it  sounds  so  [ __ ]  crazy  that  you're 
 afraid  of  water. 
 >> Terrified. 
 >> Terrified  of  water.  and  decided,  [ __ ] 
 it,  I'm  going to  join  the  Seals.  That's 
 a  good  idea.  The  the  guy  you  talked 
 about  in  your  book,  right?  Because  you 
 were  trying  to  figure  out  what  to  do. 
 You  had  that  whole  like  medical  issue, 
 right?  And  then  you  went  back.  What  did 
 that  guy  see  in  you?  What  did  cuz  that 
 guy,  right,  that  one  was  the  one  like 
 here's  what  you  got  to  do.  Here's  like 
 he  didn't  he  he  saw  something.  What  did 
 he  see  in  you  at  that  time  that  you 
 didn't  see? 
 >> I  don't  know  if  he  saw  anything. 
 >> Okay. 
 >> Basically,  what  he  was  doing  for  me  was 
 doing  his  job. 
 >> Got  it.  no  one  else.  So,  when  I  walked 
 up  to  every  recruiter,  and  there  was  a 
 lot  of  them,  and  I  would  always  go  back 
 to  my  mom's  house  like  upset,  but  every 
 recruiter  saw  what  they  saw.  And  that's 
 the  thing  you  guys  got  to  get  from  me 
 right  now.  A  lot  of  people  see  what  they 
 see.  Maybe  you're  out  of  shape.  Maybe 
 you  look  lazy,  maybe  look  slovenly, 
 maybe  the  maybe  your  outward  appearance 
 is  not  what  it  should  be.  No  one  saw 
 what  was  inside  of  me. 
 And  that's  the  one  thing  I  was  afraid  to 
 pull  this  out  because  who  I  was,  I  was 
 afraid  kid,  but  something  always  said, 
 "Man,  you  got  more  in  you."  And  what 
 this  guy  did  was  just  did  his  job. 
 >> He  looked  at  me.  I  said, "I  want  to  be  a 
 SEAL."  He  goes,  "You  got  to  do  this, 
 this,  this,  and  this."  Every  other 
 recruiter  was  like,  "You're  300  [ __ ] 
 pounds,  bro. 
 Like,  you  walking  into  my  office  with  a 
 chocolate  milkshake." 
 So,  I  don't  blame  them  because  what  they 
 saw,  I  would  have  said  the  same  [ __ ] 
 But  this  one  recruiter,  Stephen  Saljo,  I 
 walked  in,  he  goes,  "I'm  going  to  do  my 
 job.  I  don't  think  this  kid's  going  to 
 make  it.  There's  no  way,  but  I'm  going 
 to  do  my  job."  And  just  by  him  giving  me 
 an  opportunity, 
 I  gave  the  guy  a  lot  of  money  a  couple 
 years  ago.  And  he's  like,  "What?  What's 
 this  for?  This  is  like  literally  20ome 
 years  ago.  I  find  Steve  and  Salio  again 
 and  I  gave  him  money.  He  goes,  "What  the 
 hell  you  give  me  money  for?"  I  go, 
 "Because  you  did  your  [ __ ]  job." 
 And  if  you  didn't  do  your  job,  I  would 
 never  have  found  David  Gogggins. 
 >> Wow. 
 >> So,  I  gave  him  a  [ __ ]  check  for  doing 
 his  [ __ ]  job. 
 >> Damn. 
 >> And  that's  all  he  did. 
 >> Well,  I  I  got  to  be  honest  with  you, 
 David,  before  you  got  here.  And  by  the 
 way,  your  mom's  amazing,  but  she's  like 
 watching  you.  You're  in  the  room.  You're 
 like,  they  watching  mother  effing 
 everything  that's  going  on.  She  looking 
 over  here.  I  look  at  David.  She  looking 
 at  David.  I'm  like,  hell,  if  this  goes 
 bad,  I  don't  stand  a  damn  chance.  She 
 >> She's  got  some  essay,  man. 
 >> Yo, 
 >> she's  got  some  essay 
 >> for  real.  So,  my  man  brought  in  he  had  a 
 And  this  it  gets  to  a  question.  It's 
 real  important  from  accountability 
 standpoint.  So,  my  man  brought  in  a  a  a 
 plate  of  cookies,  15  sugar  cookies.  And 
 I  looked  I  didn't  say  nothing.  He  said, 
 "Oh  [ __ ]  I  got  to  get  rid  of the 
 cookies,  right?  David's  coming.  So,  he 
 got  rid  of  the  cookies.  And  I  said, 
 >> "Dude,  why  are  you  more  worried  about 
 David  seeing  the  cookies  than  you  eating 
 the  cookies, 
 >> right?" 
 >> Like,  what's  you  probably  ain't  going  to 
 see  David  again  after  today  except  for 
 on  YouTube.  Like,  what's  he  going  to  do 
 to  you? 
 >> How  do  people  cuz  that  happens  to  you. 
 It's  got  to  people  around  you  like, 
 "Dude,  I  was  just  I  thought  I  was 
 supposed  to  start  warming  up."  He  went 
 back.  He  about  nine  miles  back  there.  I 
 said,  "Where'd  he  go?"  He  goes,  "Keeps 
 walking  around."  He  stood  still.  Not  at 
 all.  And  I'm  I'm  walking  around.  I  don't 
 even  know  why  I'm  walking  around  cuz  I 
 feel  bad  about  myself. 
 How  do  we  get  people  to  be  more 
 accountable  to  themselves  than  they  are 
 everybody  else  who  actually  doesn't  even 
 matter?  They're  not  even  a  stakeholder 
 in  their  life.  That  was  the  one  thing 
 that  I  was  trapped  in.  So,  a  lot  of 
 people  don't  know  this  story  about  me, 
 but  when  I  was  coming  up,  so  I  went  to 
 all  white  school  for  a  while  and  then  I 
 went  to  a  majority  black  school  for  a 
 short  period  of  time.  And  I  went  to 
 majority  black  school.  See,  I  always 
 wanted  to  be  after,  so  I  wanted  to  be  a 
 priest  first.  No  one  knows  that.  And 
 then  after  that,  I'm  like,  I  want  to  go 
 be  in  special  operations. 
 Like  I  said,  there's  only  36 
 African-Americans.  So,  you  don't  walk 
 around  a  black  community  talking  about, 
 I  want  to  go  be  in  special  operations. 
 So, 
 I  tried  to  fit  in. 
 And  by  me  trying  to  fit  in  with  every 
 group  I  was  in,  I  lost  myself. 
 And  so  why  I'm  so  polarizing  now  is 
 because  either  you  [ __ ]  like  me  or 
 you  [ __ ]  don't. 
 And 
 the  reason  why  I  was  walking  so  much 
 backstage, 
 I'm  nervous  as  [ __ ]  to  be  out  here  in 
 front  of  these  people. 
 Yeah.  For  real. 
 >> My  mom  would  tell  you  a  story.  When  I 
 was  in  elementary  school,  we  moved  from 
 my  dad's  place  where  I  got  my  ass  beat. 
 I  had  a  lot  of  toxic  stress. 
 Hair  was  falling  out  of  my  head.  I  had  a 
 bunch  of  white  splotches.  And  the 
 biggest  thing  was  I  stuttered  like  a 
 [ __ ] 
 >> Bad.  It's  funny  now.  This  [ __ ]  wasn't 
 funny  when  you  were  a  [ __ ]  kid. 
 So, 
 every  time  I  get  on  stage,  I  think  about 
 one  thing.  We  had  a  Christmas  play  and  I 
 was  in 
 maybe 
 second,  third  grade,  whatever  it  was. 
 Didn't  matter.  I  was  young,  but  I 
 stuttered  horribly  bad. 
 And  I'll  never  forget,  the  teacher  gave 
 me  the  smallest  line  possible  because 
 she  knew  this  could  be  a  [ __ ]  train 
 wreck.  He  may  get  up  there  and  just  act 
 a  fool. 
 So,  I  got  up  there  and  I  acted  a  fool 
 and  I  just  walked  off  [ __ ]  stage.  I 
 couldn't  say  the  I  couldn't  say  [ __ ]  I 
 just  went  up  there  and  just  started  just 
 doing  my  [ __ ]  Just  started  break 
 dancing  at  the  mouth. 
 So,  I  walk  off  and  every  time  I  get  on 
 stage,  I  have  to  overcome 
 that  one  feeling  of  looking  out  the 
 audience  and  everybody  and  saying,  "Oh 
 shit."  cuz  I  didn't  cuss  when  I  said  in 
 my  mind  there  was  no  cuss  words  up  there 
 but  I  says  so  what  happens  is  you  have 
 to  gain  this  confidence  because  you  lose 
 yourself  because  you're  always  trying  to 
 hide  from  the  stuttering  or  you're 
 trying  to  hide  from  I  wasn't  that  smart 
 so  I  hid  there  I  hid  because  I  was  only 
 black  person  I  hid  because  I  wanted  to 
 be  espec  I  was  constantly  hiding  from 
 these  groups  of  people  because  I  wanted 
 to  be  accepted 
 and  the  more  I  hid  the  more  David  Gagans 
 became  nothing.  There  was  no  David 
 Gogggins.  I  was  you  when  I  was  around 
 you.  I  was  Mary  around  Mary.  I  was  John 
 around  John.  There  was  no  David 
 Gogggins.  And  along  this  journey  when  I 
 started  losing  weight  and  I  had  so  many 
 bad  days  in  my  life,  so  many  bad  days 
 from  growing  up  even  now. 
 Well,  nobody  [ __ ]  there  but  David 
 Gogggins. 
 God  was  there, 
 >> but  God  said,  "Hey,  [ __ ]  I'm 
 testing  you  today  and  I'm  gonna  test  you 
 tomorrow.  I'm  gonna  test  you  again.  I'm 
 gonna  let  you  I'm  gonna  let  you  alone, 
 man.  Pray  all  the  [ __ ]  you  want. 
 Pray.  Get  on  your  knees,  boy.  Pray. 
 I'm  going  still  kick  your  ass." 
 >> So,  the  more  I  realized  this  is  my 
 journey  and  the  more  I  realized  where's 
 all  my  friends? 
 They  ain't  [ __ ]  nowhere  around.  It 
 was  you.  So,  you  better  figure  out  who 
 the  [ __ ]  you  are  on  this  journey.  And 
 those  few  people  who  don't  many  people 
 don't  like  you,  so  be  it.  But  you  first 
 have  to  figure  out  you  because  a  lot  of 
 people  die  with  a  lot  of  untapped 
 potential  because  they're  trying  to  be 
 somebody  that  they're  not. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> So,  I  was  able  to  figure  out  my  own 
 potential  by  figuring  out  me. 
 Dude,  I  was  really  prepared  for  you  to 
 be  hardcore  as  [ __ ]  but  you're  [ __ ] 
 funny.  Like  really  funny.  I  didn't  know 
 that.  Like  really  funny. 
 And  I  want  to  get  to  because  I  was 
 watching  something  you  posted  the  other 
 day  which  I  think  was  great  because  what 
 a  lot  of  the  men  and  women  in  here  are 
 work  with  David  is,  you  know,  we  call 
 people  up  and  sell  them  life  insurance. 
 And  most  of the  people  tend  to  get  a 
 pretty  good  grasp  on  that,  right? 
 Everybody's  going  to  die.  You  need  life 
 insurance.  You  asked  for  it.  Most  people 
 get  pretty  good  grasp  on  that  and  and 
 are  able  to  monetize  it,  make  a  living, 
 and  then  they  have  a  choice  to  build  a 
 business  and  actually  help  other  people. 
 And  I  actually  didn't  start  hiring 
 people  because  I  thought  about  spread.  I 
 had  friends  that  had  no  job.  They're 
 broke.  And  I'm  like,  "Yo,  you  should  do 
 this."  They're  like, "Why?"  I'm  like, 
 "It's  easy."  Like,  that  was  how  I 
 started  building  a  business.  But  a  lot 
 of  the  men  and  women  we  have  here  are 
 paralyzed.  They  want  to  talk  about  it. 
 They  want  to  post.  They  want  to  talk  to 
 their  friends,  their  family.  They  want 
 to  post  something  on  social  media,  but 
 they're  truly  terrified.  If  we  could 
 polygraph  everybody  in  here,  80%  of  them 
 would  blow  up.  when  we  said,  "Are  you 
 worried  about  what  people  think  if  you 
 post  and  try  to  recruit?"  And  you'd  post 
 something  recently  about  how  many  people 
 don't  even  follow  you.  Like,  I  didn't 
 know  that  [ __ ]  Like,  they  don't  even 
 follow  you,  but  they  go  on  to  comment. 
 Like,  they  don't  follow  you. 
 >> 23  million  nonfollowers. 
 >> 23  million  people  go  on  to  talk  [ __ ] 
 Don't  even  follow  you.  They  won't  follow 
 you.  They  don't  want  to  see  your 
 content,  but  then  they  seek  it  out,  see 
 it,  and  then  talk  about  it.  How  do  you 
 help  everybody  here  truly?  Because  I 
 suck  it  a  lot,  but  I'm  like  a  lot.  And 
 I'm  like,  dude,  I  really  just  don't  care 
 what  anybody  thinks  at  all.  Like,  if  I 
 come  up  here  and  do  this  interview  and 
 and  and  they're  like,  "That  was 
 terrible."  If  you're  like, "Dude,  that 
 was  awful."  I'm  like, "Dude,  I  gave  it 
 everything  I  got."  Like,  I'm  I  did  the 
 best  I  could  and  try  to  screw  it  up  and 
 give  me  feedback.  I'll  get  better.  How 
 do  we  empower  everybody  in  here?  How  do 
 you  empower  everybody  in  here  to  just 
 truly  proceed,  do  whatever  the  hell  they 
 want  with  their  business,  ask  everybody 
 they  run  into,  there's  hundreds  of 
 millions  of  people  in  America.  We  do. 
 We're  we're  we're  for  our  business. 
 We're  a  good  big  company,  right?  But 
 none  of  that  matters.  We  could  be  10 
 times  the  size  and  still  have  too  many 
 people  out  there  with  no  life  insurance. 
 How  do  we  get  these  men  and  women  to 
 recruit  people  and  not  give  a  [ __ ]  what 
 anybody  thinks  or  says  about  them?  So,  I 
 have  a  question  for  you  all,  but  only 
 one  person  can  answer  it. 
 What  is  your  biggest  fear? 
 Why  are  you  paralyzed?  What  what  makes 
 you  nervous  to  just  go  out  there  and 
 just  be  who  you  are  and  do  what  you  have 
 to  do?  I  want  to  see  one  hand  raise  up 
 to  answer  this  question.  You  in  the 
 front,  what  is  it? 
 >> Past  experience. 
 >> So  what?  So  failures.  Okay,  that's  the 
 perfect  answer.  And  we  did  not  set  this 
 up. 
 So  everybody  asked  me  how  the  hell  did  I 
 become  successful  when  abused  mindset, 
 toxic  stress,  couldn't  read  and  write, 
 fat, 
 name  it,  sickle  cell.  I  I  can't  even  be 
 in  the  military  nowadays  with  cickle 
 cell.  How  the  hell  did  I  become 
 successful  when  I  had  no  passion,  no 
 drive,  no  nothing?  And  I'm  going  answer 
 your  question  about  what  are  you  afraid 
 of,  right? 
 You  thought  and  you  said  failure. 
 Everybody's  afraid  of  failure.  It's 
 embarrassing  as  [ __ ]  So  how  do  you 
 think  I  became  successful  when  I  failed 
 every  day  of  my  life  until  I  succeeded, 
 which  took  a  long  time? 
 The  first  thing  I  did  was  I  All  of  you 
 in  this  room  want  to  be  successful  as 
 hell.  But  the  journey  to  success  comes 
 with  a  lot  of  what? 
 >> Failure. 
 So  why  the  [ __ ]  don't  you  teach  yourself 
 like  I  taught  myself 
 is  how  to  fail 
 properly. 
 It's  not  saying  be  a  failure.  When  I  was 
 300  lb  people  think,  oh,  you  really 
 thought  you  could  be  a  Navy  Seal?  No.  I 
 think  I  was  going  to  [ __ ]  lose  the 
 weight.  But  what  it  was  was  how  I  was 
 able  to  get  over  all  the  failure  and  all 
 the  embarrassment  of  failing  was  I  told 
 myself, 
 you  are  going  to  have  to  learn  how  to 
 get  up  extremely  fast  because  you  are 
 going  to  have  a  million  setbacks  on  this 
 journey.  And  that's  how  I  literally 
 taught  myself  how  to  fail  first.  Because 
 I  knew  that  if  I  was  afraid  of  failure, 
 I  would  have  never  been  able  to  be  a 
 Navy  Seal.  I  would  have  never  been  able 
 to  get  to  where  I'm  at  today.  So,  I  went 
 through  and  I  literally  at  300  lbs  or 
 297  to  be  exact.  I  sat  back  and  I 
 visualized  how  this  journey  is  going  to 
 look  in  the  first  several  months  was 
 nothing  but  failure.  So,  how  am  I  going 
 to  get  up  the  next  morning  when  I  failed 
 the  day  before?  How  am  I  gonna  eat  this 
 meal  when  I  failed  and  I  got  fries  and  a 
 milkshake  again  when  I  was  supposed  to 
 get  grilled  chicken  and  rice?  So,  I  went 
 through  and  I  taught  myself  how  to  fail. 
 And  when  you  do  that,  you're  able  to  get 
 up  extremely  fast  and  you  no  longer  care 
 about  the  end  result  because  you  know  if 
 I  want  to  be  way  up  here,  it's  going  to 
 take  a  bunch  of  small  micro  failures 
 along  the  way.  But  you  have  to 
 understand  that  that  is  part  of  the 
 process.  When  you  want  to  achieve  the 
 highest  goal  of  all  time, 
 you  are  going  to  have  to  learn  how  to 
 get  your  ass  kicked  all  the  way  up  that 
 damn  mountain.  And  then  when  you  get  up 
 the  mountain,  the  oxygen  up  there  is 
 very  thin.  It's  hard  to  breathe.  So  it's 
 not  a  lot  of  fun  up  there  either. 
 So  all  the  way,  if  you  want  to  be 
 successful,  you  got  the  bottom  that 
 sucks.  The  middle  is  extremely  hard  and 
 the  top  it  sucks  worse  than  all  of  it. 
 So  you  better  learn  how  to  get  the 
 auction  at  the  very  top.  So  why  do  you 
 care  about  what  people  are  thinking  when 
 they're  not  trying  to  go  where  the  [ __ ] 
 you're  trying  to  go?  And  that's  the 
 whole  moral  of  the  story. 
 So,  we  have  in  our  business,  it's  not  a 
 typical  sales  deal,  right?  Like  when  I 
 was  in  real  estate,  if  I  didn't  sell  you 
 a  house,  I  didn't  sell  you  a  house.  You 
 had  a  place  to  live.  You  know,  if  I 
 didn't  sell  you  I  stole  construction 
 material,  if  you're  in  solar  and  don't 
 sell  somebody  solar,  it's  all  good.  In 
 our  business,  if  we  don't  make  a  sale, 
 somebody  dies  with  zero  life  insurance 
 or  not  enough.  That's  that's  honestly  no 
 [ __ ]  I  was  social  worker  14  years, 
 found  this.  I  was  like,  "Dude,  this  is 
 social  work,  but  I  get  paid  more  and 
 then  I  can  bring  people  on."  If  these 
 all  these  men  and  women  work  with  you 
 and  and  you  could  get  them  to  because 
 that's  what  I  try  to  get  to  and  I  and 
 I'm  I  need  to  get  a  million  times  better 
 at  it  cuz  I'm  actually  people  are  like, 
 "How'd  you  sell  a  lot?"  I  didn't  want  to 
 leave  anybody  unprotected  and  [ __ ]  if  I 
 had  to  piss  them  off,  upset  them,  make 
 them  uncomfortable,  make  them  give  me 
 [ __ ]  make  them  judge  me,  make  whatever 
 I  had  to  do,  I  wanted  them.  And  and  when 
 I  got  my  first  death  claim,  three  months 
 in,  32-y  old  dude  died  in  a  motorcycle 
 accident,  got  quarter  million  dollars.  I 
 was  like,  "Oh,  everybody's  getting 
 covered."  How  do  we  h  how  what  what's 
 your  advice?  What  is  your  advice,  David, 
 on  because  I  always  went  to  what's  the 
 worst  thing  that  could  happen?  Well, 
 [ __ ]  I  can  screw  this  family  up  for 
 nobody  came  to  my  mom's  apartment  when 
 my  grandma  died.  We  had  no  life 
 insurance.  Grandpa,  aunts,  uncles, 
 friends.  I  didn't  even  know  what  life 
 insurance  was  until  I  got  to  be  old  and 
 goddamn  life  insurance.  I  didn't  have 
 life  insurance  till  I  got  my  life 
 insurance  license.  How  do  we  get  h 
 what's  your  advice  to  all  of  us,  me 
 included,  on  how  we  approach  that 
 knowing  that  we  can  really  screw  things 
 up  if  we  don't  do  everything  we  can?  We 
 can't  make  everybody  buy  it,  but  hell, 
 we  got  to  give  more.  And  and  in  our 
 deal,  like  you're  here,  clients  over 
 here.  Until  you're  uncomfortable  and 
 they're  uncomfortable,  there's  no 
 freaking  sale.  No  way.  Because  they  sit 
 here,  you  sit  there,  you  give  them  your 
 pitch.  But  you've  got  to  get  them 
 uncomfortable.  What's  your  advice  for  me 
 and  the  rest  of  us  on  getting  people 
 uncomfortable  and  understand  the 
 consequences  of  what  can  happen  if  we 
 don't  do  our  job?  Well,  this  is  the 
 thing.  He  said  uncomfortable  about  three 
 or  four  times.  You  guys  heard  that, 
 right? 
 >> Your  job  is  to  get  people  uncomfortable. 
 It  sucks.  I  work  with  a  guy  one  time 
 that  made  $75,000  a  year  and  his  job  was 
 very  similar  to  yours  and  now  he  makes 
 over  a  million.  He  worked  he  he  called 
 me  up  five  years  ago  and  said,  "I  want 
 you  to  be  my  coach."  And  I  taught  him 
 one  thing.  I  had  him  out  here  doing  all 
 kind  of  crazy  [ __ ]  He  goes,  "Why  are 
 you  doing  this?"  I  go  because  your  main 
 job  is  to  make  people  uncomfortable. 
 But  it's  hard  to  make  someone 
 uncomfortable 
 when  you've  never  been  uncomfortable 
 yourself. 
 So,  a  lot  of  people  in  this  room 
 aren't  pushing  themselves  to  that 
 uncomfortable  place. 
 And  that  is  the  first  thing  you  have. 
 You  have  to  know  what  uncomfortable 
 feels  like.  So  when  you're  pushing 
 someone  to  that  place, 
 you  know  how  to  talk  them  through  it. 
 Because  if  you  haven't  experienced  it 
 and  you  haven't  gotten  the  knowledge 
 from  it,  it  is  impossible  to  push 
 someone  there  because  the  second  they 
 get  uncomfortable,  you  are  now 
 uncomfortable. 
 You  are  now  in  your  feelings.  You  are 
 now  feeling  bad  for  this  person.  You  now 
 feel  that  they're  uncomfortable  because 
 you  don't  know  how  to  walk  them  through 
 the  uncomfort. 
 And  that  is  the  most  important  thing 
 that  you  have  to  learn  is  there  is 
 theorist  and  there's  practitioners. 
 A  lot  of  theorists  will  tell  you  how 
 uncomfortable  feels. 
 The  practitioners  are  the  ones  that  have 
 experienced  uncomfortable  and  they  know 
 exactly  the  steps  on  how  to  get  through 
 being  uncomfortable.  So  then  you  now 
 have  the  science  about  it.  So  while 
 you're  talking  to  this  individual  and 
 they're  feeling  uncomfortable,  you  know 
 exactly  how  to  break  them  down  and  find 
 a  way  in  to  their  heart  so  they  come  out 
 with  the  insurance  that  they  need  in  the 
 long  run. 
 >> It's  amazing. 
 One  of  the  other  things  we  we  struggle  a 
 lot  with  is  and  it  might  be  the  same 
 with  people  that  work  out  competing  is 
 and  I  was  I  was  talking  to  a  guy  earlier 
 this  morning.  I  said,  "What's  your 
 biggest  issue?"  He  said,  "I  found  a  way 
 to  make  money."  And  then  he  said  to  me, 
 "But  I  self-sabotaged."  Which  I  think  is 
 [ __ ]  in  my  opinion.  I  think  that's 
 just  a  madeup.  Like,  it's  awesome  way  to 
 let  people  off  the  hook.  Oh,  you  just 
 didn't  do  No,  dude.  You  didn't  do  the 
 work.  You  didn't  sell.  You  don't  wake  up 
 and  go,  "I'm  going  to  destroy  it.  I'm 
 now  all  of a  sudden  I'm  not 
 accountable."  But  the  struggle  has  been 
 for  a  lot  of  folks  is  I  didn't  want  to 
 be  on  the  hamster  wheel  for  the  next  60 
 years.  When  I  got  my  life  insurance 
 license,  what  scared  me  the  most  was  I 
 was  going  to  people's  houses  that  were 
 75  years  old  and  they  like  were  broke  as 
 all  [ __ ]  and  I'm  like  I  don't  ever  want 
 to  like  outlive  any  money  and  be  able  to 
 not  support  myself. 
 The  complacency  that  sets  in  because  I 
 was  raised  if  we  had  and  again  you  got 
 to  figure  out  what  your  motivator  is. 
 Mine  was  never  money.  It  was  this.  I  I 
 don't  know  that  I  saw  this  or  didn't  see 
 this,  but  I'm  like,  if  these  idiots, 
 because  I  met  them,  if  they  can  run  a 
 company,  and  I've  met  them,  [ __ ]  I  can 
 do  it,  too.  But  a  lot  of  folks  get  here 
 and  and  money's  their  their  their 
 barometer.  I  have  enough  to  live,  so  I'm 
 good.  Maybe  the  gentleman  that  you 
 coach,  maybe  someone  I  have  enough  to 
 live,  so  I'm  good.  What  What's  your 
 advice  on  people  actually  realizing 
 there's  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  and  they'll 
 do  it.  They'll  come  in  here  and  they'll 
 work  60  hours  a  week 
 >> and  then  40  hours  a  week  and  then  I  got 
 money.  Then  they  go  on  vacation  for  3 
 weeks, 
 >> right? 
 >> And  then  they  want  to  know  what  the 
 problem  is.  And  in  our  business,  it's  an 
 advanced  business.  So  the  money  can 
 charge  back.  How  do  you  help  us 
 understand  to  keep  freaking  going, 
 especially  when  it  feels  good,  like  it's 
 getting  good.  How  do  we  make  it  great  or 
 not  go  backwards? 
 >> So  a  lot  of  you  will  not  agree  with 
 this,  which  is  fine. 
 So,  don't  take  this  literally  because 
 don't  ever  cap  this, 
 but  I  cap  my  success. 
 I'm  not  saying  cap  your  money.  I'm  not 
 saying  any  of  that.  I  say  this  is  just 
 my  term.  So,  every  single  year,  so  I'm 
 I've  made  millions  of  dollars, 
 very  well  off.  I  don't  need  to  work  ever 
 again.  But  every  year  I  go  to  British 
 Columbia  and  I  jump  out  of  airplanes  and 
 I'm  a  smoke  jumper 
 and  I  lose  about  $5  million  a  year 
 to  smoke  jump  for  four  to  five  months  a 
 year.  Everybody  goes,  "Why  the  hell  do 
 you  do  that?" 
 Because  on  my  journey  trying  to  get  to 
 where  I'm  in  today,  I  found  out  that  all 
 the  knowledge  for  me  came  at  the  bottom. 
 And  how  I  stay  hungry  is  I  literally  go 
 back  to  the  bottom.  I  go  back.  I  pick  up 
 a  shovel.  I  pick  up  a  pilaski.  Someone's 
 in  charge  of  me.  Some  20some  year  old 
 kid.  I'm  damn  near  50  [ __ ]  years  old. 
 I  got  some  20-year-old  kid  still  digging 
 in  his  nose  and  digging  his  ass  in 
 charge  of  me.  But  it  humbles  me  because 
 I  want  to  be  the  best.  And  a  lot  of 
 people  in  here, 
 they  might  just  be  okay 
 with  just  that  money  to  live.  And  that's 
 the  thing  that  I  realized  a  long  time 
 ago  in  my  life  is  there's  some  people  I 
 can't  motivate.  There's  some  people  in 
 this  room  that  when  I  speak,  they're 
 rolling  their  eyes.  This  guy's  [ __ ] 
 David  Gaga  is  ridiculous  [ __ ]  His 
 passion,  his  motivation,  his  drive  is 
 all  [ __ ]  crazy.  It  is  because  I  found 
 out  a  long  time  ago  what  I'm  supposed  to 
 be  in  this  world 
 and  that  hunger  is  going  to  stay  with  me 
 until  I'm  dead. 
 You  have  to  have  that  kind  of  want  in 
 your  life.  If  you're  fine  with  waking  up 
 every  morning  and  having  just  enough  to 
 go  on  vacation  and  come  back  and  you 
 work  again,  that's  good  for  you.  But 
 you're  in  this  room  for  a  [ __ ] 
 reason.  And  a  lot  of  you  in  this  room 
 will  leave  this  conference  and  you  will 
 go  bust  your  ass  and  you'll  be  motivated 
 as  hell  because  you  heard  somebody  speak 
 and  the  fire  is  built  up.  But  guess  what 
 happens  four  months  from  now? 
 There's  a  trend  in  every  single  in  every 
 single  job.  They  have  a  conference, 
 they're  kicking  ass,  they're  kicking 
 ass,  they're  kicking  ass,  and  then  it's 
 like,  "Ah,  [ __ ]  I  don't  have  any  more 
 motivation, 
 man.  And  I  was  making  I  was  killing  it 
 last  four  months.  What  the  [ __ ] 
 happened?  This  conference  took  you  and 
 elevated  you  to  the  next  [ __ ]  level. 
 But  then  the  real  you  came  out.  The  real 
 you  might  be  unmotivated. 
 Might  have  no  determination,  no  passion, 
 no  drive. 
 But  like  I  said,  why  the  [ __ ]  did  I  have 
 you  all  yell  at  the  top  of  your  lungs 
 when  I  came  out? 
 Because  on  those  dark  days,  you  still 
 have  to  find  more.  And  if  and  if  you 
 don't  want  to  find  more  for  yourself, 
 look  to  your  left  and  look  to  your 
 right.  If  you  got  a  mom,  a  dad,  a  wife, 
 a  husband,  kids, 
 make  sure  you  may  be  fine  with  that 
 little  bit  of  money  you  have  and  you're 
 good. 
 Try  to  make  generational  [ __ ]  wealth. 
 >> Amen. 
 If  you're  good, 
 be  that  person  when  a  [ __ ]  fire 
 happens  in  the  room  like  this.  I 
 guarantee  most  of you  [ __ ]  will 
 look  at  me.  Where's  Gogggins  going?  I'm 
 going  to  follow  that  [ __ ] 
 You  want  to  be  that  [ __ ]  for 
 your  family  that  when  all  hell  breaks 
 loose,  they  know  that  even  though  you're 
 good  by  yourself,  you  got  a  family  to 
 take  care  of  and  you  have  made  enough 
 for  them  that  they  fall  on  their  [ __ ] 
 ass,  you  can  pick  them  up. 
 So,  there's  a  lot  of  things  out  there 
 that  should  keep  you  going  in  life.  And 
 if  if  that's  not  enough, 
 you  need  to  look  at  that  dirty  mirror 
 again  and  see  why  you're  really  doing  it 
 for. 
 >> Wow. 
 So  when  you  listen  and  I  I'm  10  years 
 I've  been  doing  this  15  10  years.  I've 
 been  doing  the  we  do  these  meetings 
 and  this  the  first  time.  First  of  all, 
 I've  been  sober  23  years,  but  sitting 
 next  Thank  you.  But  sitting  next  to  you 
 is  the  closest  I  felt  to  being  back 
 smoking  crack  and  sniffing  cocaine.  And 
 I'm  gonna  be  I'm  just  being  honest.  I'm 
 not  lying.  I'm  being  honest.  Sorry.  I'm 
 honest.  I  feel  like  we're  getting  ready. 
 I'm  I'm  too  old.  I'm  51.  But  I  feel  like 
 we're  being  ready  to  take  the  football 
 field  and  I  just  played  around  with  an 
 eightball  and  I'm  ready  to  go  and  we're 
 going  to  kill  somebody.  Like  that's  how 
 I  actually  feel.  Which  means  the  shit's 
 contagious.  And  I've  never  met  anybody 
 that  I've  sat  next  to.  I  met  a  lot  of 
 smarter  people,  but  I  ain't  met  nobody 
 had  more  energy  than  me.  And  I'm  like 
 he's  straight  as  [ __ ]  be  sober.  It's 
 contagious. 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> It's  But  and  and  I  love  what  you  said, 
 be  that  for  your  family,  right?  Cuz  when 
 people  come  up  and  go,  "My  dad,  I  was 
 talking  to  Sean,  this  kid,  Sean  Junior." 
 He's  like,  "Uh,  you're  I'm  like, "No, 
 your  dad's  it,  dude.  Like,  your  dad  has 
 his  own  business.  I  ain't  your  dad's 
 boss.  Everybody's  independent.  I  ain't 
 your  dad's  boss.  Your  dad's  a  boss  of 
 your  family." 
 All  these  folks 
 have  to  understand,  and  I  want  you  to 
 speak  to  this,  please.  Everybody  on 
 their  team's  watching  them.  Every 
 freaking  And  by  the  way,  nobody  here  is 
 rolling  their  eyes  talking  [ __ ]  about 
 you.  I  promise  you.  Number  one,  they're 
 scared  you  might  see  them  from  here.  And 
 number  two,  peer  pressure,  the  most 
 powerful  person  in  the  world.  Somebody 
 next  to  you  will  be  like,  "Dude,  stop 
 shaking  your  freaking  head  or  I'll  hit 
 you  and  it'll  keep  spinning  around. 
 Guarantee  it.  Promise  you." 
 Talk  to  us  about  that  because  that's 
 what  kills  me.  I  had  a  guy  tell  me  one 
 day,  he  goes,  "You  know  why  that  guy's 
 team  don't  grow?"  I  go,  "No."  He  goes, 
 "Dumps  his  [ __ ]  downhill.  He  has  a  bad 
 day.  He  dumps  on  everybody  and  he 
 paralyzes  them.  Everybody.  And  I  watch 
 these  people.  Watch  them.  They're 
 watching  their  moves.  They're  feeling 
 their  energy.  Good  or  bad.  I've  been  up 
 here  on  stage  doing  these  things  with 
 people  that  charge  way  too  much  money 
 that  are  uber  famous.  I'd  rather  be 
 shoving  thumbtacks  in  my  eyeball.  It's 
 so  [ __ ]  bad.  Seriously.  Tell  help  us 
 understand. 
 Everybody's  watching.  Everybody.  The 
 thing  about  it  is  you  all  know 
 everybody's  watching  and  this  is  the 
 thing.  So,  have  you  have  have  have  you 
 guys  heard  of  my  thing  called  Taking 
 Souls? 
 >> Yeah. 
 >> Okay.  For  those  of  you  who  haven't,  I'm 
 going  to  give  you  a  short  story.  So, 
 everybody's  watching. 
 And  so,  when  I  started  figuring  out  what 
 I  want  to  be  in  life,  I  want  to  be  a 
 leader.  I  want  to  be  the  leader.  Like  I 
 said,  when  a  fire  breaks  out,  they  look 
 at  you.  And  what  that  means  is  this. 
 It  was  Wednesday  of  my  second  hell  week. 
 We  had  been  up  the  whole  time.  Hadn't 
 got  any  sleep. 
 And  so  there's  about  three  bolt  crews 
 left,  which  means  there's  not  many 
 people  left.  Like  over,  I  don't  know, 
 80,  90  people  are  quit.  We're  down  to 
 just  three  boat  crews.  So  we  go  into  the 
 med  check 
 and  they  go  in,  they  check  us  out. 
 Everybody  is  hypothermic.  Everybody's 
 all  jacked  up.  and  Wednesday 
 you're  a  zombie.  That's  what  the  pass 
 down.  So  the  pass  down  is  through  years 
 they  tell  you  on  Wednesday  you're  a 
 zombie.  You're  walking  around  like  this 
 because  you  don't  want  your  clothes  to 
 touch  you  cuz  you're  soaking  wet.  You 
 got  the  ocean  and  you're  and  you're  just 
 pissing  on  yourself  to  get  warm. 
 So  you  you  like  that,  didn't  you? 
 So 
 basically  what  happens  is  you  go  to 
 medcheek,  they  have  these  a  crates.  The 
 a  crates  have  your  nice  dry  clothes  in 
 them.  But  what  happens  is  the 
 instructors  are  there  [ __ ]  putting 
 water  in  them.  So  those  dry  clothes  are 
 now  [ __ ]  wet.  And  all  the  students 
 are  just  like  poopy  pants.  Like  [ __ ]  I 
 got  to  put  these  [ __ ]  wet  clothes  on. 
 And  they're  putting  them  on  slow  and  the 
 instructors  are  yelling.  But  now  the 
 instructors  know  that  they're  zombies 
 because  that  because  the  instructors 
 were  zombies  on  Wednesday.  So  they're 
 giving  us  a  little  bit  of  leash.  This 
 goes  somewhere.  So  this  work  with  me  for 
 a  second.  So  we  got  three  boats.  Boat 
 crew  one,  boat  crew  2,  and  the  Smurf 
 crew.  The  Smurf  crew  is  has  a  smurf  on 
 the  front  of  the  boat  because  they're 
 the  shortest  guys  in  the  class. 
 Smurf  crew. 
 So  boat  crew  one.  They're  the  tallest 
 guys.  Boat  crew  two,  the  second  tallest 
 guys  and  so  on  and  so  forth.  There's 
 only  three  boat  crews  up  here.  So, 
 everybody  gets  under  their  boat  and 
 they're  standing  there  with  the  boat  on 
 top  of  their  head  and  everybody's  doing 
 this  [ __ ]  To  answer  your  question, 
 I  look  back,  I  am  [ __ ]  up.  My  feet,  my 
 hands,  my  neck,  my  whole  body  is  just 
 messed  up.  And  I'm  looking  at  like 
 everything  slowed  down.  I'm  looking  at 
 all  these  people  under  these  boats  and 
 they're  just  sitting  there  jackhammering 
 and  heads  are  down  and  the  motivation  is 
 gone. 
 And  I  said,  "David,  this  is  exactly 
 where  you  wanted  to.  This  is  your  time. 
 This  is  your  time.  You're  amongst  the 
 baddest  [ __ ]  in  the  world  right 
 now  and  everybody's  [ __ ]  up.  This  is 
 my  internal  dialogue  right  now.  What  are 
 you  going  to  [ __ ]  do,  man?  You  got 
 This  is  your  shot,  man.  Man,  this  is 
 your  [ __ ]  shot.  I'm  in  the  front  of 
 the  boat  crew.  The  front  of  the  boat  is 
 the  heaviest  part  of  the  boat.  I'm 
 looking  at  my  boat  crew  and  they're  all 
 just  [ __ ]  I  want  this  to  end,  but 
 it's  not  going  to  end  till  Friday.  We 
 got  two  more  [ __ ]  days  of  this  [ __ ] 
 So,  I'm  like  in  the  front  of  the  boat. 
 I'm  like,  you  know what,  man?  So,  the 
 instructors  are  at  Boat  Crew  One. 
 They're  saying,  "All  right, 
 [ __ ]  Pick  the  boat  up."  And 
 we've  been  picking  this  boat  up  now 
 forever.  But  now,  for  some  reason,  no 
 one  can  pick  the  [ __ ]  boat  up.  So, 
 here  they  are, 
 and  it's  going  back  to  their  head.  So, 
 I'm  looking  at  my  I  go,  "Okay,  look 
 guys."  So,  I  turn  around,  my  boat  crew, 
 there's  five  guys  behind  me.  I  said, 
 "Look,  [ __ ] 
 Don't  be  a  [ __ ]  punk. 
 I  want  you  to  look  at  these  [ __ ] 
 instructors  because  they  were  where  we 
 were  years  ago  under  these  boats. 
 And  I  want  them  to  think  about  they 
 never  seen  a  bow  crew  like  B  crew  too. 
 We  are  going  to  [ __ ]  take  their 
 [ __ ]  souls  today. 
 So  I  start  to  juice  these  mother  and  so 
 you  get  juiced  up  false  re  false 
 motivation  becomes  what?  Real 
 motivation.  So  now  they're  starting  to 
 feel  the  juice.  So  it  starts  come  by. 
 All  right,  boat  crew  2.  But  right  now, 
 boat  crew  2  has  said,  "Fuck  it.  We're 
 gonna  pick  the  boat  up  before  you  tell 
 us  to  pick  the  boat  up."  So  the  boat's 
 up.  Now  we're  starting  to  boat  press  it. 
 And  all  we're  saying  is  you  can't  hurt 
 boat  crew,  too.  And  now  our  boat  crew 
 puts  the  boat  down.  They  let  us  put  the 
 boat  down  because  we  showed  something 
 that  no  one  else  had.  So  by  us  putting 
 out  more,  we  got  a  chance  to  rest.  So, 
 as  we're  resting,  I  turn  around  the  B 
 crew.  It  says  all  these  [ __ ] 
 instructors,  I  want  to  make  sure  from 
 Wednesday  to  Friday,  they  cannot  sleep 
 with  their  [ __ ]  wives  because  they're 
 thinking  about  brok. 
 [Applause] 
 So  to  answer  your  question,  you  want  to 
 be  that  one  [ __ ] 
 that  every  day,  whether  it's  raining, 
 snowing,  sleeping,  you  lost  every  dime, 
 your  mom  died,  your  dad  died,  you  come 
 and  you  bring  the  energy  that  it  takes 
 to  make  a  team  function  at  the  highest 
 [ __ ]  level  every  day.  And  that's  the 
 person  you  want  to  be  every  day  of  your 
 life. 
 Wow. 
 [Applause] 
 So,  I  didn't  you  you  I  mean  I  I I  was 
 reading  your  biography 
 on  all  the  races  and  I  got  tired  just 
 reading  it.  Then  I  read  it  again.  But  I 
 did  not  know  I  knew  early  that  that 
 mission  and  these  races  runs  you  started 
 that  to  raise  money, 
 >> right? 
 >> Can  you  tell  us  about  that? 
 >> You  want  the  whole  story? 
 >> Sure.  You  do  what  you  want,  bro.  It's 
 your  stage. 
 >> All  right.  So,  basically  how  this  all 
 started  for  me.  A  lot  of  you  may  know 
 the  story,  but  um  after  I  became  a  Navy 
 Seal,  you  guys  lone  survivor. 
 >> Yep.  Well,  Marcus  Latrell  is  one  of  my 
 best  friends  and  so  is  his  twin  brother 
 Morgan  Latril. 
 So,  funny  story  about  Marcus  and  Morgan. 
 It's  actually  in  my  audio  book,  Can't 
 Hurt  Me,  is  that  Morgan  was  not  in  the 
 military.  Marcus  was  in  the  military 
 first.  Long  story  short,  Marcus  couldn't 
 run  for  [ __ ] 
 Morgan  ran  one  of  his  four  mile  time 
 runs.  They  didn't  even  know  it  was  a 
 flop  of  twins  and  passed  it  for  Marcus. 
 Anyway,  little  inside  tip.  So,  what 
 happened  was  Marcus  was  on  a  mission, 
 mission  went  bad,  a  bunch  of  guys  died. 
 I  was  in  three  hell  weeks.  So,  damn  near 
 everybody  on  that  op  I  was  in  hell  week 
 with.  So,  when  I  heard  the  news,  I  was 
 in  military  freef  fall  school  with 
 Marcus's  twin  brother,  Morgan. 
 And  I  got  the  call  telling  me  that  I 
 have  to  tell  Morgan  that  his  that  Marcus 
 was  dead. 
 Marcus  was  not  dead.  They  thought  he  was 
 dead.  So  I  told  Morgan  they  believe  that 
 Marcus  is  dead.  They  can't  find  him. 
 Everybody  else  is  dead.  They  can't  find 
 Marcus.  They  believe  he's  dead.  Morgan 
 looked  at  me  and  said,  "He's  not." 
 I'm  like,  "What  the  [ __ ]  you  talking 
 about,  bro?" 
 He  was  right.  He  wasn't  dead.  Four  days 
 later,  Morgan  calls  me  up.  Hey,  bro. 
 They  found  my  [ __ ]  brother.  Go  suck 
 it.  I  was  like,  "All  right." 
 So,  at  this  time, 
 I  weighed  191  when  I  joined  the 
 military. 
 I  went  to  250  after  I  became  a  Navy 
 Seal. 
 So,  that  story  touched  me  so  much  that  I 
 started  googling  different  races.  I 
 wanted  to  raise  money  for  the  Special 
 Operations  Warrior  Foundation.  It's  a 
 foundation  that  if  your  if  your  dad  was 
 in  the  military,  he's  a  special 
 operator,  he  died,  your  son  or  daughter 
 would  get  full  tuition  to  go  to  college. 
 So,  I'm  like,  I'm  going  to  go  do  this. 
 But  being  a  Navy  Seal,  I  couldn't  do  a 
 hot  dog  or  hamburger  competition,  you 
 know,  do  something  like  that.  But,  so  I 
 looked  up  the  10  hardest  races  in  the 
 world, 
 and  what  came  up  was  the  Bad  Water  135. 
 And  me  not  being  an  ultrar  runner,  my 
 workout  was  literally  I  hit  the  weights 
 every  day  and  Sunday  I  did  the 
 elliptical  trainer  for  20  [ __ ] 
 minutes.  No  cardio,  just  that's  all  I 
 did  for  cardio.  So  I  Googled  this  [ __ ] 
 and  what  came  up  was  the  Bad  Water  135. 
 So  I  called  the  race  director  up  and 
 said,  "Hey  man,  I  want  to  do  this  race 
 to  raise  money  for  this  foundation."  He 
 goes,  "Are  you  an  ultrarunner?"  I  was 
 like,  "What  is  that?"  He's  like,  "You 
 know,  do  you  run  100  mile  races  or  I  go 
 100  mile  races?  I  I  didn't  know  this 
 [ __ ]  even  existed."  So,  long  story 
 short,  he  goes,  "Look,  man,  you  got  to 
 run  a  100  miles  in  24  hours  or  less  to 
 get  into  the  Badwater, 
 and  if  you  can  do  that,  I  will  consider 
 you  in  my  race."  The  application  process 
 ended  in  January.  I  called  the  cat  up  in 
 November  and  he  said,  "Well, 
 if  you  really  want  to  get  in  the  race, 
 there  is  a  race  in  San  Diego  called  the 
 San  Diego  One  Day."  I  call  him  up  on  a 
 Wednesday.  This  race  was  Saturday. 
 I  had  done  no  running.  And  he  goes, 
 "Okay,  check  it  out.  You  get  in  it,  you 
 run  100  miles,  24  hours,  I  can  see  you 
 my  race."  So,  there's  a  onem  track  in 
 San  Diego.  It  was  called  a  San  Diego  One 
 Day.  You  want  to  run  a  onem  track,  see 
 how  far  you  can  get.  So  I  said,  "Fuck 
 it."  I  signed  up  for  the  race.  At  the 
 time  I  was  married.  I  get  I  go  to 
 Walmart,  get  a  blue  lawn  chair.  I  have 
 Rich  Crackers  and  Milelex. 
 That's  what  I  have  for  the  whole  damn 
 race.  So  I  realize  I'm  going  to  see  this 
 chair  every  single  one  mile  loop.  And 
 I'll  get  some  Milelex  and  a  Ritz 
 cracker.  Stupid. 
 I  had  no  idea  the  [ __ ]  I  was  doing.  But 
 I'm  going  to  cut  to  the  chase.  Here  I 
 am.  I  get  to  mile  70 
 and  I  never  ran  past  20  miles  in  my 
 entire  [ __ ]  life.  And  I'm  I'm  in  this 
 chair  at  mile  70.  What  do  you  think 
 happens  to  you  when  you  are  sucking  on  a 
 rich  cracker  ball  because  your  mouth  is 
 dehydrated,  all  [ __ ]  up,  and  you're 
 drinking  Mileplex?  What  do  you  think 
 happens  to  you  at  mile  70  being  that  you 
 never  trained  for  this  and  hadn't  gone 
 that  far  in  your  life?  Your  body  starts 
 to  literally  die  and  break  down.  So  I'm 
 sitting  there  in  this  chair  and  I  have 
 to  go  to  the  bathroom.  Haven't  gone  to 
 the  bathroom  in  12,  13  hours.  The 
 bathroom's  from  me  to  the  damn  wall 
 right  there.  So  I'm  trying  to  get  up  but 
 I  can't  get  up.  My  blood  pressure  is  all 
 messed  up.  And  I  look  over  and  I  look  at 
 my  ex-wife.  I'm  like,  "Hey, 
 I'm  going  to  take  a  [ __ ]  on  myself  right 
 now 
 because  I  can't  get  up  and  my  blood 
 pressure  is  all  [ __ ]  up  and  I'm  dizzy 
 as  shit."  So,  I'm  sitting  there  [ __ ] 
 up  my  back  and  peeing  blood  down  my  leg. 
 I  got  30  [ __ ]  miles  to  go.  And  this 
 is  where  I'm  at  right  now.  And  there's 
 one  thing  a  black  man  never  wants  to 
 [ __ ]  hear.  She  looked  at  me  and  she 
 said,  "You're  starting  to  turn  white. 
 It's  a  [ __ ]  long  day. 
 So,  I'm  sitting  there.  I'm  looking  at 
 her  and  this  is  where  the  40%  rule  came 
 from.  So,  I'm  trying  to  raise  this  money 
 and  I'm  all  jacked  up.  So,  in  life,  you 
 guys  are  going  to  come  to  a  point  in 
 your  life,  maybe  not  quite  this  [ __ ] 
 up,  but  where  you  don't  want  to  go  on 
 anymore. 
 So,  what  I  do  is  I  quit.  I  don't  really 
 quit.  I  let  my  mind  know  that  we're 
 going  to  [ __ ]  bag  it  for  the  day.  70 
 miles  in,  I'm  good.  But  I  didn't  quit 
 yet.  But  I'm  telling  myself  I'm  going  to 
 quit.  I'm  sitting  here  in  this  chair. 
 I'm  like,  "Okay,  I  can't  get  the  [ __ ] 
 up.  I'm  really  messed  up.  I'm  got  [ __ ] 
 everywhere  and  this  is  messed  up."  So, 
 I'm  cleaning  myself  up  and  there's  an 
 aid  station  that  I  haven't  been  using 
 that  has  peanut  butter  and  jelly,  salt 
 tablets,  and  bananas.  Real  food  that  I 
 [ __ ]  need  some  water  and  [ __ ]  right 
 now.  I  need  something.  So,  I  have  my 
 ex-wife  bring  me  over  some  food.  I'm 
 going  to  sit  here  because  I'm  going  to 
 quit  pretty  soon,  but  just  not  yet.  Let 
 me  get  cleaned  up  first.  Let  me  get 
 something  to  eat.  What  this  does  to  your 
 mind  is  it  takes  pressure 
 off  of  your  brain  for  a  second.  30  more 
 [ __ ]  miles  you  don't  want  to  think 
 about  when  you  got  [ __ ]  up  your  back. 
 So,  I'm  sitting  there  and  I'm  eating 
 some  food.  I'm  like,  "Okay,  man.  My 
 blood  pressure  is  a  little  bit  better. 
 I'm  going  to  walk  to  the  car,  but  before 
 I  walk  to  the  car,  it'd  be  pretty  badass 
 if  I  can  walk  one  mile  and  then  I'll 
 quit." 
 I  walked  a  mile. 
 Long  story  short,  that  one  mile  became 
 30  [ __ ]  miles. 
 And  that's  the  thing  that  we  do  a  lot  in 
 life. 
 What  we  do  is  when  we  have  a  goal,  my 
 goal  was  to  raise  money  for  this 
 foundation.  Now,  I'm  not  saying  go  to  my 
 extent.  This  is  all  take  what  I  say  with 
 the  great  just  take  it  take  little  bits 
 of  what  I  say.  You're  not  trying  to  be 
 [ __ ]  David  Gogggins.  You're  trying  to 
 be  the  best  you  possible.  But  that 
 requires  knowing  how  to  take  mental 
 breaks  when  [ __ ]  gets  hard.  It's  not 
 quitting. 
 Just  take  a  [ __ ]  break  for  a  second. 
 Get  your  breath  because  your  mind  is 
 panicked.  You're  sporadic.  It's  called 
 the  one  second  decision.  I  saw  so  many 
 people  who  could  have  graduated  Navy 
 Seal  training,  but  they  get  in  that 
 [ __ ]  cold  water  during  hell  week. 
 Think  about  hell  week.  Hell  week  is  five 
 days,  130  hours  of  continuous  training. 
 You  might  get  two  hours  of  sleep,  but 
 you  go  through  three  to  five  weeks  of 
 training 
 before  you  get  to  hell  week.  So  all  hell 
 week  is  is  no  sleep.  It's  the  same  [ __ ] 
 you  were  doing.  Nothing  different.  But 
 your  mind  spazzes  the  [ __ ]  out  hour  one 
 when  they  put  you  in  that  cold  water 
 that  you've  been  in  a  thousand  times. 
 You  get  in  that  cold  water  and  you  freak 
 out.  You  don't  remember  that  I've  been 
 this  water  before  a  thousand  times.  You 
 don't  remember  I've  done  this  [ __ ] 
 before.  So  in  that  one  second  decision, 
 your  mind  can't  process  130  hours.  It's 
 too  much.  So  you  quit. 
 And  once  you  quit,  you  take  that  warm 
 shower.  And  guess  what  happens?  You  have 
 regret.  So  you  have  to  learn  how  to 
 manage  that  one  second  decision.  And 
 what  that  is  is  this. 
 If  you  do  130  hours, 
 every  second  you  have  to  win.  If  you 
 lose  one  [ __ ]  second  of  that  130 
 hours,  you  will  not  be  a  Navy  Seal. 
 In  life,  it's  the  same  way.  If  you  lose 
 one  second,  not  take  a  break.  If  you 
 make  a  bad  decision  and  just  hang  it  up 
 in  that  one  second,  you  will  [ __ ] 
 regret  it.  You  must  win  every  second. 
 You  must  be  in  control  of  your  life 
 every  second  of  your  life  or  you  will 
 lose.  So  that's  the  biggest  thing.  Never 
 forget  your  goals.  Many  dreams  die  while 
 suffering. 
 Don't  be  one  of  those  people  whose 
 dreams  die  while  you're  suffering.  Learn 
 to  manage  your  mind. 
 Wow.  Unbelievable. 
 All right,  we're  wrapping  up.  I  need 
 your  help  with  something.  We  wrap  up 
 here  after  you.  You  close  it  out.  We 
 have  a  dinner  break.  We  got  an  award 
 ceremony.  We  give  out,  you  know,  we  have 
 5,000  people.  We  probably  got  500  people 
 started  to  get  awards.  They'll  be  here. 
 They're  getting  awards.  The  best  thing 
 that  anybody  ever  did  to  me  when  I  got 
 the  insurance  business,  the  guy  made  me 
 go  to  the  awards  ceremony.  I've  been 
 there  for  four  months.  I  said,  I've  been 
 here  four  months.  He  said,  I  want  you to 
 go  to  the  ceremony.  I  want  you  to  see 
 the  people  get  the  awards  and  I  want  you 
 to  realize  that  if  they  can  do  it,  [ __ ] 
 you  definitely  can  do  it.  I  want  you  to 
 sit  in  your  chair  and  think  of  what  it 
 feel  like  when  you  go  achieve  it.  I  went 
 like  he  told  me  to  and  I  watched  and  I 
 was  like,  the  dude  just  tripped  over  the 
 stairs.  The  dude  went  the  wrong  way.  The 
 number  one  guy  talked  about  himself  for 
 45  minutes  and  a  little  dude,  I'll  never 
 do  that  when  I  take  that  award  next  year 
 because  that  was  really  egotistical. 
 Can  you  help  me  speak  life  into  the 
 people  that  are  thinking  about  going  and 
 getting  dinner,  going  getting  drunk, 
 going  to  watch  a  game,  and  convincing 
 them  that 
 coming  back  here  is  a  great  decision  for 
 their  family. 
 All  right.  There's  a  phrase  I  always 
 say,  and  this  phrase  needs  to  stick  with 
 you  for  the  rest  of  your  life. 
 There's  a  lot  of  people  who  want  to  go 
 back,  watch  the  game,  get  a  drink,  bag 
 it.  They  want  to  bag  the  rest  of  the 
 day. 
 But  the  question  is,  are  you  done  yet? 
 Are  you  truly  finished  with  what  you 
 came  to  do? 
 And  so  my  phrase  that  I've  said  to 
 myself  for  a  lot  of  years,  and  I  say  it 
 in  the  darkest  of  times, 
 don't  stop  when  you're  tired. 
 Stop  when  you're  done.  So  remember  that. 
 Are  you  done?  A  lot  of  you  are  not  done. 
 So  don't  sit  back  and  be  that  bad  team 
 member 
 because  everybody's  watching  you  and 
 everybody's  gonna  know  you  [ __ ] 
 bagged  it.  This  is  all  part  of  being  a 
 [ __ ]  leader.  Being  a  leader  [ __ ] 
 sucks.  You  do  everything  in  life  that 
 you  do  not  want  to  do.  You  are  unhappy 
 90%  of  your  life. 
 But  that  means  that  other  people 
 are  eating  because  of  you.  They're 
 living  because  of  you.  They're  achieving 
 because  of  you.  So,  are  you  really  in 
 that  bad  a  shape?  So,  make  a  decision 
 tonight.  Do  you  want  to  be  a  leader  or 
 do  you  want  to  be  that  person  who  just 
 bags  it  and  does  their  own  [ __ ]  And 
 then  you  can  ask  yourself  that  question 
 when  you  go  home  after  bagging  it.  Look 
 in  that  dirty  mirror  and  ask  yourself 
 one  question.  Do  I  really  have  what  it 
 takes  to  be  a  [ __ ]  leader?  I  answer 
 that  question  for  you.  No.
