[00:11] been my running partner the audio
[00:13] version of it has been my running
[00:14] partner for the last week
[00:16] it's [ __ ] amazing man well i
[00:18] appreciate that thank you well you guys
[00:20] are doing something very unusual the
[00:21] book is great i've read i've read it
[00:23] like sat down red red but the the audio
[00:26] book is really interesting right because
[00:29] you and the gentleman you wrote it with
[00:31] yeah adam adam schonick adam schonick
[00:34] who who reads it then you come on and
[00:37] talk about things in between so it's
[00:39] more than just the book right it's the
[00:41] book plus it's the book plus like a
[00:44] podcast right yeah so how that came to
[00:47] be man is um
[00:48] as i was going through this book for the
[00:49] last year
[00:51] we would go through change stuff up have
[00:52] so many stories man we went through
[00:54] interviews from people so many stories
[00:56] he would come back and read it to me
[00:58] all my changes and when he read i'm like
[01:00] man this guy has a great reading voice i
[01:03] love his reading voice
[01:04] and i started getting these different
[01:06] ideas about doing it like you know what
[01:08] maybe he can read and i can do my
[01:10] podcast thing on the side and he can
[01:12] like after each chapter in between
[01:14] chapters make it real interactive type
[01:16] of thing and that's kind of how it came
[01:17] to be man at the beginning i gotta be
[01:19] honest the beginning i was like who is
[01:20] this [ __ ] talking for david
[01:22] gardens i was gonna call dave like dick
[01:24] you redo this why don't you do it why
[01:26] are you but but it works right it really
[01:28] does work yeah like as as it goes on and
[01:31] i got also
[01:33] it's very obvious that you and him are
[01:35] good friends so when you guys are
[01:37] talking then i don't mind him reading
[01:39] for you as much for some strange reason
[01:40] right i know it doesn't make any sense
[01:42] well i want to say we're good friends
[01:44] i'm i'm just joking adam that you can
[01:45] hear me right now um he became a pain in
[01:47] my [ __ ] ass during this process man
[01:49] because you know he's just uh he's a
[01:51] real anal guy you know he he helped out
[01:54] a lot you know i'm a i'm a real raw
[01:57] sadistic type of mindset and he uh he
[01:59] helped me put that on paper man so i
[02:01] gave him a lot of credit for that well
[02:03] it it comes across the book is
[02:05] outstanding and you know it's it's it's
[02:08] more than just sitting like sitting
[02:10] across you and you telling your story is
[02:13] one thing but this long detailed history
[02:17] of how you became to be the person you
[02:19] became
[02:20] i think it's very educational for people
[02:24] because they can realize like oh he
[02:26] wasn't always this guy
[02:28] right this is what's [ __ ] up about
[02:29] people like you see a guy who's like you
[02:31] who runs i mean how many ultra marathons
[02:33] did you run in a row you read some
[02:34] insane
[02:38] in a row just stop and think about that
[02:40] ladies and gentlemen eight hundreds
[02:41] means eight 100 mile races
[02:46] eight weekends in a row a 100 mile race
[02:48] will put you out for [ __ ] six months
[02:50] right you know when you ran eight of
[02:52] them eight weekends what's the [ __ ] it's
[02:53] a [ __ ] insane accomplishment it was
[02:55] nuts you think about a person like that
[02:57] you think of them as in this like static
[02:59] fully formed version right you don't
[03:01] usually get to see and especially
[03:03] someone like you who you went into so
[03:05] much depth about your rise and fall and
[03:08] rise and fall it wasn't like a straight
[03:10] linear process between you getting
[03:13] inspired and you becoming this bad
[03:14] [ __ ] no it wasn't like um
[03:17] what's that show called um
[03:20] that will smith plays
[03:21] that that black guy who kind of makes it
[03:23] in um in the financial world
[03:26] a pursuit of happiness i never saw that
[03:28] yeah it's a great movie it wasn't like
[03:29] pursuit of happiness man like like with
[03:31] a guy who struggles and he and he gets
[03:33] over it and he makes it yeah i feel on
[03:35] my ass i i thought i got the top mount
[03:37] everest and my neighbors just [ __ ]
[03:39] slide right underneath me man i was like
[03:41] god dawg i start from scratch again
[03:42] scratch became my friend
[03:44] literally man so you know that's that's
[03:47] how you put in the book man just going
[03:48] up going down going up just a real raw
[03:50] version of how my life was and
[03:53] it was so in-depth to go back through
[03:54] your life with the fine-tooth comb
[03:57] that i almost got embarrassed even put
[03:58] it out there to people yeah that's what
[04:00] i understand man like
[04:02] even me right now to talk to you
[04:04] i'm in the car for a [ __ ] hour
[04:05] getting pumped up cause i'm i'm a shy
[04:08] introverted leave me alone type of guy
[04:11] like i'm still that [ __ ] who is
[04:14] six years old you know at a play who
[04:16] can't say his line because i know i'm
[04:18] gonna stutter in front of five people so
[04:20] i walk off the stage that's still me so
[04:22] every day i'm fighting that dude so
[04:24] people think oh my god man you're in a
[04:25] podcast look so crazy so evil no i'm
[04:28] trying to be locked into joe so my mind
[04:31] isn't very off saying let's run out the
[04:33] damn door because people are watching me
[04:35] on the [ __ ] podcast i want to open
[04:38] this damn door and get the hell out of
[04:39] here man
[04:40] so that's the real me so i'm not
[04:43] sadistic man i'm focused on what i have
[04:44] to do to stay locked into the game of
[04:46] life and that's what and that's why i
[04:48] tell people man i i go there i go there
[04:51] that's one of the reasons why this book
[04:52] is so good is because you're so honest
[04:54] about your vulnerabilities and how you
[04:56] overcome them and for people that see
[04:59] someone who's a beast who's done great
[05:01] things you just assume that they're
[05:03] different than you right but then you
[05:04] hear about your insecurities and your
[05:06] pitfalls and all the things that went
[05:08] wrong with you and you realized well god
[05:10] damn it those are the same things that
[05:11] go wrong with me like maybe i have that
[05:13] inside of me and i've just never
[05:15] summoned it right and i'll tell you this
[05:18] i started really realizing that when i
[05:19] started overcoming myself
[05:21] i started getting around these real
[05:22] alpha males these hard hard men
[05:25] and i always put people way above me
[05:28] when i was growing up like my god they
[05:29] had to have a lot more than me to get to
[05:31] where they're at
[05:32] and a lot of them did
[05:34] but once you get around the the best of
[05:38] the best of the best people
[05:40] you can kind of start breaking them down
[05:41] and realizing man you you're just as
[05:42] [ __ ] up as me like we all have but all
[05:45] you did was you hit it better
[05:47] your your your upbringing your mom and
[05:50] dad your society the way you were raised
[05:52] it hit it better than
[05:54] than mine you weren't the only black kid
[05:56] or there was like five in in a school
[05:58] you know i can't hide going through buzz
[06:01] i was only black you can't hide
[06:03] but i started realizing just because i
[06:06] look different than you a lot of you my
[06:07] first cannot either so it started giving
[06:09] me courage to watch some people that
[06:10] were all have a story we all have a
[06:12] jacked up life in one way or another
[06:14] some of us don't have the guts to talk
[06:15] about it though and that's where i found
[06:17] the guts to talk about mine well there's
[06:19] some there's purity in physical pursuits
[06:22] right because it doesn't matter what
[06:23] your social status is it doesn't matter
[06:25] how people perceive you when it when it
[06:27] comes down to how long can you stay in
[06:29] that pool when it comes down to how far
[06:31] can you run when it comes down to how
[06:34] much can you push yourself past the part
[06:36] where you want to quit how far can you
[06:38] keep going there's a purity in that that
[06:40] it did dissolve social order all that
[06:43] [ __ ] all the what people think about
[06:45] you goes out the window it's what who
[06:47] who are you right now that's right who
[06:49] are you right now that's a true
[06:50] statement man and i look at it as
[06:52] a psychological warfare
[06:55] and that's where i started learning that
[06:56] that life is one big psychological
[06:58] warfare that you play on yourself
[07:00] you play on yourself man
[07:02] the most important conversation i ever
[07:04] had with is with myself
[07:06] and the [ __ ] i was telling myself was so
[07:08] [ __ ] up it was so wrong it was so
[07:09] misguided
[07:10] and other people start to write that
[07:12] dialogue for you also
[07:14] it starts to be what you say to yourself
[07:15] every single day and i started creating
[07:18] a whole nother warfare
[07:20] a whole nother battle started becoming i
[07:21] was like oh hang on a second coggins
[07:24] you have these tools
[07:25] do you have these tools your life was
[07:27] basically the perfect
[07:29] the perfect grounds for training for
[07:32] where you need to go in your life all
[07:33] the beatings all the all the bullying
[07:36] all that you know you going through uh
[07:38] learning disabilities all the struggles
[07:39] it was the absolute perfect training
[07:42] ground for you to go to where you need
[07:43] to go and that's how i start looking at
[07:45] my life versus what was me poopy pants
[07:47] kick a rock down the street mentality it
[07:49] was no
[07:50] god just hooked you right the [ __ ] up he
[07:53] hooked you right up man with the perfect
[07:55] place you were training for the first 18
[07:57] 19 20 you were training for this stuff
[07:59] man you have the advantage of everybody
[08:01] else versus
[08:03] my god
[08:04] they're so above me
[08:05] they came from a great family
[08:08] mom and dad loved them they didn't have
[08:09] to learn they didn't start they didn't
[08:11] struggle no man your struggle is what
[08:13] made you who you are now so i started
[08:16] flipping this into a whole different i
[08:18] started being a master of
[08:20] what i was scared of i was scared of my
[08:21] mind
[08:22] and i became a literally a master of
[08:24] that mind and that's what now from now
[08:27] on it sets me apart from most people i
[08:29] start diving into that well that is a
[08:32] big part of the story is when you go
[08:33] over your childhood and you know
[08:36] your abusive father and then having this
[08:39] great guy that was going to become your
[08:40] stepdad and then he gets murdered it's
[08:42] like right when you're about to get out
[08:44] of it everything looks good boom then he
[08:47] gets murdered it's like these things
[08:49] really did sort of set you up to start
[08:51] from scratch again and just go okay
[08:53] roger that we start from scratch and now
[08:55] you have that attitude you developed it
[08:57] through
[08:58] all of these horrible personal
[09:00] experiences all the trials and
[09:02] tribulations all the evil [ __ ] that
[09:04] people try to do to you that sort of set
[09:06] you up to be able to deal in a way that
[09:09] a lot of people can't
[09:10] well
[09:11] i used to look at my life from a
[09:12] different vantage point
[09:14] and when you're when you're in all the
[09:16] muck and you're just walking in muck and
[09:18] walking in muck and walking the muck
[09:21] you don't see that if you look off to
[09:23] the [ __ ] left of the muck there's a
[09:24] sidewalk brother
[09:26] get off get off of it you have your head
[09:28] down looking in this muck
[09:30] once i saw the sidewalk got the sidewalk
[09:32] i got a little break and i got a
[09:34] different vantage point and then from
[09:35] the sidewalk i found a cliff then i
[09:37] found a mountain i got way up high on
[09:39] top of my life and looked back down on
[09:40] it and said okay
[09:41] i gotta figure this out man
[09:43] i'm not going anywhere i'm starting to
[09:45] lie i'm starting like so when you have a
[09:46] messed up foundation i started lying
[09:48] about everything i wanted people to like
[09:50] me i wanted to be accepted in some
[09:53] society of life some social society and
[09:55] i
[09:56] i said man this isn't the right way i
[09:58] messed up here i messed up here i messed
[09:59] up everywhere
[10:00] and so i realized the worst thing that
[10:02] happened to me is i lost myself i never
[10:04] had myself i never found myself had no
[10:06] self-esteem
[10:08] so i knew through working out and
[10:10] through learning because it took a lot
[10:12] for me to learn also i started finding
[10:14] self-esteem once i found that
[10:16] that's when doors started opening up i
[10:18] started i stopped caring about people
[10:20] that what they thought being judged wow
[10:22] if i say this if i started right now are
[10:24] you gonna make fun of me i stopped
[10:25] caring about that and that's my life
[10:27] started really changing for me slowly
[10:29] but surely that
[10:30] that's such an important point when
[10:32] you're talking about the working out
[10:34] because a lot of people when they think
[10:35] about working out they think of it as
[10:36] being a physical thing right no
[10:38] no
[10:39] i did it for mental yeah people always
[10:41] say my god like no
[10:43] don't don't look at it like i didn't
[10:44] care about losing weight i don't care
[10:46] about being the fastest person i think
[10:47] about i wasn't making the olympics i
[10:49] wasn't going to pros i could barely read
[10:51] and write when i was in a junior in high
[10:52] school i wasn't going anywhere
[10:55] i saw working out as a way for me to
[10:57] build calluses on my mind
[10:59] i had to callous over the victim's
[11:01] mentality so
[11:03] i watched these movies i you know i
[11:04] talked about rocket last time i was on
[11:05] here
[11:06] i always equated training
[11:09] to mental toughening
[11:11] like it always looked brutal people
[11:13] waking up early and doing all these
[11:15] things and look it looks horrible it's
[11:16] like wow i gotta start doing that not to
[11:19] get better bigger and stronger but that
[11:21] is what's gonna build me that looks
[11:22] uncomfortable that looks brutal and
[11:25] getting up early i don't want to do that
[11:27] so i made this long list of things i
[11:28] don't want to do
[11:30] and through that i found myself i
[11:32] started like i'm like you guys aren't
[11:34] doing this [ __ ] in high school you guys
[11:36] aren't getting up at five o'clock in the
[11:37] morning running over here in this golf
[11:39] course
[11:40] so i started seeing myself very
[11:41] differently than the average human being
[11:43] i was like hold on a second
[11:45] i have something they don't have
[11:47] and that's when i started to develop
[11:48] these things through working out it was
[11:50] this great
[11:52] never-ending work ethic
[11:54] and through work ethic i develop
[11:55] self-esteem now is this something that
[11:58] you learned is this something you
[11:59] learned yourself from from exercise
[12:02] yourself or is it something you had read
[12:03] or heard about like what made you equate
[12:06] this doing this and doing these
[12:08] difficult things physically to mental
[12:09] toughness to being this is the
[12:11] discipline that you need in order to get
[12:13] your life out of the situation you're in
[12:14] so i never read anything you know i i
[12:16] could barely read you know so
[12:18] i wasn't reading back then
[12:20] i just saw i watched a lot of movies and
[12:22] i was really big into visualization
[12:25] and um i always equated working out to
[12:28] struggle
[12:29] and i struggled my whole life but i ran
[12:32] from it
[12:33] so i started realizing man i got to
[12:34] start facing the struggle and i got to
[12:36] be mentally strong for the struggle
[12:38] so that's why i started coming up with
[12:40] like i i'm training for life
[12:42] mentally i'm training for life i'm not
[12:43] training for like
[12:45] to live 400 pounds and i found out on my
[12:47] own pretty much is that through this
[12:49] through through discipline through
[12:51] self-discipline through repetition do
[12:53] tons of repetition the same thing that
[12:55] you don't want to do and that's that's
[12:57] the key thing through repetition of
[12:59] things you don't want to do you develop
[13:01] mental like
[13:03] like an armor for your mind start to
[13:05] armor your mind cause your mind's like
[13:06] okay we suffer we suffer every day it's
[13:09] what we do we do stuff that sucks every
[13:11] day so then when the suck stuff comes
[13:14] you're ready for it and that's how i
[13:16] started coming up you know i just
[13:17] started being very uncomfortable and now
[13:18] it's like just a way of life
[13:20] it's a crazy thing to figure out though
[13:22] it's like that you figured it out and
[13:24] you didn't just figure it out you
[13:25] embraced it like when you were talking
[13:26] about your senior year of high school
[13:28] when you're talking about
[13:29] your your mirror being your
[13:31] accountability mirror like you had a
[13:32] radical shift like you just decided to
[13:35] not be a [ __ ] loser and to start
[13:38] tightening up and start holding yourself
[13:40] accountable and and get ready for things
[13:43] so i had this my whole life i mean i
[13:46] don't know if people believe in god or
[13:47] what i don't care what you believe in
[13:48] there's been this unrelenting voice in
[13:50] my head we all have this voice
[13:52] it's the right or wrong voice
[13:54] and a lot of times that voice guides us
[13:56] into comfort
[13:57] and
[13:58] my voice guided me to comfort a lot but
[14:01] i have this other voice i heard my whole
[14:02] life saying hey [ __ ] what are
[14:04] you doing nah man we gotta go over here
[14:08] we have to go over here to to that rock
[14:09] pile over in the [ __ ] corner where
[14:12] nobody's at that's that's where
[14:13] victory's at
[14:15] were over in that corner so this voice
[14:17] was giving me all these answers not i
[14:19] wasn't real smart kid growing up but i
[14:21] had this crazy voice in my head saying
[14:23] over there is where the [ __ ] answers
[14:25] are and i won't listen to it because
[14:27] over there was pain
[14:29] over there was me looking in the mirror
[14:30] over there was me being accountable for
[14:32] all these things that went through my
[14:33] life even though people put them on me
[14:34] it's not mine to own
[14:36] and i didn't want to go over there by
[14:37] myself
[14:38] but i had to and this voice was guiding
[14:40] me there out it's god whatever you want
[14:42] to call it uh but that's what that's
[14:44] what it was in me do you think that's
[14:46] just what you when you separate yourself
[14:48] from your ego and what you were your
[14:50] insecurities and all you like if you
[14:52] were giving yourself advice you would
[14:54] say that's what the thing is to do so do
[14:57] you think that's what it was like your
[14:58] subconscious or though you stripped away
[15:00] from all the [ __ ] when you couldn't
[15:02] lie to yourself because it's a voice in
[15:03] your head that's exactly it it's exactly
[15:05] it because it knew it knew i was a
[15:08] character
[15:09] i was trying to find myself through a
[15:10] character i was making different
[15:12] hairstyles and sagging my pants and
[15:14] i was off i was off man i was
[15:17] i was a clown i was a clown and and i
[15:20] was like this is not this is not where
[15:22] you're supposed to be in life man it's
[15:24] ugly when you look in that dirty mirror
[15:26] and you're trying to do a new hairstyle
[15:28] to go to school you know i had a
[15:29] hairstyle one time where i shaved the
[15:31] top of my head you know how old men had
[15:34] the hair like leaving their head yeah
[15:36] yeah so i went to school with hair on
[15:38] the side of my head and in my back and i
[15:40] shaved the the whole top of my head i
[15:43] just i went to school like that you know
[15:45] and then i had like what did the kids
[15:47] say
[15:48] i wanted to i don't remember what they
[15:50] said but i was just a funny dude you
[15:52] know so that was my thing i was the
[15:54] funny dude that came into school like
[15:56] criss cross came out when i was in high
[15:58] school so my pants were backwards i seen
[15:59] what i passed backwards sagged down past
[16:02] my ass crack shirt turned backwards with
[16:04] a toothbrush in my mouth with the
[16:06] reverse part the reverse part is your
[16:08] head is shaved and you have some hair
[16:11] on top just a little piece of hair
[16:13] versus like a like a part right through
[16:15] hair the part was on a bald head
[16:18] so it was just i i i would sit at home
[16:21] instead of studying i would think about
[16:23] what can i do to impress a [ __ ]
[16:25] at school
[16:26] and that became my life
[16:28] and that is
[16:29] it's a
[16:31] long road to hoe to get to the guy who
[16:32] says now you'll never smile on any
[16:34] podcast looks so serious i look at that
[16:36] [ __ ] i'm like you [ __ ] have no
[16:38] idea
[16:39] who i am who where i've come from to get
[16:42] here today you could have probably been
[16:44] an entertainer like you probably because
[16:46] you were doing all that kind of [ __ ] i
[16:48] have some jokes joe
[16:49] i got some jokes yeah you do so
[16:52] what people read in this book can't hurt
[16:54] me it's a sad story it's a horrible
[16:55] story it's a tragic story it's a story
[16:57] that made me who in the day but
[16:59] you have to learn to laugh at yourself
[17:01] too once you once you go through that
[17:02] [ __ ] yeah now so there's a lot of parts
[17:05] in there there's a lot of me against a
[17:06] lot of white people you know
[17:08] and i have a routine that i won't do so
[17:11] people who hire me to speak i'm not
[17:12] going to do the routine i often do it
[17:14] sometimes think about it i was a 36
[17:17] black guy to go through still training
[17:19] okay no matter how many people out of
[17:21] probably looking at um probably 11 12
[17:25] to make it through probably 13 000 seals
[17:28] i was probably the 36 i was a 36 black
[17:30] guy to make it through and over since
[17:32] like the like 1940s you know you're
[17:34] looking at almost 70 years wow yeah so
[17:36] you know you know you know do the math
[17:37] on that so there's not a lot of black
[17:38] guys and so i take that and i make a
[17:40] nice comedy skit out of that [ __ ]
[17:43] you know like like like the first time
[17:44] they tied me up and threw me it's called
[17:46] drown proofing yeah so i'm negative
[17:48] boring as hell you know me too oh i'm
[17:50] related to that big time yeah she wanted
[17:52] a few white boys man they're that
[17:53] negative boy you sit like a rock
[17:55] and that's hard so imagine them getting
[17:57] your hands and feet tying your ass up
[17:59] and throwing in the [ __ ] water and
[18:00] say swim
[18:01] ah it was like throwing a cat in the
[18:03] water with [ __ ] brick on them so i
[18:05] was just losing my [ __ ] mind so it's
[18:07] so many things i had to get over you
[18:09] know and i found humor i found humor in
[18:12] my suffering
[18:13] i was like [ __ ] what are you
[18:14] doing out here goggins like this is
[18:16] crazy like you're you're literally
[18:18] trying to
[18:19] reinvent the wheel but i was trying to
[18:21] reinvent my mind
[18:23] i was trying to reinvent my mind and i
[18:25] used every single tactic possible to do
[18:27] that
[18:28] i didn't want to live you know live in
[18:30] this world where i was a fake human
[18:31] being anymore
[18:33] and i was tired of blaming everybody for
[18:34] where i was at
[18:35] my dad beat me this happened i mean my
[18:37] dad ran prostitutes man my dad literally
[18:39] snatched the soul out of my mom like my
[18:41] mom is still battling like after my mom
[18:44] left my dad
[18:45] and that's why i'm talking about in the
[18:46] book she got married three times for a
[18:49] total of six months
[18:51] you know i don't go there and i'm not
[18:52] gonna talk about the guys she married so
[18:54] this woman was she's beautiful she's
[18:56] she's so smart all this stuff man this
[18:58] guy literally stripped her soul away and
[19:01] i was a young kid watching it
[19:03] and i had no soul to begin with
[19:05] and my my brother he has a story that he
[19:07] could write eight books
[19:09] you know my dad just came through and
[19:11] just washed us all clean
[19:12] so to
[19:14] to to come around he died about four
[19:16] years ago four or five years ago not for
[19:18] sure i didn't go to the funeral but i
[19:19] forgave him
[19:20] so i saw my dad through an
[19:22] eight-year-old's eye so so we left when
[19:24] i was eight
[19:25] and then at 22 i went back
[19:27] to see him through a grown man's eyes
[19:28] and he was the same person i remembered
[19:30] but i had to you can't live with hate
[19:32] you cannot move forward as much as that
[19:35] guy tried to ruin all of our lives
[19:38] that's where i came from i had to figure
[19:40] out the origin of where i started from
[19:43] so when i was going back through my life
[19:44] trying to fix who i am the [ __ ] up
[19:46] person i was
[19:48] like if your knee hurts it's usually not
[19:50] your [ __ ] knee that's hurting
[19:52] it's something else man like it could be
[19:54] a tight quad it could be the right leg
[19:56] if it's the left leg you got to find out
[19:57] the origin of where all this [ __ ] began
[20:00] and i it was him so i had to go back to
[20:02] where you know
[20:04] my roots and the origin of all this
[20:05] happen and it's hard to do that did you
[20:07] make peace with him i made big piece
[20:08] with
[20:09] so we didn't have a peaceful
[20:10] conversation we you know we we we left
[20:13] very animal he's a he's a he's a vicious
[20:15] man
[20:16] he he was a vicious man i mean medieval
[20:18] [ __ ] so
[20:21] i had become a medieval [ __ ] at
[20:23] that time i was 22 and i was the big boy
[20:25] and
[20:25] so i was no longer the guy who was
[20:27] afraid it was not like hey i want to
[20:29] kill you type of [ __ ] and we were
[20:31] sitting at denny's
[20:33] after an all-night skate or whatever the
[20:34] hell you know he owned bars and skating
[20:36] rings like that and
[20:38] so we were sitting down and we kind of
[20:40] got into it and i just kind of left
[20:42] and but i had to make peace with it in
[20:44] myself
[20:45] i i could not hold on to that hate cause
[20:47] hold on to that hate was half the reason
[20:48] why i kept falling into the same pattern
[20:51] of failing
[20:52] i had to get i had to start dumping off
[20:54] some baggage i had to start figuring out
[20:56] me
[20:57] through him and that's all he was there
[20:58] for he was the origin i had to figure
[21:01] him out figure out why he was so evil to
[21:03] my mom to me my brother and i had to
[21:06] start studying him like a lot of people
[21:08] have situations where someone does
[21:10] something and we all attack that person
[21:12] like like on the media if someone does
[21:14] something wrong everybody now is [ __ ]
[21:16] perfect and we now judge this guy
[21:18] i don't judge him i don't judge anybody
[21:21] what i do is i start studying them why
[21:23] did they do that
[21:25] not in a judging way i want to learn
[21:26] from you and what'd you get out of your
[21:28] dad i got that he was he grew up rough
[21:31] he had he was very insecure had a lot of
[21:33] kids
[21:34] and
[21:35] his insecurities just trickled over
[21:38] onto us
[21:40] so yeah he jacked us up real good but he
[21:43] never fixed himself so if you never fix
[21:45] yourself
[21:46] the next person in line is going to get
[21:48] the wrath and we were next in line
[21:50] you know his his first wife you know
[21:52] killed herself or whatever happened and
[21:54] you know got burned up in the house or
[21:56] something some craziness and there's a
[21:57] lot of stuff that goes on there that i
[21:58] didn't put in the book because i don't
[22:00] feel like going to court yeah but um
[22:02] yeah that's uh it was it was a lot of
[22:03] stuff
[22:05] you know one of the great parts about
[22:07] this book is that you you detail exactly
[22:11] what was going through your mind in
[22:13] terms of like your weaknesses and how
[22:15] you had failed and and then
[22:18] you it's not just one time like you you
[22:21] do the thing in high school where you
[22:23] get your [ __ ] together and then you join
[22:26] the military and then you wind up
[22:28] getting fat again
[22:30] and then when you go when you have to
[22:31] lose what is 106 pounds in three months
[22:34] yep to to to qualify for seal training
[22:37] yep that's insane yeah because when i
[22:40] realized at that time once again i
[22:42] failed again i thought so what you're
[22:44] talking about is i took this asvab test
[22:46] you know i didn't know how to read and
[22:47] write pretty much in high school i was
[22:48] like a fourth grade reading level
[22:50] and i took that test a few times
[22:52] and i finally passed it and when i
[22:54] passed it i actually drove my car to the
[22:57] to the daggone airport and watched
[23:00] planes take off
[23:01] because i was like i'm gonna be on one
[23:02] of those planes one day going to air
[23:04] force boot camp so i i never
[23:07] i always fix the things on the surface
[23:09] so if i couldn't read and write learn to
[23:11] read and write
[23:12] i i would always fix these things on the
[23:14] surface level and so whenever something
[23:17] hard would would
[23:18] like like raise ugly head
[23:20] i didn't have any kind of tools to
[23:22] handle it like man i thought i fixed
[23:24] this already man but no i didn't go deep
[23:27] into the dungeon of my soul to say okay
[23:29] what is making you a quitter
[23:31] what is making you a weak man what is
[23:33] making you afraid
[23:35] and so
[23:36] that's why i kept on quitting and going
[23:38] back to start or not knowing how to get
[23:40] through hard times and that's why i was
[23:43] telling people i'm not a theorist
[23:45] i didn't study like you know i didn't
[23:46] study a [ __ ] book
[23:48] i literally put myself in a fire
[23:51] repeatedly like a sword you put a sword
[23:53] in the fire repeatedly and repeat if you
[23:55] keep on doing that you're going to get a
[23:56] nice sword and you keep on beating it
[23:58] you got to beat the [ __ ] out of it
[24:00] and that's what i am
[24:01] yeah i i became that i i said okay we
[24:04] can't quit we got to figure out why you
[24:07] are this [ __ ]
[24:08] why are you this [ __ ] man what is wrong
[24:11] with you what's going on here so i kept
[24:12] on putting the sword back in the dagger
[24:14] on fire and i just beat it harder and i
[24:17] beat it harder before i knew i started
[24:19] realizing
[24:21] all right man the brain is starting to
[24:24] get hard
[24:25] the brain is starting to get hard i'm no
[24:29] longer a theorist i'm now a practitioner
[24:31] i put it in hell i dissected it while
[24:34] it's in hell because you can't dissect
[24:35] anything in a normal environment you
[24:38] can't dissect anything in 72 degree
[24:39] weather
[24:40] you must put it in the [ __ ] freezer
[24:42] and freeze the [ __ ] out of it and then
[24:44] you dissect it dissect it when it's
[24:46] miserable dissect the brain when all
[24:48] this thinking about is i need to get out
[24:50] of here man
[24:51] i want to get out of the [ __ ] freezer
[24:53] open the door
[24:54] and he said nah
[24:56] five more seconds man five more seconds
[24:58] in the freezer and that's when you start
[25:00] to pick that brain apart and that's what
[25:02] all this stuff did to me i kept on
[25:04] putting myself back into the freezer or
[25:06] the fire and beating the [ __ ] out of
[25:09] myself
[25:10] mentally and physically
[25:12] before i knew it this is what happened
[25:15] wow
[25:16] it's an interesting way to self-teach
[25:19] yes like most people that
[25:22] you know you talk to that are
[25:23] disciplined
[25:24] they
[25:25] you know they have something that they
[25:27] read that inspired them they have
[25:30] certain people that they look up to
[25:32] there's certain you know coaches that
[25:35] taught them there's certain important
[25:36] moments in their life but for you it's a
[25:39] system of failure and and
[25:42] reflection and then rebooting that's it
[25:45] repeated failure
[25:46] and people think a lot of times it
[25:48] taught me that i'm angry oh my god you
[25:50] sound so angry you cut so much oh my god
[25:52] why you cuss so much why are you so
[25:53] crazy
[25:55] if you read my book i cannot explain my
[25:57] life by saying hey it was a merry
[25:59] [ __ ] christmas man no it wasn't i
[26:02] want you i want you to go there with me
[26:04] i'm taking you there with me
[26:06] i'm a storyteller i want to take your
[26:09] ass down paradise where i so the house i
[26:12] lived in buffalo new york that i got my
[26:14] ass beat every day funny we lived on
[26:16] paradise road
[26:18] and it was anything but [ __ ] paradise
[26:20] so i want you to go there with me you
[26:23] want to learn from me let me take your
[26:24] ass home let me take you there so that's
[26:27] the whole thing about it man we're
[26:28] scared to dive into
[26:31] our lives what made us who we are
[26:34] the beautiful people that we are we're
[26:36] all jacked up in so many ways that's the
[26:38] beauty of us
[26:40] that's the beauty of me
[26:41] i'm jacked up
[26:43] but i figured out my own little process
[26:45] on how to get unjacked up and how to i'm
[26:47] not gonna get the same you know i'm not
[26:48] gonna get the same way you're gonna get
[26:49] there you may get there by going
[26:50] pointing to point b
[26:52] i might go point c to d to e to f i want
[26:55] to be there the same way you are just a
[26:57] little harder that's how i train my
[26:58] brain
[26:59] so it's just different i'm a different
[27:01] thinker
[27:02] when you stop and think about all the
[27:05] different times that you did have to
[27:07] reboot and how you you you found like
[27:09] new goals and you found new inspiration
[27:12] you fired up a new discipline and you
[27:14] became stronger and harder and you got
[27:17] one of the things that people always
[27:18] look for in life they look for a point
[27:22] where they can rest yes oh i'm going to
[27:24] retire
[27:25] you know like people love they love that
[27:28] expression the golden years they love
[27:30] that expression yeah
[27:32] they love the they love the idea of
[27:34] struggle as long as it ends and then
[27:36] when it ends they're going to have a
[27:37] nice comfortable spot it must end the
[27:40] suffering must end yeah you should relax
[27:42] man you've done so much that's right
[27:44] you've really done so much but this
[27:47] the idea of reaching this golden year
[27:50] is is it's a very flawed idea because
[27:53] it's an idea that you're gonna you're
[27:54] gonna work hard but then you're gonna
[27:56] reach the finish line but there's no
[27:58] finish line no it doesn't exist
[28:00] that's the scary thing about life my
[28:02] friend that is a scary thing right and
[28:03] that's what fatigues me people go man
[28:06] why don't you ever smile there's no
[28:08] [ __ ] end my friend

[29:30] so he had people running for days and
[29:32] days and days he invited me out there

[29:35] the barclay last year but couldn't do it
[29:37] because of the book so i'm supposed to
[29:39] do it this year
[29:40] but now you know we'll see again how the
[29:42] schedule goes but yeah that that's a
[29:43] sick
[29:44] sick man i've done a couple of his races
[29:46] and like he has one called strolling jim
[29:48] i actually won that one in 2016. but
[29:51] he's a he's a sick man what is this
[29:52] scrolling
[29:54] this is probably easiest race it's like
[29:55] it's like through the back country of uh
[29:57] tennessee it's a 41 mile race on the
[29:59] road it's one of the first you know
[30:01] ultra marathons out there ever
[30:03] and my mom lives in nashville so it's
[30:05] like an hour drive i went up there and
[30:06] it was like when my first race is back
[30:08] after me being all sick and jacked up
[30:09] for so long and i got lucky had a good
[30:12] race and i happened to want it you know
[30:13] you were talking about psoas muscle yeah
[30:16] we have this thing now that we got what
[30:17] does that call the pro pro so right so
[30:19] right have you ever used one i have it
[30:21] also i i saw it in there that that
[30:23] little black contraption yeah that hard
[30:25] plastic thing yeah phenomenal it's evil
[30:28] man yeah yeah it's good it's amazing i
[30:30] started getting tightness in that when i
[30:32] was running a lot like i'd never gotten
[30:34] tightness in that area before yeah it
[30:36] seems like that's a running thing right
[30:37] it's a running thing and also a very
[30:39] stressed thing
[30:40] you know if you're real stressed out man
[30:42] like for me like i talked about the
[30:43] origin where like where things start my
[30:45] body was so wrapped tight i didn't know

[33:14] to do whatever they're gonna do
[33:15] what do you do when you have no external
[33:17] motivation
[33:19] it's about the internal
[33:21] what do you say to yourself

[33:26] keeps you going

[36:41] that you have to struggle
[36:43] you have to struggle the bigger the
[36:45] struggle the bigger the peace the bigger
[36:47] the suffering the more peace i'm not
[36:49] just saying this because you're here but
[36:50] this book is valuable this book is very
[36:52] valuable it's valuable to people like
[36:54] anybody that you know i mean biographies
[36:56] are very always valuable when you get to
[36:59] see the mindset of a person who's done
[37:01] things that you haven't done you get to
[37:02] understand like that they're overcoming
[37:04] sort of the same
[37:06] sort of situations in their mind that
[37:08] you are same insecurities and pitfalls
[37:10] but yeah everybody's going through it
[37:11] man yeah everybody that's that's
[37:13] something i say i'm blessed that way
[37:15] that
[37:16] my story
[37:18] there's no color involved in it
[37:20] it's a human story about struggle
[37:22] and i happen to be in so many different
[37:25] situations that so many people can
[37:26] relate to about struggle
[37:28] that
[37:29] i guarantee you mark my word you read
[37:31] that book there will be
[37:33] a section of that book that resonates
[37:35] with you hardcore it will make you think
[37:37] if if you're not ready to think about
[37:39] your life
[37:40] and think about
[37:41] you know where you can be and think
[37:43] about what you haven't done the book's
[37:44] not for you if you're not ready to sell
[37:47] to really self-reflect and hold yourself
[37:48] accountable for where you're at and
[37:49] where you're not
[37:51] the book is not for you is real i've
[37:52] read a lot of self-help books and i've
[37:54] listened to a lot of self-help books on
[37:56] tape too and a lot of just some of them
[37:58] that i have to shut off i have to shut
[38:01] off a quarter way and i feel like
[38:02] someone's lying to me i just like you're
[38:03] bullshitting me you're just saying
[38:05] things this i'm not this doesn't
[38:07] resonate with me it doesn't it's not
[38:09] working right like i'll give it a chance
[38:10] i'll give it a chance but if i'm you
[38:12] know a half hour in two hours in it's
[38:14] still the same nonsense i don't feel
[38:16] anything right i'm getting itchy
[38:18] listening to you
[38:20] you know i just want to pull the
[38:21] headphones off and i'll just kill it and
[38:22] i'll stop it this is the total opposite
[38:25] this one man i was i was go i was
[38:26] running extra miles so i could stay with
[38:29] the headphones on and the
[38:31] the thing that i think is going to
[38:32] happen with this book is people are
[38:34] going to get it they're going to get a
[38:35] hold of whether it's the audiobook or
[38:36] their book book and they're going to
[38:38] they're going to recommend it and then
[38:39] it's going to spread like wildfire this
[38:41] is a powerful book this is a real
[38:43] self-help book this is like this is a
[38:46] real one like it's not like uh someone
[38:49] orchestrates this whole thing like what
[38:51] i'm going to do is i'm going to become a
[38:52] motivator i'm going to be i'm going to
[38:53] be a personal influencer i'm going to be
[38:55] that guy that goes out there and tells
[38:56] people you can optimize your life here's
[38:59] how you do it and there's so many of
[39:01] those [ __ ] guys out there right yeah
[39:03] that's not me man i know this one dude i
[39:04] ran into him recently i ran into him at
[39:06] this restaurant he's fat as [ __ ] he's
[39:07] got this big old belly and i know he
[39:09] does these these motivational things and
[39:12] i'm looking at him i'm like what are you
[39:14] talking about man like you're weak right
[39:17] look at your body look at your own
[39:18] temple look at your meat vehicle you're
[39:20] carrying around this [ __ ] donut
[39:23] around your waist it's just he was
[39:25] eating shitty food and he looked soft
[39:27] and like wake up [ __ ] so many people
[39:29] are doing that now man how many people
[39:31] are talking this noise exactly and i see
[39:34] them yeah i know them i'm not gonna say
[39:36] names but i know them i'm like man dude
[39:39] you know why my life is miserable right
[39:40] now because i can't go on your show
[39:43] right now your podcast if i didn't get
[39:45] after it this morning
[39:47] so i cannot talk to people
[39:49] unless you're authentic unless i'm
[39:50] authentic because i used to be the most
[39:52] unauthentic [ __ ] on the planet
[39:54] now i have this voicemail saying oh no
[39:57] i'll call you up if i lie to you about
[39:58] something even a white lie hey yo joe
[40:00] guess what dude
[40:03] i [ __ ] lied to you man like that
[40:04] wasn't real like it would bother me that
[40:06] badly now you know so another thing i
[40:09] didn't what's funny about this book
[40:10] stuff man i didn't set out to write a
[40:11] book
[40:13] like literally man when i was 24 years
[40:14] old and a cow's fat spraying for
[40:16] cockroaches eating donuts and drinking
[40:17] milkshakes
[40:19] i did not plan on doing this
[40:21] all i wanted to do was change the
[40:23] [ __ ] reflection in that dagger mirror
[40:25] this is all just a box it's it's it's a
[40:27] byproduct of
[40:28] of that and that's that's the funny
[40:30] thing about it like everybody's like oh
[40:31] my god david goggles what you know what
[40:32] tell you i'm like
[40:34] what the [ __ ] that's why it works though
[40:37] unbelievable
[40:38] it works because you really did do it
[40:40] you really did do all those things and
[40:42] you show how you did it and you're not
[40:44] using any [ __ ] theatrical jargon no
[40:47] you're not you know you're you know
[40:49] you're not saying a bunch of buzzwords
[40:51] can you live the life of an actualized
[40:53] person i can show you how and you look
[40:55] at this guy talking he's got a neck like
[40:57] a pencil and his
[40:59] his body is just frail like you don't
[41:01] even understand adversity you don't
[41:03] understand overcoming this is not the
[41:05] secret you know this isn't about the law
[41:07] of [ __ ] attraction yeah there ain't
[41:09] no attraction here brother
[41:12] this ain't no attraction here man this
[41:14] book is straight up yeah they love
[41:16] nonsense yeah this is no nonsense man no
[41:19] nonsense this is a real self-help book
[41:21] man this is the real deal that's how you
[41:23] self-help you're self-help by people
[41:24] who've done it and you learn what they
[41:26] did and you realize there's no shortcuts
[41:28] right and then you learn to embrace that
[41:30] no shortcut mentality and enjoy enjoy
[41:33] the suffering and the grind of it and
[41:35] what we talked about earlier there's no
[41:37] [ __ ] finish line doesn't exist you
[41:39] know what's funny about that is i have
[41:41] people now so when i was in the worst
[41:43] part of my life
[41:45] those people want to bring you back in
[41:47] those people's like like you can see who
[41:49] you hang out with like when you're in
[41:50] your worst and when you're trying to get
[41:52] better with what makes it hard to get
[41:53] better is that you are hanging around
[41:55] people who like let's say you're an
[41:57] alcoholic you hang around people who
[41:59] drink
[42:00] and i say you want to stop drinking
[42:02] those people want to bring you back in
[42:04] like i used to be this guy this guy who
[42:05] was you know who wasn't worth anything
[42:08] now those people who are still there
[42:10] they're
[42:11] 16 17 18 30 years ago they're trying to
[42:13] get you back there so the hardest part
[42:14] you got gotta see who you're hanging out
[42:15] with man
[42:17] you gotta hang out with the people who
[42:18] you wanna be like the most yeah people
[42:20] will definitely drag you they'll jack it
[42:22] down and especially if you around
[42:23] someone who makes a lot of excuses and
[42:25] they're always failing oh this is just
[42:27] like they're they're the opposite of
[42:29] inspiration they're like a vacuum 100
[42:31] sucking it out of you why are you doing
[42:33] that today man
[42:34] why are you getting up again so early
[42:35] why are you doing this why are you doing
[42:37] this
[42:38] the people you're hanging around will
[42:39] suck the [ __ ] life out of you yeah
[42:41] sometimes just gotta be alone man get
[42:43] your [ __ ] in and then there's also
[42:44] people that are gonna be around that are
[42:46] always failing and they're always
[42:47] [ __ ] up and then always coming to you
[42:49] to try to get you to help them exactly
[42:52] a giant burden yes never look in the
[42:54] mirror and get their own [ __ ] together
[42:56] they're always looking for external help
[42:58] that's right always looking for a storm
[43:00] people don't want to go in deep man all
[43:01] the ants are inside of you
[43:03] it's a very primitive way how like how
[43:05] this book is written it's primitive
[43:07] it's it's very barbarian it's how we all
[43:10] think it's how it's it's how man once
[43:13] walked the earth
[43:14] and then we get all soft and all these
[43:16] computers and [ __ ] we start going away
[43:18] from
[43:19] the the most powerful thing we have is
[43:20] our [ __ ] brain it's our mind and we
[43:23] don't use it anymore
[43:24] so you know it's like everything has to
[43:26] be so quick yeah you use your mind when
[43:29] it comes to certain things right but
[43:30] what you're saying is you don't use your
[43:32] mind when it comes to enduring exactly
[43:35] that is it you can't google that [ __ ]
[43:37] right hey let me google how to suffer
[43:41] no
[43:42] that ain't gonna be in there bro
[43:44] ain't gonna be in there
[43:45] it could be in there
[43:47] there's no answer it's not in there it
[43:49] doesn't exist
[43:51] find some water real cold and what's
[43:52] interesting is that that is a mind thing
[43:55] and people think of mind things they
[43:57] think of calculating mathematics
[44:00] literature no no no no no there's many
[44:02] aspects to the mind that's it don't
[44:04] overthink it yeah don't overthink it put
[44:06] your shoes on lace them up
[44:09] that's all you got to do my friend
[44:12] don't overthink the process yeah but see
[44:14] what because you've overcome and because
[44:16] you've accomplished so much now that
[44:17] even when you you talk about that moment
[44:21] of like embracing that suck like you see
[44:24] the big ass smile on your face like
[44:26] you've you've got a total different
[44:28] approach to it than the average person
[44:30] oh yeah the average person you're
[44:31] talking to them about doing chin ups for
[44:33] 24 hours or anything [ __ ] crazy they
[44:35] don't look at they're like oh
[44:37] there's like a a negative a doom feeling
[44:39] that's the thing about it man i talk
[44:40] about my book open-mindedness
[44:43] what separates me from a lot of people
[44:44] is they go into an
[44:46] a daunting task
[44:48] and the task is overwhelming like when i
[44:50] heard the pull-up break was 4020
[44:51] pull-ups and i was talking about
[44:52] breaking this record
[44:54] people are like oh my god
[44:56] i went right to a pen and paper like
[44:58] what are you doing i'm doing the math
[45:00] man
[45:01] what are you talking about i'm open mind
[45:03] to the fact that okay if i do five
[45:04] pull-ups on the minute for so many hours
[45:05] i can get some pull-ups in how much time
[45:07] do i have to rest i was breaking the
[45:09] math down you have to be open-minded to
[45:11] the possibilities that i can do this
[45:13] once you shut your mind down to the
[45:14] possibility that it can be achieved
[45:16] there's no way it can happen so that's
[45:17] why my my eyes and my body light up
[45:19] about things because i know that if
[45:22] you're in a fight you have to attack
[45:25] you have to keep attacking
[45:28] the enemy has to know he is not going to
[45:30] give up you must break the soul of
[45:32] whatever the [ __ ] is in front of you
[45:34] that's what i realized i was never
[45:35] breaking the soul of anything in front
[45:37] of me
[45:38] so that's why i came with the thing
[45:39] called taking souls in my book
[45:41] i started to devise ways to break
[45:43] a soul
[45:44] of a human being of an object of
[45:47] whatever's in front of me if you keep on
[45:49] attacking something nothing wants to
[45:50] stand in front of anything
[45:53] that is relentless
[45:55] nothing
[45:56] the taken soul part of the book is
[45:58] really interesting because uh you talked
[46:00] about like the the mind shift that you
[46:03] had when you were in buds yes sir yeah
[46:05] that was that's an intense part of the
[46:07] book it's it is uh
[46:09] that's when a lot of stuff started
[46:10] clicking man
[46:11] i started watching those instructors on
[46:13] the side you know there's there's
[46:15] three shifts there's eight instructors
[46:17] three shifts because you know the guys
[46:18] going through through hell week they're
[46:20] up all day and all night for 130 hours
[46:23] this is the promised land of mental
[46:25] hardening for me i love this place and
[46:28] you have the instructors who you know
[46:30] you know they've been there done that
[46:31] now they're instructing you so they do
[46:33] their eight hour shift they have their
[46:35] parkas on it's usually cold coffee
[46:36] drinking their coffee
[46:38] and they're beating the crap out of us
[46:40] and when i started realizing i started
[46:41] playing mind games and i was like you
[46:42] know what i bet these [ __ ]
[46:45] are looking at us
[46:47] judging themselves about when they were
[46:49] going through hell week about let me see
[46:51] i'm looking at goggins right now i was
[46:52] better than him i was bearing that guy
[46:54] bearing that [ __ ] over there and i was
[46:56] like
[46:57] okay
[46:58] okay you gotta judge me right
[47:02] so it's not gonna do to you so what i
[47:03] started doing was i got my boat crew
[47:05] boat crew too it's in the book it's a
[47:06] great great story said come here guys
[47:08] you can't break boat crude you can't
[47:10] break broke crew 2. so
[47:13] it's wednesday is wednesday and
[47:14] everybody's broken everybody's beat up
[47:16] man and like this you start moving like
[47:17] a robot everybody's like just kind of
[47:19] just trying to get through helbig now
[47:21] and your energy zap and they know
[47:22] wednesdays like that over the hump i
[47:24] love that you talked about that in the
[47:25] book too that they put it in your head
[47:27] wednesday you're gonna be tired oh yeah
[47:28] and that's another thing they they tell
[47:30] you how you're supposed to feel
[47:32] so
[47:33] you are feeling that way i was like ah
[47:35] don't let these [ __ ] tell you
[47:36] how you supposed to feel no it's day one
[47:39] [ __ ] this is hour one so i was
[47:42] getting my broker all jacked up i said
[47:43] we're gonna take these [ __ ]
[47:44] souls so when they had us doing this
[47:47] simple thing that guys are struggling
[47:49] with broker two is just lost in the
[47:51] [ __ ] boat near yelling yeah he can't
[47:53] [ __ ] hurt us can't hurt boat crew too
[47:56] and i looked on the instructor's faces
[47:58] and it looked like someone had just
[48:00] [ __ ] with their soul
[48:02] and i looked at my guys my broker and i
[48:04] said hey guess what those [ __ ]
[48:06] aren't [ __ ] tonight because we own
[48:08] space in their [ __ ] head
[48:10] we own space they're gonna think about
[48:12] us tonight they could think about how
[48:13] they're killing boners that's right
[48:15] how
[48:16] how on wednesday are these guys doing
[48:19] this and screaming out you can't hurt
[48:20] people too we were we were bringing the
[48:23] fight we were attacking so so when you
[48:24] keep on doing that guess what people
[48:26] start doing
[48:27] i ain't [ __ ] with these guys no more
[48:29] so bro crew 2 got a lot more sleep roku
[48:31] 2 just became that broke like hey
[48:34] because we just kept charging and we
[48:35] started fueling off of that we started
[48:37] fueling out the fact that man it takes
[48:39] one second of energy
[48:41] to steal everybody's
[48:43] and then you have all the energy you
[48:44] need
[48:45] that's all you need you need to look at
[48:46] someone's eyes you know how this when
[48:48] you fight somebody you broke that
[48:49] [ __ ] he's like oh god man i
[48:51] don't want to go back the next round and
[48:53] you feel like my god i can fight all day
[48:55] i can fight all day long that's what
[48:58] taking souls is
[48:59] but you have to have the will
[49:01] the heart the courage
[49:03] to go
[49:04] that distance when you're exactly jacked
[49:07] up you have nothing left to give
[49:09] and give more
[49:11] that is an interesting thing about the
[49:12] mind is that you can find inspiration
[49:15] and when you find inspiration when you
[49:16] get charged up all of a sudden you have
[49:18] energy that's right it's right it's
[49:20] weird i talked about in the book also is
[49:22] about
[49:23] i learned how to control
[49:25] my adrenals
[49:28] if you know how you know how you get
[49:29] that fight or flight response when you
[49:30] get to move real quick yeah and you know
[49:33] i i started learning the mind a lot how
[49:35] to get myself jacked
[49:37] extremely fast like in a horrible
[49:40] environment when everybody's miserable
[49:42] i learned how to really find strength in
[49:44] the misery
[49:45] when everybody's suffering everybody's
[49:47] all poopy past and their mentality's
[49:49] down and everything i started just like
[49:51] my god this is where i shine
[49:54] and i started using all that misery
[49:57] for tons and tons of tons of drive and
[49:59] motivation to
[50:01] to then lead people further
[50:04] because you can get a lot of power
[50:05] through misery and once people see that
[50:07] my god cognizance is [ __ ] going
[50:10] then everybody says roger that let me
[50:12] get my [ __ ] and go too
[50:14] so i started realizing that if you can
[50:16] just find strength just a little bit
[50:18] longer you'll have a crew of people
[50:20] following you along the way
[50:22] and that is another thing that no one
[50:24] can ever teach you because you you're
[50:26] going to have to learn that on your own
[50:28] you're going to have to figure out how
[50:29] to pull that energy out of your mind on
[50:32] your own there's not
[50:34] there's there's no book you can read now
[50:36] all sudden i have it i've got the
[50:37] technique now i know how to do it yeah
[50:39] no it's it's a a grind that you have to
[50:42] start and finish on your own you have to
[50:44] take great pleasure in the fact that no
[50:46] one wants to be with the [ __ ] you're at
[50:48] right now
[50:49] great pleasure in that almost makes you
[50:51] know it has to bring a passion out of
[50:53] you it has to bring something very very
[50:55] weird out of you man like
[50:57] you know people don't really understand
[50:58] what that is when you're in the worst
[51:00] environment possible the worst situation
[51:01] possible and everybody's looking like
[51:03] god man i hope this ends
[51:05] and you see that
[51:06] time slows down and you see that you're
[51:08] you're feeling that
[51:10] everybody has that look on their face
[51:11] like god that's got to go i don't want
[51:13] to be anymore have you ever gotten rabdo
[51:15] wrapped on my lowest oh yes sir did you
[51:17] get it yes sir yes sir when did you get
[51:20] it i got it on my second pull-up record
[51:21] attempt and i talked about it a little
[51:23] bit in the book there um
[51:25] and
[51:26] i have sickle cell trait and a young kid
[51:28] just died from rhabdo
[51:30] from uh because sickle cell's not a good
[51:32] thing obviously um and
[51:34] rhabdo's a bad thing for having sickle
[51:36] cell you have sickle cell trait but you
[51:38] don't have the disease i don't have the
[51:39] disease a buddy of mine died from it
[51:41] when i was a kid really yeah
[51:43] a guy used to fight with us to train
[51:45] with
[51:45] yeah he was always sick he'd have it get
[51:48] sick his heart he'll be gone he'd be out
[51:50] of the gym for months and he'd come back
[51:51] and he'd just be trying to get his body
[51:53] back in shape again
[51:56] then he went up dying
[51:57] he's a talented guy too
[51:59] when you got it what did you have to do
[52:02] so they put me to hospital for a while
[52:04] um that's when my hand got real messed
[52:05] up
[52:06] and my fluids were extremely low and i
[52:09] had done like i think i did 3 000
[52:11] pull-ups
[52:12] and they're like man your body is
[52:14] wrecked up were you just not drinking
[52:16] water while you're doing it i was
[52:17] drinking water but not enough so i was
[52:19] sipping this carbohydrate drink
[52:22] and um
[52:23] my calories were extremely low i didn't
[52:25] know how much i was going to burn
[52:26] through and you burn through an awful
[52:28] lot of calories man doing that many
[52:29] pull-ups so that many hours yeah and
[52:31] with the repetition
[52:32] with using the single points of just my
[52:34] hands and my biceps my back
[52:36] like my body was swollen like the
[52:38] pillsbury doughboy
[52:39] i mean it looked horrible
[52:41] and um so
[52:43] they kept me in there for a while but
[52:44] how long probably about eight hours
[52:47] i was about eight hours on ivs and stuff
[52:49] like that so they just it's basically a
[52:51] ton of drinks yeah
[52:54] tons of fluid and they sent me home
[52:56] though
[52:57] so i went home that night
[52:59] and how long did you wait before you
[53:01] jump back at it
[53:02] i think i was back on the pull-up bar
[53:04] about a week and a half later
[53:07] and then i broke the record six six
[53:09] weeks later i broke the record jesus
[53:11] christ
[53:13] so when you when you did get back on the
[53:15] pull-up bar
[53:16] was how [ __ ] up was your body from
[53:19] it was bad but what i do is like what
[53:22] i've done through everything it which
[53:23] isn't real smart i mean it works for me
[53:25] so i'm not saying do this is i've
[53:28] trained through a lot of my injuries
[53:30] and i started developing i i started
[53:32] doing that in buds and still training
[53:33] because i instill training you know they
[53:34] know you guys start from day one or they
[53:36] just kick you out so i started from day
[53:38] one enough so my third time going
[53:40] through i was really jacked up well you
[53:42] went you had pneumonia yeah i had
[53:43] pneumonia and i had really bad stress
[53:45] fractures
[53:46] so my stretch fracture so i was
[53:47] literally i would put a sock on and then
[53:50] duct tape my foot all the way up to the
[53:52] top of my or to the middle of my ankle
[53:54] or to my calf and because my stress
[53:56] fracture was so bad so like the pivot
[53:58] point between my ankle and my shin i
[54:01] just cast that all the way up
[54:03] and so i went through for several months
[54:05] for a few months with stretch fractures
[54:07] what was crazy about that is they healed
[54:10] by the time i got to third phase my
[54:12] stress reactions were healed wow and i
[54:14] don't even know how rhyme or reason
[54:16] behind it i ran on them a few months
[54:18] later they were healed wow so i don't
[54:20] know what that means just push through
[54:22] the agony and eventually your body just
[54:24] said this crazy [ __ ] is not gonna stop
[54:27] it's true statement yeah it's weird a
[54:29] lot of my injuries i've just pushed
[54:31] through and they've uh
[54:32] i duct tape it up i mean have you ever
[54:34] had to have surgery on any of them no
[54:36] just heart just a couple heart surgeries
[54:37] but um none of my actual physical body
[54:40] and what was your heart surgery for
[54:41] again you talked about this before yeah
[54:42] asd i had a hole in my heart yeah so
[54:45] which is even more ridiculous yeah
[54:47] that's what we talked about that too man
[54:49] they uh they they took me off and
[54:51] studied me for a while
[54:52] so they realized that my god
[54:54] i shouldn't even be in the military i
[54:56] wasn't even qualified to be in the
[54:57] military at the hole in my heart
[54:59] you know let alone being special
[55:00] operations where you jumping on planes
[55:02] and stuff like that so i was i was lucky
[55:03] how'd they seal that up so they went in
[55:05] with a helix patch
[55:07] and um you know through my femoral
[55:09] artery femoral artery and they went
[55:11] through put a patch and they realized
[55:13] you know i missed like three or four
[55:14] years of a military career because this
[55:16] heart surgery wow yeah so i was i was
[55:19] off of jump status dive status i was
[55:22] just uh so that's what i talked about
[55:23] recruiting so much i i stayed in
[55:25] recruiting for like three or four years
[55:28] and um you know i became like a navy
[55:30] city recruiter when i was uh
[55:32] you know doing this for a while so i got
[55:34] extended there because the heart surgery
[55:35] and
[55:36] other than that you never had to have
[55:37] any other surgeries
[55:39] um no meniscus no nothing no no that's
[55:42] crazy no and i've had some
[55:44] jacked up injuries
[55:45] let's see how i grew up
[55:47] you know like i talked about in the book
[55:49] my dad didn't believe in taking me by
[55:50] the hospital
[55:51] like that's just how it was man it was
[55:53] it was barbarian stuff man but
[55:56] you know you learn to deal with it and
[55:58] you live it
[55:59] you're fine you get hurt mris oh yeah
[56:01] get everything checked out matter of
[56:03] fact man i was terrified mri machine for
[56:04] a long time i was claustrophobic
[56:07] i was like man that's
[56:10] yeah there's a lot of there's a lot
[56:11] behind that man but yeah i've i've been
[56:13] checked out a lot i've had uh
[56:14] so like i said like six years ago i
[56:16] started stretching out like i thought i
[56:18] was dying i couldn't even get out of bed
[56:20] so all that stretching out was from
[56:22] pretty much all these injuries i had
[56:25] that i never really fixed
[56:26] and my body got knotted up and more
[56:28] knotted up and more knowledge i mean
[56:29] it's going to heal
[56:31] one way or another it's going to heal
[56:32] and when it heals and i can heal right
[56:34] it's going to heal all jacked up and
[56:35] crooked yeah so i'm a crooked jacked up
[56:37] dude man but i can still get it done
[56:41] it's amazing that you haven't had like
[56:43] knee surgeries or anything like that
[56:44] consider all the running you've done my
[56:46] left knee right now isn't it's no joke
[56:49] so like i say origin of pain
[56:51] my right foot is messed up because of my
[56:53] left knee
[56:54] so right now i'm i'm i'm taking care of
[56:56] my left knee knees getting a lot better
[56:57] now but
[56:58] don't worry cameron haynes i will still
[57:00] be [ __ ] out there running with your
[57:01] ass i'm not gonna get out of it buddy so
[57:03] if you're listening [ __ ] i will
[57:05] see you this weekend
[57:07] merry christmas
[57:08] all right just so you know brother merry
[57:10] christmas i'll see you soon
[57:12] you don't know what's wrong with the
[57:13] knee you have no idea it's from
[57:15] stretching so basically stretching yeah
[57:18] so my whole because my body was in in
[57:20] such bad alignment
[57:23] from just what i did to it
[57:25] that now i'm in this huge stress routine
[57:27] and my body's getting back into
[57:29] alignment so your muscles like i was a
[57:32] power lifter man like i i grew these
[57:34] huge muscles and i'm this small guy and
[57:36] i just and from the stress of my body
[57:38] going through three health weeks and
[57:39] also my body scout became one knot
[57:42] so as things start to open up
[57:44] joints start to hurt things start to
[57:46] hurt and i'm like god so it's been this
[57:47] big long process so i'm faster in better
[57:50] shape than ever
[57:51] my organs work better i'm healthier than
[57:53] ever but i have these little tweaks here
[57:56] these little tweaks there from the fact
[57:58] that i am now my body was locked into
[58:00] position
[58:01] from these muscles being so tight now
[58:03] what do you weigh now about 182 183 and
[58:05] you were at like 300 plus pounds when
[58:07] you're at your fattest right my fattest
[58:09] when i weighed in for the military i
[58:10] don't know what my fattest was but when
[58:12] i weighed in
[58:13] on that scale when steven sauzio hit
[58:15] that scale on me man it was 297.
[58:18] and he's like brother you gotta lose 106
[58:20] pounds i was like [ __ ] this
[58:24] what are you talking about
[58:25] oh how's that possible so anyway it's
[58:27] just you know not a lot of time that's
[58:29] the crazy thing they didn't give you
[58:30] three months to lose that 33 pounds a
[58:33] month is a lot of [ __ ] weight plus a
[58:36] few almost impossible and that's what i
[58:38] thought that's what i thought but see
[58:40] you see the person now i was 175 pounds
[58:42] in high school so i was a skinny guy in
[58:44] high school so i made myself big
[58:48] i'm a small bone person so it didn't it
[58:50] wouldn't trust me it was hard
[58:53] it was hardest thing i've ever done in
[58:55] my life
[58:56] but what did people think around you
[58:57] when they saw you three months later
[58:59] you're 100 pounds lighter my mom
[59:00] couldn't believe it because my mom so i
[59:02] was living in indianapolis in the end at
[59:03] the time
[59:04] and so i was
[59:06] trying to study for this asvab test
[59:07] again that you know i got to take it
[59:09] again going to the navy and i'm out here
[59:11] trying to lose weight and i'm you know
[59:12] working for this company spraying for
[59:14] cockroaches and all sort of crap and i
[59:15] would lay in her pond
[59:17] in [ __ ] november in indiana
[59:20] just lay in her pond i was like i'm
[59:22] going to bust i got to get hard you know
[59:24] so i would lay in the pond get out of
[59:25] the pond and go for a run
[59:27] just all wet cold like my like the dad
[59:29] gone shirt would just freeze up from ice
[59:31] and [ __ ] and i just be out there running
[59:33] said what is wrong with you man like you
[59:35] were that kid who just didn't want to
[59:37] like what's wrong with you so she
[59:38] started seeing the transformation like
[59:40] you know this guy is obsessed
[59:42] with trying to become somebody next
[59:43] thing she knew man
[59:45] my god you actually lost that much
[59:46] weight that fast i love the fact that
[59:49] you did it but what what hurts me is
[59:51] when i hear stories about people that
[59:53] get like stomach stapling and surgery
[59:56] and all that [ __ ] that they do like you
[59:58] just need to just lose the weight right
[01:00:00] and if you just did it you just did it
[01:00:02] the right way you would have earned it
[01:00:04] and if you earn it you'll keep it that's
[01:00:06] the thing about it man like we like to
[01:00:08] take these very quick fixes in life
[01:00:10] we want the six minute abs approach to
[01:00:12] life yeah nah man there's no permanent
[01:00:15] in that yeah there's no permanent in
[01:00:17] that man there's no scarring
[01:00:20] there must be scarring well people are
[01:00:21] terrified of this thing that you're
[01:00:23] saying that there's no end
[01:00:25] that there's no finish line that every
[01:00:26] day is a new thing that you have to earn
[01:00:28] it still after all the [ __ ] you've done
[01:00:30] every day you get up and you have to
[01:00:31] earn it yes you know what's funny about
[01:00:33] that
[01:00:34] i want you to be scared of it
[01:00:36] yeah i want you to just give you fuel
[01:00:39] it's great motivation and see if you
[01:00:41] look at that way
[01:00:42] the reason why
[01:00:45] i speak the way i speak because i
[01:00:46] believe in what i'm saying
[01:00:48] if i ever shut it down
[01:00:51] that's the end of me
[01:00:53] and whatever my hundred percent will be
[01:00:55] i don't know what's gonna happen to me
[01:00:56] tomorrow
[01:00:57] if you can't run i will figure what the
[01:01:00] [ __ ] i can do and do that
[01:01:02] that would be my new 100
[01:01:04] you must continue to find your new 100
[01:01:06] whatever life throws at you you must
[01:01:08] find what you can do now
[01:01:11] i may become the best you know
[01:01:13] scientist of all time who knows watch
[01:01:15] out you know what i'm saying
[01:01:16] watch out
[01:01:19] who knows well that is an approach like
[01:01:21] this this approach this mental approach
[01:01:23] you can use that for anything once you
[01:01:25] get past the quitting mechanism of your
[01:01:28] mind once you get past that thing that
[01:01:31] this is applicable you can you can take
[01:01:34] these lessons that you learn from these
[01:01:35] grueling runs yes losing 106 pounds in
[01:01:39] three months from all these different
[01:01:40] things of struggle you can take these
[01:01:42] lessons of struggle and you can apply
[01:01:44] them to anything yes i talk about it in
[01:01:47] my book here about
[01:01:49] that race i did that made seal training
[01:01:50] look like a like a child's play in
[01:01:52] ranger school that that first hundred
[01:01:54] miler i did write [ __ ] on myself and all
[01:01:56] kind of stuff
[01:01:57] that 19 hours it took me with no
[01:01:59] training
[01:02:01] i sum it up like this you're talking
[01:02:03] about struggle how you can put so much
[01:02:04] of life into struggle in that 19 hours
[01:02:08] i lived
[01:02:09] five years
[01:02:11] five years of struggle of happiness of
[01:02:13] of depression success failure in 19
[01:02:17] hours that's what's great about some of
[01:02:18] these things i do you get a a wide range
[01:02:21] of life
[01:02:22] in just 19 hours
[01:02:24] you know like when you get to like mile
[01:02:25] 50 in your mind saying we gotta get out
[01:02:27] of here man and then it gets like miles
[01:02:29] 60. okay we're feeling good you have all
[01:02:31] these highs and lows that you have to
[01:02:32] manage within this suck fest of 19 hours
[01:02:36] and that's what i get from a lot of
[01:02:37] these different things that human growth
[01:02:39] you know growth of the mind without
[01:02:41] friction there is no growth without
[01:02:42] friction there's no growth
[01:02:44] there's no growth and there's no
[01:02:47] satisfaction
[01:02:48] like there's no real like people want to
[01:02:50] sit around and rest but you don't really
[01:02:52] appreciate rest unless you earned it
[01:02:54] that's it and people get they think i'm
[01:02:56] the craziest person on the planet you
[01:02:59] are so far [ __ ] removed from that
[01:03:02] statement it's not even funny i was 290
[01:03:05] pounds twice in my life
[01:03:07] i do not like to do the things i do but
[01:03:10] to humongous satisfaction from doing it
[01:03:13] this humongous has facts from lacing
[01:03:14] your shoes up saying i don't really want
[01:03:16] to go for a run today
[01:03:18] and then running
[01:03:20] and then getting back and saying wow i
[01:03:21] did it i did it yeah and that's what
[01:03:23] it's about it's about these small steps
[01:03:25] to doing things you don't want to do you
[01:03:26] know jocko jocko william i know him yeah
[01:03:29] jocko's don't know him great but i know
[01:03:31] him i i know him pretty well he's he's
[01:03:33] awesome but every morning you look at
[01:03:35] that motherfucker's instagram he's got a
[01:03:37] picture of his watch at 4 30. he gets up
[01:03:40] at 4 30 every morning and he earns a
[01:03:42] sunrise that's good stuff it works out
[01:03:44] like a [ __ ] and then earns a
[01:03:45] sunrise that's good stuff but it's that
[01:03:47] thing like there's no end no it doesn't
[01:03:49] end and it's scary
[01:03:52] that is scary that's scary everybody
[01:03:54] wants that holding hands while the sun
[01:03:56] sets retirement you're walking off into
[01:03:58] the sunset the biggest question i get is
[01:04:00] so
[01:04:01] when did you rest
[01:04:04] when did you recover yeah
[01:04:06] and i don't want to scare people
[01:04:09] but the truth answer
[01:04:10] is i don't take any
[01:04:14] days off
[01:04:15] no days no days seven days a week seven
[01:04:17] days a week what is a normal day normal
[01:04:20] day for me a normal day so let's say a
[01:04:23] light day light day light day is at
[01:04:25] least a seven mile run
[01:04:28] i will
[01:04:30] every every four every other day so
[01:04:32] about four days a week um calisthenics
[01:04:34] plus gym workout so i don't do any gym
[01:04:36] workout without hitting pull-ups
[01:04:38] push-ups i call nickels and dimes so
[01:04:40] like five pull-ups ten push-ups or i'll
[01:04:43] go you know quarters
[01:04:45] and whatever like it's like 25 pull-ups
[01:04:47] or in like 50 push-ups so i have all
[01:04:48] these different things i messed up so
[01:04:50] i will do weights with calisthenics and
[01:04:54] every single night i stretch
[01:04:57] for at least every night i stretch for
[01:04:59] these two hours two hours every
[01:05:02] night
[01:05:03] every night
[01:05:04] so you stretch after you're done working
[01:05:06] out yeah so at night time usually i'll
[01:05:07] be either in a quiet room or i'll be
[01:05:10] watching tv or a good i love sports be
[01:05:13] watching the game and i'm on the floor
[01:05:14] man and that's what i do
[01:05:16] so you just stretch while you're doing
[01:05:17] stuff i stretch where i do stuff two
[01:05:19] hours a long ass time to stretch is this
[01:05:21] just because you're trying to correct
[01:05:23] i'm trying to correct um years of not
[01:05:25] doing that no years of just do you ever
[01:05:27] [ __ ] with yoga a lot yeah yoga is this
[01:05:30] [ __ ] what do you do
[01:05:31] i have my own yoga
[01:05:33] so i kind of invented my own little yoga
[01:05:34] for what my body needs i've done hot
[01:05:36] yoga several times yoga is huge yoga
[01:05:39] shoes like holding those positions and
[01:05:42] i'm big and holding them for a long
[01:05:44] period of time so that's where my
[01:05:45] stretching like people say don't hold
[01:05:46] stretches for a long time i hold them
[01:05:48] for a long period of time because i'm
[01:05:49] trying to get full range of motion a lot
[01:05:52] of people going for like like um like my
[01:05:54] shoulders all messed up i get surgery on
[01:05:56] it nah if you don't have full range of
[01:05:58] motion in your body don't go in and get
[01:06:00] cut on man until you know that your body
[01:06:02] is actually opened up you know we start
[01:06:04] to get knuckle dragger syndrome from
[01:06:07] doing these push-ups you never work your
[01:06:08] back you know like like i'm like i'm
[01:06:10] your rear delts
[01:06:12] so here you are you start hunching over
[01:06:15] before you know your joints are out of
[01:06:16] whack you need to get full range of
[01:06:18] motion before you know how [ __ ] up you
[01:06:20] truly are
[01:06:21] so i'm i'm always working on full range
[01:06:23] of motion like a kid they run so
[01:06:25] effortlessly they're always in full
[01:06:26] range of motion
[01:06:28] as you get older and tighter and sick
[01:06:30] and more stressed your body starts to
[01:06:32] get more and more tight therefore your
[01:06:34] shoulders start to get out of balance
[01:06:36] not a and not a joint not a socket
[01:06:37] therefore you know it's popping yeah
[01:06:40] it's popping because you're [ __ ]
[01:06:41] tight
[01:06:42] open it up first open it up can you can
[01:06:44] can you touch your hands behind each
[01:06:45] other and raise them up behind you you
[01:06:47] know it's all these different ranges of
[01:06:49] motion that i got real smart on from a
[01:06:51] guy and i took it to another level so
[01:06:53] are you do you work with a trainer or do
[01:06:55] you always work out by yourself
[01:06:56] everything i do i've never had training
[01:06:58] my entire life really never not one time
[01:07:01] do you read about physiology or exercise
[01:07:04] science or anything like that nothing
[01:07:06] nothing nothing but what about like when
[01:07:08] they learn new [ __ ] about new ways to
[01:07:11] you know enhance shoulder stability or
[01:07:13] new exercises you're not interested no i
[01:07:16] don't i don't i don't
[01:07:19] i don't do it for that reason
[01:07:21] still this day man still this day to
[01:07:24] this day
[01:07:25] it is for me
[01:07:27] to become better mentally
[01:07:30] how i look has just become
[01:07:33] like i have
[01:07:35] thousands thousands hundreds of
[01:07:37] thousands of miles on this body running
[01:07:40] pull-ups push-ups swimming whatever you
[01:07:42] want to call it this body is what it is
[01:07:43] now
[01:07:44] it's from repetition
[01:07:46] it's not from studying you know hey if
[01:07:48] you hold your plank for this long [ __ ]
[01:07:49] all that [ __ ] i don't i don't care
[01:07:51] about it
[01:07:52] i just do it for my mind right i want to
[01:07:55] continue to harden because that's the
[01:07:56] only thing i want
[01:07:58] that's what i want
[01:07:59] i want to have that mind ready for life
[01:08:01] but you also want to increase your range
[01:08:03] of motion oh yeah yeah range of motion
[01:08:05] make sure that you're you're you know
[01:08:07] you're not causing any additional
[01:08:08] injuries dude wouldn't you want to like
[01:08:10] stabilize some areas that maybe you feel
[01:08:12] like you might have weaknesses and find
[01:08:14] out new techniques to do that have you
[01:08:16] seen me with my shirt off
[01:08:17] no yeah it's stable as [ __ ]
[01:08:22] i saw you when you had your shirt off
[01:08:23] when you first came here i walked in he
[01:08:26] dave got here early and uh by the time i
[01:08:28] got here he was already doing chin-ups
[01:08:30] yeah it's stable
[01:08:31] stable do some pull-ups push-up smash
[01:08:33] some stable [ __ ] yeah but yeah but you
[01:08:35] you know all that stuff is very
[01:08:36] important honestly just all jokes aside
[01:08:38] man
[01:08:39] full range of motion getting your
[01:08:41] shoulder rotation all that stuff is very
[01:08:43] important i i learned a lot about that
[01:08:45] coming up i had a lot of people i worked
[01:08:47] out with that that are real smart about
[01:08:49] all this stuff
[01:08:50] i'm a real old-school meat-eater like
[01:08:52] bill casmire type of lifter you know i
[01:08:55] don't look like it back when i was that
[01:08:57] guy in the back of the skinny guy that
[01:08:58] that's what i did and i got off really
[01:09:01] big into human performance about the
[01:09:03] body strength fitness that's what i
[01:09:05] wanted to be i want to be a hybrid
[01:09:06] [ __ ] a guy that can run 200
[01:09:08] miles and then go to the gym with your
[01:09:11] meat head who doesn't even who's scared
[01:09:12] of running and lift with him
[01:09:15] so that's my whole thing in life i want
[01:09:16] to be the guy who can run 200 miles with
[01:09:18] the skinny guys
[01:09:19] and then go to the gym with the big meat
[01:09:20] head and say okay
[01:09:22] load it up let's go
[01:09:24] so that's my whole thing that's a very
[01:09:26] difficult thing to to tie the two of
[01:09:28] them together when you think most people
[01:09:30] when you think ultra marathon runners or
[01:09:32] people that run long distances they're
[01:09:33] very thin right very thin guys like when
[01:09:36] you were talking about the first time
[01:09:37] you ran 100 miles that you did deadlifts
[01:09:40] the night before
[01:09:41] like that is just [ __ ] preposterous
[01:09:43] nobody does that no yeah so me and the
[01:09:45] guy talk about the book
[01:09:47] it's silverback gorilla is what i call
[01:09:50] him in the book that's not his real name
[01:09:51] obviously but yeah he saw me go into my
[01:09:53] car the night before my first hundred
[01:09:55] mile race and you know i was like he
[01:09:56] called me out say hey
[01:09:58] goggins
[01:09:59] come here you know when the navy still
[01:10:02] calls you out gotta put you through
[01:10:03] three hell weeks you're like you know
[01:10:04] what [ __ ]
[01:10:05] i gotta go to the gym and lift heavy now
[01:10:07] so we're doing squats deadlifts power
[01:10:10] cleans heavy bench presses and i'm
[01:10:12] thinking
[01:10:13] i have to run 100 miles tomorrow but i
[01:10:15] also knew he was coming out there to
[01:10:17] watch me
[01:10:19] so i was like you know what
[01:10:20] you put me through three hell weeks you
[01:10:22] were my instructor so now it's my turn
[01:10:25] to educate you
[01:10:26] on what a human can do because i know
[01:10:28] you could be sitting there thinking
[01:10:29] while you're watching me with your wife
[01:10:31] and your kid and you just worked out
[01:10:33] with me not before we went real heavy
[01:10:35] did the heaviest [ __ ] when we're sore
[01:10:37] you're you're gonna sit there while you
[01:10:38] watch me run around this one mile track
[01:10:40] how the [ __ ] is he doing that [ __ ] right
[01:10:43] now
[01:10:43] we lifted heavy as hell and he's running
[01:10:46] 100 miles and never has run past 20
[01:10:48] miles in his life
[01:10:49] i use that for a lot of fuel so that gym
[01:10:52] workout
[01:10:53] mr silverback gorilla there was a lot
[01:10:56] for my mentality that that brought with
[01:10:58] me because i knew i would see you and he
[01:11:00] came at mile 50
[01:11:02] with a package of six donuts
[01:11:05] that i chomped up with the quickness
[01:11:09] so yeah so i used that workout for a lot
[01:11:10] of motivation i knew he'd see me i know
[01:11:12] he'd be thinking about how did you not
[01:11:13] get robbed over that day you know what i
[01:11:16] don't know what i got that day
[01:11:18] but i talked about in the book again
[01:11:21] that when i went home that night
[01:11:24] or that morning
[01:11:25] that was single-handedly nothing even
[01:11:28] close i'm 43 years old now there's
[01:11:30] nothing even close to that pain i knew
[01:11:33] for a fact
[01:11:35] i wasn't going to get out of that tub
[01:11:36] i knew i i knew i was done
[01:11:40] i was talk about dehydrated no nutrition
[01:11:42] i was eating rich crackers and my plex
[01:11:45] that was the worst pain i'd ever
[01:11:47] experienced in my entire life i was
[01:11:50] pissing coca-cola out of me it was bad
[01:11:53] it was bad she probably did have rob dog
[01:11:55] i guarantee it i i guarantee i'm pissing
[01:11:58] god cold that's coca-cola no bueno yeah
[01:12:01] no brain no son
[01:12:03] it was bad and my ex-wife was like
[01:12:06] [ __ ] and she's you know she's a nurse
[01:12:09] yeah and she called my mom up and mom
[01:12:11] had a her friend there was a was was a
[01:12:13] doctor friend of hers said hey
[01:12:15] you gotta give them to the doctor
[01:12:16] immediately and i was like hey you gotta
[01:12:17] give me that [ __ ] phone
[01:12:19] i gotta call up chris kaufman let him
[01:12:21] know i did 100 miles so i get in the bad
[01:12:23] water
[01:12:24] it didn't go as like you know like i
[01:12:26] planned but i did get in the bad water
[01:12:27] after another race but um but didn't you
[01:12:29] do a marathon like yes later so
[01:12:32] basically i had never run a marathon
[01:12:34] right i did the 100 mile race first no
[01:12:37] training
[01:12:38] but i had signed up for the marathon
[01:12:40] because it's the first las vegas
[01:12:41] marathon running down the strip of las
[01:12:43] vegas so las vegas had you know had a
[01:12:46] marathon but it's the first time it's
[01:12:48] going to go down the strip 2005 like hey
[01:12:50] i'm gonna sign up for it i went on to
[01:12:52] iraq did you know the deployment and i
[01:12:54] come back i'll be training for it and
[01:12:56] i'll go do this race with my family me
[01:12:58] my ex-wife and my mom signed up for it
[01:13:01] so in iraq me and my boy
[01:13:03] sledge in the book
[01:13:05] we're just working out we're like we're
[01:13:07] doing crazy workouts and my cardio was
[01:13:11] 20 minutes
[01:13:12] every sunday on the elliptical trainer
[01:13:15] that's the only cardio i did
[01:13:17] so i called myself training for this
[01:13:19] marathon right so then
[01:13:21] you know my my boys got killed in in
[01:13:24] that incident that happened long
[01:13:25] survivor you know the whole operation
[01:13:27] red wings
[01:13:28] so that's what prompted me to do the 100
[01:13:30] mile race
[01:13:31] after the 100 mile race in november it
[01:13:33] was like two or three weeks later that
[01:13:35] marathon that we all signed up for that
[01:13:37] i didn't train for i didn't train for
[01:13:38] 100 miles didn't doing training off of
[01:13:40] this
[01:13:40] like hey i'll drive there with you all
[01:13:43] because i tried to run the day before
[01:13:45] like i can't even run
[01:13:46] i can't run down the block so i didn't
[01:13:48] do it
[01:13:49] so we we're driving to the race i said
[01:13:51] hey mom my mom's going to walk it i said

[01:14:47] hundred miles no training
[01:14:48] like i'm broken most broken i've been in
[01:14:51] my life now i'm running a marathon who
[01:14:52] could do it so i started just feeding
[01:14:54] myself feeding myself i get to half the
[01:14:56] mile

[01:15:04] feeding myself feeding myself feeding
[01:15:06] myself you can do this before i knew it
[01:15:08] man
[01:15:09] i kept talking to like the last six
[01:15:10] miles and i was off the pace and i just
[01:15:12] kicked it and that next thing i knew i
[01:15:14] did like a 308 and change i was like
[01:15:17] and that was like what the [ __ ]
[01:15:19] what have i been leaving on the table
[01:15:21] right i've been leaving so much on the
[01:15:23] [ __ ] table
[01:15:25] for pain like and that's when i started
[01:15:27] like going crazy about the mind like
[01:15:30] what the hell am i like what is up
[01:15:33] like open these different doors of like
[01:15:36] possibility in like what is humanly
[01:15:39] possible what are we capable of like you
[01:15:41] know people
[01:15:42] i didn't even know i was just amazed by
[01:15:44] what i was able to do
[01:15:47] by a simple fact of just reasoning
[01:15:49] and working with pain and pain
[01:15:51] management and
[01:15:52] in my mind just kept on growing from
[01:15:54] there
[01:15:55] and it happened in hell week it happened
[01:15:57] a hundred mile race happened here it
[01:15:58] started just evolving into
[01:16:01] what it is now to where now i'm like god
[01:16:02] dawg man of mine we are leaving so much
[01:16:04] on the table but people take me
[01:16:06] he cusses so much she sounds crazy
[01:16:09] don't listen all that [ __ ] man just just
[01:16:11] cut off the [ __ ]
[01:16:13] cut the [ __ ] just get to the weeds
[01:16:15] of that you are you are [ __ ] yourself
[01:16:18] up by not
[01:16:19] examining
[01:16:20] your brain
[01:16:21] you're not examining your brain message
[01:16:24] it that's done
[01:16:25] you examine your [ __ ] brain and that
[01:16:27] takes some hard work and suffering
[01:16:29] if you're not willing to do that i'm
[01:16:31] sorry and it seems like there's no way
[01:16:32] to do that as a bystander no you can't
[01:16:35] watch it man yeah you gotta get out
[01:16:37] there like oh this hurts this hurts real
[01:16:39] [ __ ] bad
[01:16:40] i don't think this is smart
[01:16:42] and then guess what happens
[01:16:44] the body will adjust
[01:16:46] it will adjust anybody goes well then
[01:16:49] the next question i get but is there a
[01:16:51] time when it doesn't adjust
[01:16:54] what the [ __ ]
[01:16:56] i get some of the stupidest [ __ ] man
[01:16:58] like don't don't take it with a grain of
[01:17:00] [ __ ] salt people those questions are
[01:17:02] people that are wanting to quit yes yes
[01:17:04] and that's what i say when should i quit
[01:17:05] yeah like uh did you ever like feel like
[01:17:08] no shut the [ __ ] up
[01:17:09] stop stop i don't want to like that
[01:17:12] there's always that next question
[01:17:15] no don't take it like go out there and
[01:17:17] run through a brick wall as many times
[01:17:18] as you can no i'm not saying be me don't
[01:17:21] run 205 miles at one time i'm not saying
[01:17:23] do that i'm saying start to learn the
[01:17:27] mind is powerful
[01:17:28] it's powerful man it's it's unbelievable
[01:17:31] but people need they need a thing to get
[01:17:34] them going right they need a thing right
[01:17:37] they need a goal they need they need a
[01:17:40] like it's
[01:17:41] sometimes the first step is the hardest
[01:17:43] like it's hard to take that one million
[01:17:45] step too but sometimes the first step is
[01:17:47] the most there's something about the
[01:17:50] what do i do
[01:17:51] they start going over their phone
[01:17:53] they start calling people they don't get
[01:17:55] out of the house right
[01:17:57] and there's something about
[01:18:00] procrastination it's like you know it's
[01:18:02] painful you know you should be doing
[01:18:04] things but you just keep doing it you
[01:18:06] keep itching that scab
[01:18:07] [Laughter]
[01:18:09] i procrastinate like a [ __ ] man
[01:18:12] every day i'm gonna do this [ __ ]
[01:18:16] that's what's so funny man people
[01:18:17] looking like i'm some damn superhero
[01:18:19] that came down from the gods from the
[01:18:20] heavens of earth no man
[01:18:23] i don't want to do this [ __ ]
[01:18:26] i'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes
[01:18:28] sometimes thinking man
[01:18:31] [ __ ] man people people look up to you
[01:18:33] goggins [ __ ] them i don't wanna do this
[01:18:38] i'm like i wanna do this [ __ ] man but
[01:18:39] guess what you do it i'm gonna do it as
[01:18:41] long as you do it and that's what i know
[01:18:43] about it man that's why i stopped doing
[01:18:44] i'm thinking oh man you're gonna [ __ ]
[01:18:46] sit here you look at your shoes for 30
[01:18:47] 40 minutes
[01:18:49] you go you got to think about it all day
[01:18:50] long and you go do it anyway and
[01:18:52] sometimes you don't have the time to
[01:18:53] look at issues for 30 minutes no those
[01:18:55] are the those are the beautiful days yes
[01:18:57] because you know you just have to go
[01:18:58] that's right and so like there's no room
[01:19:00] for procrastination and that's when i
[01:19:02] was in the military i love my schedule
[01:19:04] because i knew how to work at seven
[01:19:05] o'clock so you better get your ass up at
[01:19:08] four o'clock man you get your [ __ ] in
[01:19:09] brother cause i had to get my [ __ ] in
[01:19:11] before i got my [ __ ] in right you know
[01:19:13] so that was my mentality back then man
[01:19:15] you know like i i had to
[01:19:17] get the miles and get everything in man
[01:19:19] and
[01:19:20] and get to work man i'm uh competing
[01:19:22] with the alpha males yeah but how much
[01:19:24] did that piss other alpha males off that
[01:19:27] you were you were imposing a very high
[01:19:29] bar i
[01:19:32] i was a very misunderstood human being
[01:19:35] when i was in the military the air force
[01:19:37] guys liked me a lot the rangers liked me
[01:19:40] a lot
[01:19:41] so much not the seals because they were
[01:19:43] with you they they didn't like me so
[01:19:45] much which is fine you know i i respect
[01:19:48] them i think a lot of them respect i've
[01:19:49] have a lot of friends in the seal teams
[01:19:50] a lot of guys that like like-minded
[01:19:52] mentalities as me
[01:19:54] and once again i grew up and i got over
[01:19:56] it a lot of guys still have you know
[01:19:58] like a lot of people can't get over the
[01:19:59] fact of whatever when i became a seal
[01:20:01] recruiter
[01:20:02] a lot of guys thought i wasn't deploying
[01:20:04] for a lot of reasons and whatnot and
[01:20:05] they
[01:20:06] i heard a lot i was that guy who grinded
[01:20:10] i grinded hard
[01:20:11] i mean i i grounded hard i was that guy
[01:20:14] who was up like if we went on an op or
[01:20:17] we had a
[01:20:18] work up let's say we had a work up we're
[01:20:20] an island we're out there shooting guns
[01:20:22] and and doing land warfare and we did it
[01:20:24] like one o'clock in the [ __ ] morning
[01:20:27] most everybody go to sleep
[01:20:30] i didn't go to sleep i went to the gym
[01:20:33] and i worked out
[01:20:34] or i'd go sleep and i said we'd be up at
[01:20:36] five o'clock i was up at four o'clock
[01:20:38] and got my hour in
[01:20:39] i made sure to always do that
[01:20:41] and i i did it to a point to where i
[01:20:44] think it pissed some people off because
[01:20:45] i i want a quiet person about it
[01:20:48] you know i i uh
[01:20:50] i want the most humble person always
[01:20:53] you know so when you're around alpha
[01:20:55] males
[01:20:56] um you're sometimes picking a fight
[01:20:58] you know all the time and i looked
[01:21:00] different i acted different i was
[01:21:01] different i am different i take a lot of
[01:21:03] pride in that
[01:21:04] and so you know if if you didn't get
[01:21:06] after it i didn't respect you
[01:21:08] because i believe that you know where
[01:21:11] where i'm at
[01:21:12] i i know that human potential is what we
[01:21:14] have it's all we have is what we the the
[01:21:17] world sees us a certain way
[01:21:20] and when i saw that people weren't doing
[01:21:22] that i had a funky ass [ __ ] attitude
[01:21:25] and i i own it in my book i come back
[01:21:28] from ranger school a big time leader i
[01:21:30] was a big time [ __ ] leader i got
[01:21:31] honor man out there i live by example
[01:21:34] and what i realized a lot of times when
[01:21:36] you're in these schools
[01:21:38] these schools people want to graduate
[01:21:40] these schools because they suck they
[01:21:42] don't want to ever go back to these
[01:21:43] schools
[01:21:45] those schools became my [ __ ] life
[01:21:48] people don't want to see a [ __ ] god
[01:21:50] that wants to go back to day one week
[01:21:52] one a [ __ ] navy still training every
[01:21:53] [ __ ] day of your life and that's how
[01:21:56] i live
[01:21:57] and it's a disgusting human being that i
[01:21:59] can be
[01:22:01] it is and a lot of people didn't like me
[01:22:04] a lot of [ __ ] people started some
[01:22:05] stupid [ __ ] and started saying this and
[01:22:07] that the bottom line man is my [ __ ]
[01:22:09] resume says it all man
[01:22:11] my resume is out there google the
[01:22:12] [ __ ] you say whatever you want
[01:22:14] to say about me man
[01:22:15] i i i miss some deployments man for
[01:22:17] having [ __ ] you know two heart
[01:22:19] surgeries and
[01:22:20] people trying to start some rumors [ __ ]
[01:22:21] on me man you started rumors [ __ ] on me
[01:22:23] man because i [ __ ] got the [ __ ] after
[01:22:25] it and real hard guys
[01:22:27] like a guy named hawk i talked to all
[01:22:28] the time
[01:22:30] yeah
[01:22:30] he's a great friend of mine when the
[01:22:32] hardest my first
[01:22:33] before my heart surgery my second heart
[01:22:34] surgery i went on a 10 mile wreck around
[01:22:36] before my second heart rate the day of
[01:22:37] it
[01:22:38] i went on a 10 mile work on 50 pounds
[01:22:40] i saw that guy he's like what the [ __ ]
[01:22:42] are you doing out here he got heart
[01:22:43] surgeon it's roger that brother
[01:22:45] i'm getting it in before i'll be out for
[01:22:47] about six months after the heart surgery
[01:22:48] that was my mentality because i started
[01:22:50] realizing at a young age
[01:22:52] when i was leaving on the table
[01:22:54] and once i found out what a human
[01:22:55] being's capable of
[01:22:57] i didn't know how to control that
[01:23:00] i was i was a [ __ ] talk about [ __ ]
[01:23:02] savage
[01:23:03] that's what i was i was a [ __ ]
[01:23:05] straight up people talk about savage
[01:23:06] very lightly
[01:23:07] i was [ __ ] from the back woods
[01:23:09] [ __ ] savage dude you know and
[01:23:12] and i just i was just i was
[01:23:14] i told you what i thought i i had eight
[01:23:17] chips on my shoulder
[01:23:19] i um
[01:23:21] and a lot of times that wasn't great so
[01:23:23] is it a situation where like with the
[01:23:25] seals where once you've gotten through
[01:23:27] buds and once you've gotten through all
[01:23:29] the physically grueling parts of
[01:23:32] getting to be accepted once you're in
[01:23:35] then you were imposing standards that
[01:23:38] they didn't want to
[01:23:39] they didn't want to keep up with i i
[01:23:41] would say some people you know i i had
[01:23:43] uh i had one platoon that i had a
[01:23:45] problem with you know like i like i i i
[01:23:48] graduated ranger school and i got in
[01:23:50] this platoon and i didn't see i don't
[01:23:51] know i was in charge of a pt program
[01:23:54] and you put me in charge of the pt
[01:23:55] program it's [ __ ] your ass
[01:23:57] and the thing about it i didn't like it
[01:23:59] either i didn't i didn't want to do this
[01:24:01] [ __ ] either man but what were you making
[01:24:02] them do like you know like i it was it
[01:24:04] was some maybe it was some bud [ __ ] you
[01:24:06] know we went back to buzz like you know
[01:24:08] long peak tees and carrying logs over
[01:24:10] the berms and [ __ ] and like i had us do
[01:24:12] like pull-ups rope climbs pull up like
[01:24:15] for like a [ __ ] hour so imagine doing
[01:24:17] a rope climb then go do like 10 to 15
[01:24:20] pull-ups coming back
[01:24:21] and we would do like these they were
[01:24:23] very hard workouts like there was no
[01:24:25] like go to the gym lift some weights
[01:24:27] type of [ __ ]
[01:24:28] and i was imposing
[01:24:31] my own mentality on everybody these are
[01:24:34] grown ass [ __ ] men they know you know
[01:24:35] they don't want to be what i'm trying to
[01:24:37] make them to be
[01:24:38] and when they called me off
[01:24:40] like hey you know we're not in sealed
[01:24:42] you know we're not in buds anymore
[01:24:44] goggins it pissed me off
[01:24:46] and i uh and i got a little [ __ ]
[01:24:47] attitude got my chip and i got my ball
[01:24:49] and
[01:24:50] me me and sledge went ahead and started
[01:24:52] to work out together
[01:24:54] and we developed this like me and sleds
[01:24:56] work out like [ __ ] girl animals and
[01:24:58] we had this [ __ ] mentality of [ __ ]
[01:24:59] yeah we're getting answered every day
[01:25:02] and everybody's kind of did their own
[01:25:03] thing man
[01:25:04] and i just that's when i started looking
[01:25:06] at people you know not just but people
[01:25:08] very differently man cause i bit into
[01:25:10] like
[01:25:11] you know like to be the special operator
[01:25:13] you gotta be have broken legs and these
[01:25:14] guys all those stories i was the same
[01:25:17] guy man i i put people on a pedestal
[01:25:20] i put people like i could never be them
[01:25:23] i could never be that guy man never put
[01:25:25] anybody on a pedestal that's what
[01:25:26] happened to me i put him on a pedestal
[01:25:28] once i got up there with him and i saw
[01:25:29] him and once again not everybody some
[01:25:32] hard [ __ ] out there dude period
[01:25:34] dot hard [ __ ]
[01:25:36] i thought every [ __ ] was hard
[01:25:39] hey
[01:25:40] hey
[01:25:41] uncommon amongst uncommon men
[01:25:44] that's all it was about for me man and i
[01:25:46] took it to another level and i pissed a
[01:25:47] lot of [ __ ] off
[01:25:49] and they were trying to find chinks in
[01:25:51] my armor then they were they were trying
[01:25:53] to find chinks in the armor
[01:25:54] you know all he does is run
[01:25:56] all he does is [ __ ] run
[01:25:58] that's why you know but once again i
[01:26:00] don't talk about the military too much
[01:26:02] like i said the air force loved me
[01:26:04] the army guys i work with love me the
[01:26:05] ranger school all that stuff love me you
[01:26:08] know i wasn't you know it's just what it
[01:26:10] is man it's uh i was part of the navy
[01:26:12] seals
[01:26:13] i was a i was a team guy
[01:26:16] but i wasn't part of the brotherhood
[01:26:18] and that's just me man that's just me it
[01:26:20] ain't saying nothing bad about them i
[01:26:22] got a lot of love for a lot of them
[01:26:24] love them a lot ain't got love for me
[01:26:26] but i'm gonna talk bad about them it's
[01:26:28] just i'm different that's something i
[01:26:30] figured out i'm different from everybody
[01:26:32] in the [ __ ] world
[01:26:34] and i had to own that and say you know
[01:26:36] what man you made a lot of [ __ ]
[01:26:37] mistakes being it's uh
[01:26:39] being who you are
[01:26:40] and i should have been more of a leader
[01:26:41] at times but a lot of times a lot of
[01:26:43] people should have been a little bit
[01:26:44] harder too
[01:26:45] so was it that some of those guys just
[01:26:47] didn't want to work as hard or was it
[01:26:49] just that they were they weren't
[01:26:50] appreciating how competitive you were
[01:26:52] you were always against them is that
[01:26:54] what it was that it didn't foster the
[01:26:56] sense of brotherhood because you were
[01:26:58] more like come on [ __ ]
[01:27:00] i i i didn't really call them [ __ ]
[01:27:02] but you could look at my face and how i
[01:27:03] looked at you
[01:27:04] and you know you can you can kind of say
[01:27:06] this you know so what happens i started
[01:27:08] developing this like this separation
[01:27:11] another thing about me too man i don't
[01:27:13] go out
[01:27:14] i don't party i don't hang out with the
[01:27:16] guys i don't you know so
[01:27:18] i was always forming this kind of
[01:27:20] separation i'm a big time introvert you

[01:27:29] we'll see you again you know you're in a
[01:27:31] platoon with these guys for two two
[01:27:32] years sometimes year and a half

[01:27:36] [ __ ] and i i'm just i'm just a different
[01:27:39] [ __ ] cat i'm a different cat man like
[01:27:41] i uh
[01:27:43] you know i just i i think differently i
[01:27:45] i believe differently
[01:27:47] um
[01:27:48] and i i believe strongly what i believe
[01:27:50] in well some people must appreciate the
[01:27:52] fact that you were self-motivated and
[01:27:54] that you were pushing the envelope that
[01:27:56] you were pushing the pace you were
[01:27:57] setting a high bar yeah i have a lot of
[01:27:59] guys right now within the community a
[01:28:01] lot of a lot of guys once again this is
[01:28:04] like
[01:28:05] it's like a big soap opera sometimes man
[01:28:07] when you know when we when you're in a
[01:28:09] fraternity like that that's what it's
[01:28:11] like man so i had to get a different
[01:28:13] vantage point look at it and see like
[01:28:15] you know a lot of guys did respect who i
[01:28:17] was and what i did
[01:28:19] and um i i brought it [ __ ] hard a lot
[01:28:22] and every day

[01:28:40] how much you were leaving on the table
[01:28:42] because that is um
[01:28:44] i mean i think
[01:28:46] the the unfulfilled potential is the
[01:28:48] story of most people's lives
[01:28:50] it is
[01:28:51] it is it and it could have been the
[01:28:52] story of mine
[01:28:54] and i tell a lot of people people go
[01:28:55] what's your biggest fear in life
[01:28:59] and my biggest fear honestly was
[01:29:02] let's say this let's say uh i don't care
[01:29:03] if you believe in god or not i don't
[01:29:05] care so this let's just play a game with

[01:30:02] you were supposed to be
[01:30:04] and my biggest fear i i visualize some
[01:30:08] crazy [ __ ] my biggest fear is that one
[01:30:10] day i want to reach a judgment of my
[01:30:12] life
[01:30:13] someone something is going to judge me
[01:30:15] what the [ __ ] i was supposed to be in
[01:30:16] life

[01:30:25] and them up there right now
[01:30:27] getting their pin out

[01:30:33] you're you know you know time you're
[01:30:34] born time you're dead i want this person
[01:30:36] up there to be like this up there
[01:30:38] writing more about me saying [ __ ] i know
[01:30:40] i know you could do that i i know you
[01:30:42] can do that so i want to impress
[01:30:45] whatever the [ __ ] is up there whatever's
[01:30:48] going on in life i want to go up there
[01:30:50] and not have anything left on the table
[01:30:52] i want to i want to drain my soul of
[01:30:54] every [ __ ] bit
[01:30:57] of person i am now how do you plan on
[01:30:59] doing that but going forward in the
[01:31:01] future do you have a plan yeah so what i
[01:31:03] did i i believe in going back to scratch
[01:31:06] so a lot of us like right now i've i've
[01:31:08] come a long way in my life i've had to
[01:31:10] grow up a lot except a lot of the
[01:31:12] [ __ ] things i've done in my life i'd
[01:31:13] accept a lot i took all this information
[01:31:16] big database took it all
[01:31:18] so what got me to be where i'm at today
[01:31:20] is data
[01:31:22] i collect even more data now which way i
[01:31:23] can write this book which i can tell
[01:31:25] people hey
[01:31:26] you know i [ __ ] have a lot of faults
[01:31:28] i have a mentality that can sometimes
[01:31:30] rub people all this [ __ ]
[01:31:32] so how you get better is so right now
[01:31:34] i'm way up here now i was way down here
[01:31:37] but what makes you way up here is
[01:31:39] being from way down here so i love going
[01:31:42] back i called so when i was growing up
[01:31:44] for like three years
[01:31:45] so from time i was eight to time i was
[01:31:47] like 12
[01:31:48] we live in a seven dollar a month place
[01:31:51] and what i call it is i'm always paying
[01:31:53] rent
[01:31:54] in that seven dollar a month home
[01:31:56] every day of my life i go back and
[01:31:58] revisit that place because that place
[01:32:00] made me
[01:32:01] this geranimal that place made me this
[01:32:04] hard man and then from that place so
[01:32:06] that that place is hard work
[01:32:08] that place is going back to the
[01:32:10] fundamentals of life the fundamentals
[01:32:12] what made david gaga's david goggins
[01:32:14] going back in there going back to the
[01:32:16] going back to the library of david
[01:32:18] goggins studying even more than what i
[01:32:20] know taking that out going back to where
[01:32:22] i'm at now and then moving forward
[01:32:24] so i believe in always taking steps
[01:32:26] backwards to to your roots we we cannot
[01:32:28] forget the roots and what made us the
[01:32:31] geranimal we can never become civilized
[01:32:33] isn't it granite that like little kids
[01:32:34] clothes it's a little kid's clothes but
[01:32:36] i love the word
[01:32:38] i love his clothes or drinks
[01:32:42] i don't know his clothes or drinks man
[01:32:43] but something like that
[01:32:45] so
[01:32:45] when when you when you're living like
[01:32:48] right now like what kind of goals are
[01:32:50] you setting and how how are you how are
[01:32:52] you how are you feeding that beast
[01:32:53] inside of you how are you calming all
[01:32:55] that down
[01:32:57] stretching helped a lot you know so when
[01:32:59] you wire yourself up so much yoga
[01:33:02] yoga and stretching has really helped me
[01:33:04] to like
[01:33:05] you want to be quiet in your mind
[01:33:07] to see where you want to go because
[01:33:08] noise
[01:33:09] is the ultimate kryptonite
[01:33:12] too much noise in your mind you're not
[01:33:14] going to be focused on what the task at
[01:33:15] hand is it's one of the things that i
[01:33:17] found like long cardio so the best thing
[01:33:19] ever for calming that noise yes we all

[01:33:37] [ __ ] nothing bothers you like nothing

[01:34:08] always it was negative anger the guy who
[01:34:11] cut you off yesterday oh yeah all day
[01:34:13] still on your head yep all day long man
[01:34:16] chatter challenge
[01:34:17] maybe i should do this maybe i should
[01:34:18] have done that i should never let that
[01:34:20] guy get away with that exactly i should
[01:34:21] have done this i should have taken that
[01:34:22] job oh i should have moved i should have
[01:34:25] stuck with her
[01:34:27] all that
[01:34:28] that was me man yeah that was my people
[01:34:30] yeah why don't people like me
[01:34:33] amazing that that long cardio just calms
[01:34:35] that chatter like that though yes like i
[01:34:37] i never uh until october i've never
[01:34:39] really done long cardio every day it
[01:34:42] beats that testosterone up man beats
[01:34:44] everything up yeah that test you're like
[01:34:46] [ __ ] done yeah you're cool yeah
[01:34:48] you're cool man it's not just that it's
[01:34:50] like it's i always talk about people's
[01:34:52] brains that i think that the the way
[01:34:54] people's minds work that we're like a
[01:34:56] battery that's like leaking out it's
[01:34:59] like since we don't use it because we
[01:35:01] have all this potential we don't use it
[01:35:04] like it oozes off the top of the batter
[01:35:06] and it gets messy right it's going down
[01:35:08] the sides of the battery it's all [ __ ]
[01:35:09] up but when you just drain that [ __ ]
[01:35:12] like nature intended like give you the
[01:35:16] potential to run away from predators
[01:35:18] avoid invading tribes and to fight and
[01:35:23] gather and hunt and all the physical
[01:35:26] potential that your body is capable of
[01:35:28] when you do drain it with like a 10 mile
[01:35:30] run or right long cardio session long
[01:35:33] workout session
[01:35:34] then you can just be you it's the great
[01:35:36] purge man the purge it's the purge you
[01:35:39] purge all that [ __ ] demon [ __ ] out
[01:35:40] man all the evil
[01:35:42] evil can't stay in a 10 mile run bro
[01:35:45] it's going to get leaked right the [ __ ]
[01:35:46] out it does it gets pounded out pound it
[01:35:48] out yeah but you could see things clean
[01:35:50] more clearly and that is only available
[01:35:53] through effort i mean maybe it's
[01:35:54] available through meditation i don't
[01:35:56] know but i feel like there's a different
[01:35:58] thing that's available through effort
[01:35:59] because there's also a satisfaction of
[01:36:00] accomplishment oh yeah effort's huge man
[01:36:03] it means everything
[01:36:05] because you gotta feel good about
[01:36:06] yourself now what do you do you plan out
[01:36:08] your future
[01:36:10] i do so i'm very go so i have that
[01:36:13] accountability mirror but i also plan on

[01:40:30] you're really doing woodland
[01:40:31] firefighting because there's no glory in
[01:40:33] that no sir no there's no fame there's
[01:40:36] no there's no one taking pictures of you
[01:40:38] no and that paycheck is small son
[01:40:42] i'mma [ __ ] make you wanna
[01:40:44] should i eat today yeah wow yeah there's
[01:40:48] there's nothing involved in that man
[01:40:49] they worked their ass off so but you're
[01:40:51] just doing it as a challenge that's it
[01:40:53] did they freak out when you're there you
[01:40:55] know what i i think they're wondering
[01:40:57] why is a 43 year old retired man
[01:41:00] you know
[01:41:01] all the stuff you've done why are you
[01:41:03] out here yeah and i explain it to them
[01:41:05] i'm out here i'm out here you know to to
[01:41:06] learn from you all to grow
[01:41:09] and also to never forget where i came
[01:41:11] from
[01:41:12] you know
[01:41:13] that's where it starts
[01:41:15] it's that mentality of i'm gonna pick up
[01:41:17] that [ __ ] pulaski and i'm gonna dig
[01:41:20] this [ __ ] fire line for three damn
[01:41:21] miles
[01:41:22] that's that mentality i never want to
[01:41:24] lose i never want to get so nice oh yeah
[01:41:28] i did it man
[01:41:30] i did it
[01:41:31] i did it i'm good
[01:41:33] that mentality of i'm willing to pick up
[01:41:35] that shovel and i'm willing to dig a
[01:41:36] three-mile line
[01:41:38] is th there's something about that
[01:41:39] mentality that i'm ready to go to work
[01:41:41] at any time and that's what keeps me
[01:41:44] those are the sparks like you know i
[01:41:45] look at
[01:41:46] motivation as just a spark it's like
[01:41:48] it's like kindling you know how how a
[01:41:50] big fire starts it starts with a little
[01:41:51] smoke it starts with a little cigarette
[01:41:53] being thrown in the woods next thing all
[01:41:55] californians [ __ ] burn up
[01:41:58] that's what i've been doing my whole
[01:42:00] life is i find these little sparks
[01:42:02] and once that little thing takes off
[01:42:04] that's a that's a one hour fuel then
[01:42:06] you've got 10 hour fuel
[01:42:07] then you can move that thing to a 10 000
[01:42:10] hour fuel
[01:42:12] these big logs and big trees that burn
[01:42:14] for days and that's where you want to
[01:42:15] bring that motivation that's where you
[01:42:17] want to bring that drive so if you have
[01:42:19] no kingling the kindling is me going out
[01:42:22] with these young guys saying all right
[01:42:23] [ __ ] you're 43. it's a 20 year
[01:42:25] old keep up with them
[01:42:27] that kindling now when i leave those
[01:42:29] young guys it has now become that ten
[01:42:32] hour fuel and now that ten thousand
[01:42:34] dollar fuel that i use throughout my
[01:42:36] whole life
[01:42:37] i use that there my whole life man hey
[01:42:39] this summer at 43 you went out there and
[01:42:40] you did that man so you know you're not
[01:42:42] giving up yet you're not done yet not
[01:42:44] today you're not done today that's a
[01:42:46] crazy choice to make though woodland
[01:42:48] firefighter is a very interesting choice
[01:42:50] it is
[01:42:51] it is it's a nasty job man because again
[01:42:53] that's
[01:42:54] that's proof of concept
[01:42:56] like you're really just doing just for
[01:42:59] the struggle that's it is there other
[01:43:01] things you considered like that
[01:43:04] um so i will i apply for smoke jumping
[01:43:07] this year
[01:43:08] so i'll be out smoke jumping this year
[01:43:09] you know god willing
[01:43:12] um
[01:43:13] that's where it's at now that that right
[01:43:15] now is my next military
[01:43:17] that's my next military
[01:43:19] and that's it's always about human
[01:43:21] growth it's not about money it's not
[01:43:23] about money human growth that's the
[01:43:25] biggest like i said my biggest trophy
[01:43:27] that's why i turn down 300 thousand
[01:43:28] dollars
[01:43:29] the biggest trophy in life is what i've
[01:43:31] learned like this brain if i could put
[01:43:33] this brain in somebody's head and say
[01:43:34] here you go merry christmas
[01:43:35] they'd be a happy person what i found
[01:43:38] out is that with no crowds
[01:43:41] no one cheering for you
[01:43:43] no races no finish line
[01:43:45] it's an amazing amazing thing i've
[01:43:47] learned in my mind by no one cheering
[01:43:50] you on like
[01:43:51] like what that is is every morning i do
[01:43:53] what i do
[01:43:54] i don't have a trainer waking me up
[01:43:57] there's no one saying david you have to
[01:43:59] do this
[01:44:00] i don't have to do anything anymore i've
[01:44:02] done it
[01:44:03] that's the beauty of all this knowing
[01:44:06] that everything i talk about no one even
[01:44:08] knows what the [ __ ] i'm doing every day
[01:44:10] and i know that i am grinding like a
[01:44:13] [ __ ] they see a one minute video

[01:44:24] [ __ ] day and no one sees what the
[01:44:26] [ __ ] i'm doing
[01:44:28] no one it's a great beautiful thing man
[01:44:31] that is a beautiful thing about it right
[01:44:33] that you really are just doing it for
[01:44:35] the benefits of it that's it that you
[01:44:37] have to do it that way it's not for show
[01:44:39] like there's a lot of people like you'll
[01:44:40] see like they have a little video they
[01:44:42] do on instagram like [ __ ] you are not

[01:45:28] me man i got some [ __ ] for these people
[01:45:29] man so that's what happens like usually
[01:45:31] when i'm working out
[01:45:32] i get this great inspiration
[01:45:34] i
[01:45:35] some people might think it's [ __ ]
[01:45:36] but
[01:45:37] my my mind works best
[01:45:39] under extreme pain and suffering like oh
[01:45:41] my god i want to be out here and that's
[01:45:43] when i'm going deep into the cellar of
[01:45:45] my mind and that's when all that
[01:45:47] gargoyle [ __ ] starts to come up man you
[01:45:48] know what i'm saying
[01:45:50] and so
[01:45:51] she gets called out all the time like

[01:49:17] let's put the shoes on and get grinding
[01:49:20] you do get some of that though there's
[01:49:21] some comments that say you know this is
[01:49:23] terrible advice rest and recovery is the
[01:49:25] most important thing god
[01:49:31] you ain't all my [ __ ] son
[01:49:33] you're not gonna last no my sight yeah i
[01:49:36] wanna hear that [ __ ] there's a lot of
[01:49:37] people looking for built-in excuses they
[01:49:39] are man they are
[01:49:41] they're looking for it but then there's
[01:49:42] a lot of people also that are just
[01:49:44] really interested in
[01:49:46] personal growth they're they're
[01:49:48] interested in really finding out what
[01:49:49] they're made of they're interested in
[01:49:51] improving their ability to toughen up
[01:49:54] and discipline themselves and they're
[01:49:55] looking they're looking for people like
[01:49:57] you and other people just add to that
[01:49:59] momentum right once you get going it's
[01:50:01] easier to keep going that's it man once
[01:50:03] you get going it's easier to keep
[01:50:04] showing up it is it is you have to get
[01:50:06] past that hurdle yeah and once you get
[01:50:08] past it man you're flying and then you
[01:50:10] see other people that are doing it too
[01:50:11] and you realize like this is a this is a
[01:50:13] movement there's a lot of other people
[01:50:14] out there it is a movement yeah it is a
[01:50:17] movement well that's the thing that
[01:50:18] resonates with you i think about the
[01:50:20] audience of this podcast that i've had
[01:50:22] quite a few people on that have that
[01:50:24] same message and it resonates with
[01:50:25] people because we're all trying to
[01:50:26] improve ourselves no one's perfect nope
[01:50:29] there's no i'm not perfect now i never
[01:50:31] will be you're not and you never will be
[01:50:34] but you're better than you were
[01:50:35] yesterday and you're gonna be better
[01:50:36] tomorrow that's the truth thing right
[01:50:37] there man that's that book says i am not
[01:50:40] [ __ ] perfect man i had the balls to
[01:50:42] now finally tell you all i am very
[01:50:44] flawed but in that saying that you're
[01:50:47] very flawed and saying that you're very
[01:50:48] perfect you exhibit way more strength
[01:50:50] than someone who bullshits and pretends
[01:50:52] right someone who puts up some fake ass
[01:50:54] [ __ ]
[01:50:55] fake facade of perfection right of moral
[01:50:59] integrity and growth and honesty and
[01:51:01] those people are a real problem because
[01:51:03] it's exhausting
[01:51:04] how the [ __ ]
[01:51:06] i did it for a while i'm like i can't
[01:51:08] hey i'm [ __ ] up
[01:51:10] i give up i quit i quit i quit i'm
[01:51:13] [ __ ] up i'm gonna tell you all i can't
[01:51:14] do this anymore this is who i am but the
[01:51:16] confidence of you of constantly grinding
[01:51:18] and constantly putting in that work is
[01:51:20] what leads you to be able to express
[01:51:22] yourself so honestly oh you're right i i
[01:51:25] for the first time believe in david
[01:51:26] goggins and i don't care who else
[01:51:28] believes in me i don't care for the
[01:51:30] first time in my life man i can tell you
[01:51:31] all my [ __ ] up [ __ ]
[01:51:33] and without lying that's powerful no
[01:51:35] longer care
[01:51:37] that's powerful that see everybody could
[01:51:39] get to that then you do you don't have
[01:51:41] any excuses because you don't need any
[01:51:42] that's right you don't need anything
[01:51:44] none you don't like me merry christmas
[01:51:48] [ __ ]
[01:51:49] kwanzaa keep moving that's it go yeah
[01:51:52] that's it good luck to you okay
[01:51:54] exactly yeah we're all in this thing
[01:51:56] together
[01:51:57] yeah you got your own path you didn't
[01:51:59] want us to stare at those shoes for 30
[01:52:00] minutes
[01:52:01] every day
[01:52:04] that's so true man that's so true
[01:52:07] so fire jumping and woodland
[01:52:09] firefighting i didn't expect that i
[01:52:11] didn't hear that coming yeah that's
[01:52:13] interesting man yep and what did you
[01:52:15] have any other options that you were
[01:52:16] looking at before you dived into those
[01:52:18] you know what those are the first that
[01:52:19] came up because i saw how hard it was
[01:52:21] you know like at 43 in these jobs like
[01:52:24] like in the military you're a dinosaur
[01:52:26] time to retire and while in firefighting
[01:52:29] you know you start to move into these
[01:52:30] desk jobs and that was the challenge of
[01:52:32] it you know i'm like i'm like a [ __ ]
[01:52:34] rookie at 43. right so i'm like being
[01:52:36] talked like a little [ __ ] so it takes a
[01:52:39] lot for me you know i'm like yeah i've
[01:52:42] done some things man hang on now but i
[01:52:44] have to now humble myself again right
[01:52:47] it's hard to humble yourself you got
[01:52:48] some 21 year old little punk ass [ __ ]
[01:52:50] saying hey
[01:52:51] pick up that [ __ ] and come on i'm like
[01:52:53] what what the [ __ ] you say i'm like you
[01:52:55] know but i'm like okay god it's like
[01:52:56] you're rookie man like so that's all the
[01:52:58] training behind the mindset of it all
[01:52:59] right is that
[01:53:01] you can't ever be the point you never
[01:53:03] learn from people right you know you
[01:53:05] have to always humble yourself and go
[01:53:07] back to that yeah you know like right
[01:53:08] now there's people listening this
[01:53:09] podcast like oh yeah you're great guys
[01:53:11] no you ain't [ __ ] goggins
[01:53:13] and that's the mindset i always want to
[01:53:15] have not like i'm not proud of myself
[01:53:17] but you have to always keep that like i
[01:53:19] want to keep that dog in me
[01:53:22] and i can't always know everything yeah
[01:53:24] well being a beginner at something is
[01:53:26] fantastic it's amazing being learning
[01:53:28] new things is fantastic for everything
[01:53:30] else so much growth in that have you do
[01:53:32] you [ __ ] around with martial arts
[01:53:34] you know what
[01:53:35] i learned a little bit
[01:53:37] i've i've never gone crazy in it i've
[01:53:39] never gone crazy i boxed a little bit
[01:53:41] where do you live i live in nashville
[01:53:43] there's a lot of jiu jitsu in nashville
[01:53:44] you should get involved in jiu jitsu you
[01:53:46] would take like a duck to water i'll
[01:53:48] find you a spot
[01:53:49] yeah hook me up i'll find you a spot you
[01:53:51] would you get obsessed with that [ __ ] oh
[01:53:53] god is that so yeah that's a
[01:53:54] never-ending pile of [ __ ] tangled
[01:53:58] bodies and strangled people here we go
[01:54:00] because it's something that you just get
[01:54:02] better at all the time and there's no
[01:54:04] hiding right either you get choked or
[01:54:06] you don't either you survive or you
[01:54:07] don't now i've been on a lot of ground
[01:54:09] i've been a lot of ground games man but
[01:54:11] i've never really learned the skill sets
[01:54:13] yeah so it'd be nice to do that i'll
[01:54:15] hook it up yeah please do i think you
[01:54:17] would get obsessed with it the same way
[01:54:18] jack was obsessed with it same with a
[01:54:20] lot of other
[01:54:21] seals get obsessed with martial arts it
[01:54:23] would be nice to do it because it's also
[01:54:25] constant competition as well i mean you
[01:54:27] can get into competition every single
[01:54:29] night of the week really and yeah
[01:54:31] absolutely and as a a guy who's just
[01:54:33] starting out you're going to be a white
[01:54:35] belt you're going to get strangled a lot
[01:54:36] you want to choke the [ __ ] out
[01:54:39] from the beginning you're going to start
[01:54:41] from the beginning 100
[01:54:42] there's plenty of guys your size there's
[01:54:44] plenty of guys that
[01:54:45] have been doing it for [ __ ] decades i
[01:54:47] know a lot of guys like to get their
[01:54:48] hands on me so i'll be good yeah oh
[01:54:50] goggins you're coming huh okay
[01:54:52] okay but it's also a good thing to have
[01:54:54] the kind of cardio and endurance you
[01:54:56] have too
[01:54:56] yeah that's where i get people so i've
[01:54:58] i've rolled with a lot of guys who have
[01:55:01] skills
[01:55:02] but the thing that i really have and i'm
[01:55:04] not gonna brag on it man is i got a
[01:55:06] [ __ ] up cardio bass man
[01:55:08] i got a [ __ ] up cardio bass man and my
[01:55:11] mentality is kind of [ __ ] up too yeah
[01:55:13] so i realized that we're fighting that
[01:55:15] if you get a big cardio base and your
[01:55:17] mindset's [ __ ] up too
[01:55:20] cardio is almost everything
[01:55:22] skills skills are everything because a
[01:55:24] lot of guys with skills also have some
[01:55:26] cardio they have enough to [ __ ] you up
[01:55:28] right but to have tremendous cardio
[01:55:31] with big skills is everything i see him
[01:55:33] out there man dying yeah because so many
[01:55:35] guys started 100
[01:55:37] but three minutes into the fight they're
[01:55:38] at 80. right you know five minutes into
[01:55:40] the fight they're at 60. that's right
[01:55:42] and then they recover for a minute they
[01:55:44] come back but if you're if you are in
[01:55:47] like a rolling session like when you
[01:55:48] roll you roll for nine minutes straight
[01:55:50] so you and this guy and you there's most
[01:55:53] of the time there's multiple taps right
[01:55:55] you'll tap him he'll tap you you tap
[01:55:57] each other but nine minutes man it is
[01:56:00] exhausting when that bell goes off the
[01:56:02] last you know the the the bell for 30
[01:56:04] seconds and you got 30 seconds left in
[01:56:07] nine minutes and then dinging it's over
[01:56:09] you're like
[01:56:10] you're done and then you take a minute
[01:56:12] off you find a new partner that's good
[01:56:14] [ __ ] get back in there you'd love it it
[01:56:16] sounds like a good grind yeah that's the
[01:56:17] next grind right there you love it yeah
[01:56:19] you blacked out hey so long that take
[01:56:22] about if i went like this hard at it
[01:56:25] it's hard to say because uh it depends
[01:56:28] entirely upon how much emphasis you put
[01:56:30] on learning new techniques and rolling
[01:56:32] and drilling drilling is gigantic and
[01:56:34] that's the thing that people don't like
[01:56:35] to do because jiu-jitsu is so fun people
[01:56:38] like to just roll right because it's
[01:56:40] sparring is where it's at like i don't
[01:56:42] want to do all those practice i want to
[01:56:43] choke people right like i knew a few
[01:56:45] things like do that okay and then i do
[01:56:47] this
[01:56:47] okay let me get in there now you want
[01:56:50] it's like a lot of uh jiu jitsu schools
[01:56:52] they'll start out with like one or two
[01:56:54] techniques and then you roll most of the
[01:56:56] class is just sparring right but the
[01:56:58] right way to do it really is to drill
[01:57:00] way more than you spar okay you should
[01:57:02] be drilling all the time and live
[01:57:04] drilling too like you start out where a
[01:57:06] guy has your back ready go and then from
[01:57:09] there you got to try to escape and do it
[01:57:11] the right thing to try to use the right
[01:57:12] technique to get out of that position or
[01:57:15] you'll start out
[01:57:16] uh with an arm bar but he's defending
[01:57:18] and you've got to figure out how to
[01:57:19] extend it you know and those live drills
[01:57:23] straight drills like technique drills
[01:57:24] and then live drills are i think even
[01:57:27] more important in the beginning
[01:57:29] to uh to to your personal development
[01:57:31] and growth as a jiu jitsu player than
[01:57:33] even sparring but a guy like you who's
[01:57:36] smart and tough and will go crazy
[01:57:38] [ __ ]
[01:57:40] it shouldn't take that long
[01:57:41] it takes people i mean it depends on how
[01:57:43] much you dedicate yourself to it right
[01:57:44] right b.j penn got his black belt in
[01:57:46] three years what yeah but it's crazy
[01:57:48] he's bj penn he's up like
[01:57:50] the prodigy for a reason right
[01:57:52] right i had a conversation with him
[01:57:54] about it though it was really
[01:57:55] interesting once
[01:57:56] he uh he goes uh he was talking to some
[01:57:59] other dude and the guy said uh i got my
[01:58:01] uh black belt at three years just like
[01:58:03] you did bj and he's like wow man he goes
[01:58:05] you must be good he goes no man he goes
[01:58:07] i'm addicted just like you he goes you
[01:58:10] were addicted you're addicted and he's
[01:58:12] like i never thought about it that way
[01:58:13] he goes yeah i'm addicted to jiu jitsu
[01:58:15] it's like you're addicted like it takes
[01:58:17] over your mind right it's everything
[01:58:19] your days are spent thinking about some
[01:58:21] guy who triangled you this [ __ ]
[01:58:23] how do you get me [ __ ]
[01:58:25] like i get that dude i got choked out
[01:58:27] ten years ago that i think about
[01:58:28] sometimes when i'm lifting i'll be tired
[01:58:30] and i'll think about a guy who caught me
[01:58:31] ten years i'm not like [ __ ] yeah just
[01:58:35] that's what's great about life man is i
[01:58:37] think about not being choked out by
[01:58:39] thinking about a lot of [ __ ] like that
[01:58:41] yeah little failures just keep you
[01:58:43] pushing they grind on me like a
[01:58:44] [ __ ] man and that's what you're
[01:58:46] talking about earlier too it's like the
[01:58:48] the the mind has these reserves you can
[01:58:50] trick it and pull them out yes these
[01:58:52] inspirational reserves like you did
[01:58:54] when when you when you guys were going
[01:58:56] through buds yes we just found that
[01:58:58] trigger and then all of a sudden you
[01:58:59] throw in that boat in the air the mind
[01:59:01] always has the tactical advantage over
[01:59:03] you
[01:59:04] why is that
[01:59:05] it knows your fears it knows your
[01:59:07] insecurities it knows where they're
[01:59:09] hiding you can't hide can't hide from
[01:59:10] that [ __ ] man
[01:59:12] that [ __ ] has a tactical
[01:59:14] advantage on you son that's gonna get
[01:59:16] you man
[01:59:17] it's a beast that might be your best
[01:59:19] lesson right that your mind your mind
[01:59:22] knows everything you cannot hide from it
[01:59:24] so don't ever try don't try you might as
[01:59:26] well go ahead and beat that [ __ ]
[01:59:28] gotta keep going at it that's also what
[01:59:29] you did in this book you didn't try to
[01:59:31] like
[01:59:32] paint yourself in a glamorous or
[01:59:34] flattering way at any point in time you
[01:59:36] were honest at every step of the way
[01:59:38] which i think is just gigantic for
[01:59:40] people too because
[01:59:42] you can tell when someone's stroking
[01:59:44] themselves or bullshitting themselves
[01:59:46] and the message just won't come through
[01:59:48] right but this you're you come through
[01:59:50] in this book you know like you who you
[01:59:52] are and what you became and how you
[01:59:54] became who you are and who you used to
[01:59:56] be and why you were the way you used to
[01:59:58] be all that comes through it's like
[02:00:00] there's no filter this is just your your
[02:00:02] thoughts like you what you remember
[02:00:05] about your life and what you think about
[02:00:07] right now just all comes out onto the
[02:00:09] pages hardest thing i've done my entire
[02:00:11] life
[02:00:12] i'm imagining i have [ __ ] i don't
[02:00:14] know how people buy this book
[02:00:16] then i walk up to people people walk up
[02:00:18] to me i'm like what are you thinking
[02:00:19] about [ __ ]
[02:00:21] hey thinking about me peeing in the bed

[02:00:47] man and they get at me they come oh
[02:00:49] there's a lot of those
[02:00:50] but that they're all doing that to
[02:00:52] themselves they don't even understand
[02:00:53] when you do that you're doing it to
[02:00:55] yourself right if you are attacking
[02:00:57] someone because you know that they have
[02:00:59] a weakness but you're pretending you
[02:01:00] don't have one you are attacking
[02:01:02] yourself you are chipping away your own
[02:01:05] personal sovereignty
[02:01:07] chipping away at your own respect so
[02:01:09] true man can't respect yourself you know
[02:01:11] you're a [ __ ] but that's what happened
[02:01:13] though joe to me i started looking at
[02:01:15] people realizing
[02:01:16] i know something about you
[02:01:21] because they don't want to talk about it

[02:02:00] your monkey ass
[02:02:01] i i got to tell me about you man because
[02:02:03] tomorrow
[02:02:04] i gotta go back to the grind
[02:02:07] and tomorrow i go back to the grind
[02:02:08] again and again and again and again i
[02:02:10] don't have time to put you into the hate
[02:02:12] bank there's no hate it's all filtered
[02:02:15] out man through the grind people don't
[02:02:16] get it there's there's great joy in the
[02:02:18] grind the great jordan to suffer it
[02:02:20] totally cleanses your body out man of
[02:02:22] any kind of hate makes you grow up
[02:02:25] it's also the being honest about it
[02:02:27] every step of the way the way you are in
[02:02:29] this book and the way you are the way
[02:02:30] you talk about things you're not not
[02:02:32] trying to paint yourself in a flattering
[02:02:34] way no it it forces you to continue to
[02:02:37] perform right by exposing all the [ __ ]
[02:02:40] that you used to do by exposing your
[02:02:42] procrastination your your slips your f
[02:02:44] your fallings you're falling back down
[02:02:47] and getting fat again all that stuff it
[02:02:49] forces you to be consistent like you
[02:02:53] know you did it today you know you did
[02:02:54] it today do you know you're going to be
[02:02:55] able to do it tomorrow well you have to
[02:02:57] you have to know that you have to know
[02:02:59] and that's my biggest fear man is that i
[02:03:01] know
[02:03:02] i can slip
[02:03:03] everybody goes man
[02:03:05] you're not permanent
[02:03:06] [ __ ]
[02:03:07] no one's permanent almost [ __ ]
[02:03:09] permanent that's why people that have
[02:03:10] accomplished great things and then want
[02:03:12] to talk about those great things to the
[02:03:14] end of time and not do anything anymore
[02:03:16] no they're [ __ ] themselves that's it
[02:03:18] those people that are looking for that
[02:03:19] golden age they're looking for that
[02:03:20] holding hands and walking off into the
[02:03:22] sunset the credits roll that doesn't
[02:03:24] exist
[02:03:25] it's not tattooed man it's not real i
[02:03:27] thought it was tattoos i was like [ __ ]
[02:03:28] i'm slipping
[02:03:29] i'm like what i put all this repetition
[02:03:32] i'm still slipping
[02:03:33] can't take a day off man
[02:03:35] can't take a day off man
[02:03:40] no days can't take a day off seven days
[02:03:42] a week
[02:03:43] i i get after but see the thing about i
[02:03:46] do active recovery right okay so what's
[02:03:48] what's a light active recovery day you
[02:03:50] say seven days seven miles is normal an
[02:03:53] easy six mile run that's active recovery
[02:03:56] at a low low heart rate i look like i'm
[02:03:59] walking
[02:04:00] i'm out to like a [ __ ] 9 30 10 minute
[02:04:02] mile heart rates real low i'm really big
[02:04:05] into the heart rate training man it's
[02:04:07] amazing
[02:04:08] so it makes you a machine
[02:04:10] it makes you a machine man how so it
[02:04:12] won't work it trains your heart
[02:04:14] in a way that
[02:04:16] the way i was able to run these 100-mile
[02:04:17] races like i was able to do it was off a
[02:04:19] heart rate
[02:04:20] so if you go at 80
[02:04:22] for me for the longest time it's like
[02:04:24] 100 like 147 heart rate 148 to 152 right
[02:04:28] around in there if i maintain that man
[02:04:31] i'm in that
[02:04:32] i'm burning that nice fat storage
[02:04:35] and that body wants to utilize that and
[02:04:38] it wants to burn that nice and slow and
[02:04:40] you're never getting that heart rate up
[02:04:41] or high you can get the heart rate for
[02:04:42] high it takes a lot to recover from that
[02:04:44] and the higher it goes the longer it
[02:04:46] takes for it to come down when i stayed
[02:04:48] at 145 146 147 heart rate for a long
[02:04:51] time when i get done running it will go
[02:04:54] back under 100 within two or three
[02:04:55] minutes
[02:04:56] and that's what you want you want that
[02:04:58] quick recovery
[02:04:59] so quick recovery means that your body's
[02:05:01] right on point and i look at my at my
[02:05:02] heart rate in the morning time it's
[02:05:04] using the 30s if it's like 45 46 47 i'm
[02:05:07] over trained easy day
[02:05:10] easy day means zone one zone one means
[02:05:12] i'm just going real light today
[02:05:14] so i train every day because why as a as
[02:05:17] my mind and as a human we're supposed to
[02:05:19] move
[02:05:21] every day i'm supposed to move and i'm
[02:05:22] not saying get after it every day get
[02:05:25] after me just do something every day
[02:05:26] right
[02:05:27] ride a bike like if you're real tired
[02:05:29] from working out hard ride an easy bike
[02:05:31] spin and as you're spinning
[02:05:33] take in your fluids
[02:05:35] rehydrate your body as you're acting
[02:05:36] because that's the best way to rehydrate
[02:05:38] your body
[02:05:40] and like taking a carbohydrate drink
[02:05:43] it gets all that good carbs you start to
[02:05:45] glycogen store your body again for the
[02:05:47] next day
[02:05:48] so as you're doing active stuff that
[02:05:50] blood's flowing nice active blood flow
[02:05:52] the nice active blood flow helps the
[02:05:54] recovery process
[02:05:56] along with drinking some some like
[02:05:59] endurance drink or some carbohydrate
[02:06:01] drink it gets all that glycogen through
[02:06:03] the system back to the muscles loads
[02:06:06] them back up again
[02:06:07] ready to fight another war tomorrow what
[02:06:09] do you use for a heart rate monitor i
[02:06:10] used to use polar for a long time
[02:06:13] um and i kind of still use polar now is
[02:06:16] it a wrist one or a chest it's a chest
[02:06:17] strap it's a nice cheap little chest
[02:06:20] strap and now i'm at a point now where i
[02:06:21] know
[02:06:22] i only do my heart rate in the morning
[02:06:24] time i don't even wear it when i run
[02:06:26] anymore do you check it with the strap
[02:06:28] in the morning or yeah your finger check
[02:06:30] the strap so you wake up you just put
[02:06:31] the strap on before you get out of bed
[02:06:33] put the strap on your body
[02:06:34] you don't first thing you do
[02:06:36] put a strap on or
[02:06:38] do your finger whatever one you can do
[02:06:40] you don't have a strap do your finger
[02:06:42] know what your average heart rate is you
[02:06:43] know your resting heart rate and then
[02:06:45] from there if it's a little bit high a
[02:06:46] little elevated you know you can't go
[02:06:48] off into that zone three zone four
[02:06:50] training day you gotta keep it at zone
[02:06:52] two or zone one
[02:06:54] so it's all about the heart rate the the
[02:06:56] resin heart rate so when you use it uh
[02:06:58] the chest trap does it register on an
[02:07:00] application on a phone like how do you
[02:07:02] read it on the watch on a watch is it a
[02:07:04] smart watch or is a polar watch it's a
[02:07:06] polar watch so it's a watch that shows
[02:07:08] you the heart rate that's reading off of
[02:07:09] the strap exactly that's all it does and
[02:07:12] so when you say zone ones this is these
[02:07:14] are the things that you've created zone
[02:07:15] ones onto the no these are like zones
[02:07:17] that um that's you know whoever created
[02:07:20] this like like the heart rate zone
[02:07:21] training
[02:07:22] so basically what i did in
[02:07:25] what's helped me out so much is
[02:07:27] my zone two training runs used to be 8
[02:07:30] 30.
[02:07:31] okay so that was my pace at like uh 140
[02:07:34] mile yep 830 mile
[02:07:37] through stretching
[02:07:38] and getting my body opened up
[02:07:41] my zone two run now is about a seven
[02:07:43] twenty one seven eighteen seven nineteen
[02:07:46] so you cut a minute off just by opening
[02:07:48] up your range of motion up my range of
[02:07:50] motion wow unbelie at the same exact
[02:07:53] heart rate so my stride if people look
[02:07:55] at videos of me like years ago when i
[02:07:56] was first doing my first bad water look
[02:07:58] i was scooting i had like it was so
[02:08:01] tight i looked i was this this very
[02:08:02] rigid runner
[02:08:04] now i actually run
[02:08:05] you know everything was so tight
[02:08:07] everything was like kind of like forming
[02:08:08] in i was like kind of like like my knees
[02:08:10] and my joints just going inward and now
[02:08:13] everything's right you know where it
[02:08:14] needs to be at and i have a nice long
[02:08:17] nice stride do you run on the street are
[02:08:19] you the most part for the most part i'm
[02:08:21] always traveling
[02:08:22] so the best thing you do you got your
[02:08:23] running shoes you get your [ __ ] you just
[02:08:25] go out and run but i i try to hit the
[02:08:27] trails you know some dirt as much as
[02:08:28] possible yeah so this is really good for
[02:08:30] your body but now my body is like
[02:08:32] [ __ ] it's like [ __ ] like iron
[02:08:35] i mean it it it can take some beating
[02:08:38] now when you when you run have you ever
[02:08:39] [ __ ] with those uh barefoot running
[02:08:41] shoes or minimalism no no
[02:08:43] hell no hell no you know what like look
[02:08:46] honestly i don't know many people who
[02:08:49] have been
[02:08:50] i just don't believe in it i don't
[02:08:52] believe in it i've i was born with shoes
[02:08:54] wearing shoes my whole [ __ ] life i'm
[02:08:56] not
[02:08:56] you know i'm black but i'm not from
[02:08:58] africa you know
[02:09:00] so
[02:09:01] i'm not down man i'm not down dear ever
[02:09:04] read the science behind it yeah the idea
[02:09:06] of like using all the muscles on your
[02:09:08] feet yeah i read the science behind it i
[02:09:10] also read sometimes [ __ ] have
[02:09:11] broken feet and [ __ ]
[02:09:14] i read that too but minimalist shoes on
[02:09:16] trails aren't bad yeah they're not i'm
[02:09:18] not doing it no no no i will break my oh
[02:09:21] my god man i'm running those things all
[02:09:23] the time really so so you like them yeah
[02:09:26] i it would kill me but i tell you what i
[02:09:28] ran in uh fat tires yesterday under
[02:09:31] armour fat tire which is like a cushiony
[02:09:33] ass shoe you like it and i was like it
[02:09:34] was so easy it's like it's like those
[02:09:36] hocus
[02:09:37] whatever no no uh under armour has these
[02:09:40] fat tires it's basically like uh a bmx
[02:09:43] tire track i think it's even made by a
[02:09:46] tire company makes the tread
[02:09:49] yeah man it's like it's got a mush to it
[02:09:51] and you you're running these things man
[02:09:53] you could run over see the thing about
[02:09:54] those five finger barefoot shoes right
[02:09:57] i like running those but you got to look
[02:09:58] where you're stepping you can't step on
[02:10:00] any hard rocks game yeah over you'll
[02:10:03] [ __ ] up your foot yeah quick because
[02:10:04] it's like it's going to go right in your
[02:10:06] foot it's a tiny little thin so i went
[02:10:08] from those to vivos vivo barefoot shoes
[02:10:11] that's what it looks like
[02:10:13] so when you run on those [ __ ] that is
[02:10:15] a cushiony glorious
[02:10:18] padding like when you when you hit the
[02:10:20] ground it's like smooshy smooshy smush i
[02:10:23] had the other ones jamie the ones with
[02:10:25] the boa it's because it just like got
[02:10:26] that little click one that you just
[02:10:28] pulled up yeah like those so it's like
[02:10:31] you twist it with that that's how you
[02:10:32] tighten it up with that little boa uh
[02:10:34] adjuster thing it's like a got a thread
[02:10:36] through it so you don't have to lace it
[02:10:37] or anything like that you just slip them
[02:10:39] on and pop that sucker down i like to
[02:10:41] feel the ground a little bit when i run
[02:10:43] yeah you're barely feeling [ __ ] with
[02:10:44] those yeah
[02:10:45] that's clown yeah but i like it it's
[02:10:47] gotta be good for your joints
[02:10:49] my joints didn't bother me at all
[02:10:50] yesterday which is crazy like after a
[02:10:52] good solid run because most of what i'm
[02:10:54] running is hills right like pretty steep
[02:10:56] and it's great my ass and leg's never
[02:10:58] been what do you weigh right now 200
[02:11:00] yeah you're thick dude man yeah so for
[02:11:03] me the pounding of the
[02:11:05] you know the the constant pounding with
[02:11:07] the feet to the ground it is uh it's
[02:11:10] it's rough on the ankles it's rough on
[02:11:12] you know the the joints but i don't feel
[02:11:14] it at all with those fat tires it was
[02:11:16] smooshy like i i got done running i felt
[02:11:18] like i cheated
[02:11:19] i did i felt like wow this is so much
[02:11:22] easier the cloud shoes yeah this just
[02:11:25] real cushioning and cam's always said
[02:11:27] that he runs with those a lot oh does he
[02:11:29] yeah he's run with a bunch of those like
[02:11:31] he's like because he runs so many
[02:11:32] [ __ ] miles he was running a marathon
[02:11:34] a day
[02:11:35] like pretty much every day i did that
[02:11:37] for a while bad bad bad i was
[02:11:40] sh
[02:11:41] my god i got wired in doing that [ __ ]
[02:11:44] man what is this right here
[02:11:46] so this is
[02:11:47] this is when i ran um i ran 150 mile
[02:11:51] trail race
[02:11:53] so the year before
[02:11:54] i did the same race it's 150 mile trail
[02:11:56] race i did it in i think around uh 40
[02:11:59] hours and i had to walk the last 60
[02:12:01] miles kind of i i had pneumonia here we
[02:12:04] go yeah
[02:12:06] and then i told the race director
[02:12:09] hey [ __ ] i'm coming back here
[02:12:10] next year and i'm breaking the course
[02:12:12] record i went back and then like 32
[02:12:14] hours
[02:12:16] wow same race
[02:12:18] wow
[02:12:21] now no when you 33 hours so when you're
[02:12:24] running what what shoes do you use
[02:12:26] right now i'm wearing brooks and i also
[02:12:28] wear um asics so it just depends on you
[02:12:31] know what kind of train i'm in where i'm
[02:12:33] at stuff like that for trails what do
[02:12:35] you what run for trails i actually for
[02:12:37] the longest time i wore a street running
[02:12:40] shoe
[02:12:40] really for trails yeah for the longest
[02:12:42] time how come because first of all my
[02:12:45] body was so messed up the only shoe i
[02:12:46] could ever wear was this brooks
[02:12:48] addiction and i hate even giving brooks
[02:12:50] credit right now because back in the day
[02:12:52] they wouldn't help a brother out i was
[02:12:54] running so many miles yeah so brooks i'm
[02:12:55] not trying to i'm not promoting brooks
[02:12:57] right now
[02:12:58] yeah merry christmas on that one
[02:13:00] i caught him up a million times hey man
[02:13:01] can i get like a discount or some [ __ ]
[02:13:04] hang up nobody nothing so but they do
[02:13:06] have a good shoe
[02:13:08] and i uh and i and it was not good pr
[02:13:11] horrible pr man you know what i'm saying
[02:13:13] like you know so
[02:13:14] but um yeah i love their shoe the only
[02:13:16] thing i could wear was that brook's
[02:13:17] addiction because my my bio mechanics
[02:13:19] was so messed up i tried so many
[02:13:21] different shoes and and that was a so i
[02:13:24] can now wear a neutral shoe so how i
[02:13:26] used to run and very few people know
[02:13:28] this i used to have heel wedges
[02:13:32] inserts heel wedges and
[02:13:35] get compression tape
[02:13:37] because my body was pushed so far in
[02:13:39] from being so tight in my hip flexors
[02:13:41] that so how i got such bad stress
[02:13:43] fractures
[02:13:44] was my bio mechanical there's a picture
[02:13:46] of my toe in there because my my toes
[02:13:49] just jammed in front of my shoes because
[02:13:50] my whole body just got this
[02:13:52] like bent in so you when you're saying
[02:13:55] bent in for people just listening you're
[02:13:57] if your hands are flat on a table you're
[02:13:59] turning the outside of your hands in up
[02:14:02] so that your thumbs are going down those
[02:14:04] are my so yeah so that's those big toes
[02:14:06] right going down or going down and into
[02:14:09] the shoe and the outside of your foot
[02:14:10] was up was above it right so what i had
[02:14:13] to do to run because i was like god i
[02:14:14] got stress fractures all the time
[02:14:16] and my feet were so [ __ ] up sometimes
[02:14:18] you see that with people's shoes like
[02:14:20] how they're worn out worn out worn out
[02:14:22] on the sideways example like a wedge
[02:14:24] right can you look at it from behind
[02:14:26] this crazy yeah that was my shoe so i
[02:14:28] had to get a heel wedge
[02:14:30] to keep my heel from going down got
[02:14:32] severe tendonitis in the back of my
[02:14:34] ankle
[02:14:35] actually you had to make it thicker on
[02:14:37] one side that's right just to force on
[02:14:38] the inside flat right so the inside i
[02:14:41] had to push up and i had to get
[02:14:42] compression tape so it was compression
[02:14:44] tape heel wedges
[02:14:46] and an insert
[02:14:47] and that's how i ran every [ __ ] day
[02:14:50] did you go to a running coach or
[02:14:51] anything did you i don't know
[02:14:56] but didn't you want to know what you
[02:14:58] were doing wrong you know what man that
[02:15:00] was part of that garanimal mindset man
[02:15:02] [ __ ] it man i'm supposed to be broken
[02:15:03] you know
[02:15:04] but then
[02:15:05] i got smarter as time went and said oh
[02:15:07] man this is some painful [ __ ] running
[02:15:10] 100 mile races with this kind of
[02:15:12] tendinitis and my feet being [ __ ] up
[02:15:13] it was so painful
[02:15:15] so i was like you know what so then
[02:15:16] after i started stretching
[02:15:18] i was like my god all this was from
[02:15:20] having a tight i got so massive my god i
[02:15:22] was i was in all these different
[02:15:23] contraptions
[02:15:25] and now i just wear normal running shoes
[02:15:27] wow yeah so i went from
[02:15:29] being contraptioned up man
[02:15:31] like literally contraption up so it's
[02:15:34] all just the stretching that opened up
[02:15:35] the range of motion
[02:15:38] now when people talk about range of
[02:15:39] motion they don't understand how tight i
[02:15:42] was like no one understands like when
[02:15:44] you repeatedly
[02:15:46] do what i was doing to myself
[02:15:49] and you were born with the stress i was
[02:15:51] born under
[02:15:52] like i hate i can't paint a clear it's
[02:15:55] it's pretty clear in the book
[02:15:57] man
[02:15:58] my life was bad the stress i endured on
[02:16:00] a daily i had two people
[02:16:03] and my body was proof of literally
[02:16:06] what my life was doing to me it
[02:16:07] literally was
[02:16:08] knotted all my muscles up because i was
[02:16:11] always under this fight or flight you
[02:16:13] know my my dad had made me so [ __ ]
[02:16:15] scared of [ __ ]
[02:16:17] you know to to unwind this [ __ ]
[02:16:19] man was like
[02:16:21] it was it was it was a hard task you
[02:16:23] know i it was a hard it was a hard task
[02:16:25] man so it's a lot of times it's not just
[02:16:28] all the hard training no but it's also
[02:16:30] the mind the mind because think about it
[02:16:32] man when you're under stress
[02:16:34] that hip flexor that that psoas muscle
[02:16:36] which is attached to your t12
[02:16:39] that that's the only muscle that
[02:16:40] attaches your lower body to your upper
[02:16:42] body
[02:16:43] and that's the muscle that's that's your
[02:16:44] fight or flight whenever you get nervous
[02:16:46] or scared or something like that that
[02:16:47] [ __ ] was tightened up i mean i
[02:16:49] mean your whole body is
[02:16:51] i lived in that like almost fetal
[02:16:52] position in my mind
[02:16:54] for so many years
[02:16:56] so i was always on this like tight-knit
[02:16:58] tension [ __ ] guy

## Plain Text (for processing)

oh come on let's go boom and we're live david goggins your book is [ __ ] fantastic man this has been my running partner the audio version of it has been my running partner for the last week it's [ __ ] amazing man well i appreciate that thank you well you guys are doing something very unusual the book is great i've read i've read it like sat down red red but the the audio book is really interesting right because you and the gentleman you wrote it with yeah adam adam schonick adam schonick who who reads it then you come on and talk about things in between so it's more than just the book right it's the book plus it's the book plus like a podcast right yeah so how that came to be man is um as i was going through this book for the last year we would go through change stuff up have so many stories man we went through interviews from people so many stories he would come back and read it to me all my changes and when he read i'm like man this guy has a great reading voice i love his reading voice and i started getting these different ideas about doing it like you know what maybe he can read and i can do my podcast thing on the side and he can like after each chapter in between chapters make it real interactive type of thing and that's kind of how it came to be man at the beginning i gotta be honest the beginning i was like who is this [ __ ] talking for david gardens i was gonna call dave like dick you redo this why don't you do it why are you but but it works right it really does work yeah like as as it goes on and i got also it's very obvious that you and him are good friends so when you guys are talking then i don't mind him reading for you as much for some strange reason right i know it doesn't make any sense well i want to say we're good friends i'm i'm just joking adam that you can hear me right now um he became a pain in my [ __ ] ass during this process man because you know he's just uh he's a real anal guy you know he he helped out a lot you know i'm a i'm a real raw sadistic type of mindset and he uh he helped me put that on paper man so i gave him a lot of credit for that well it it comes across the book is outstanding and you know it's it's it's more than just sitting like sitting across you and you telling your story is one thing but this long detailed history of how you became to be the person you became i think it's very educational for people because they can realize like oh he wasn't always this guy right this is what's [ __ ] up about people like you see a guy who's like you who runs i mean how many ultra marathons did you run in a row you read some insane in a row just stop and think about that ladies and gentlemen eight hundreds means eight 100 mile races eight weekends in a row a 100 mile race will put you out for [ __ ] six months right you know when you ran eight of them eight weekends what's the [ __ ] it's a [ __ ] insane accomplishment it was nuts you think about a person like that you think of them as in this like static fully formed version right you don't usually get to see and especially someone like you who you went into so much depth about your rise and fall and rise and fall it wasn't like a straight linear process between you getting inspired and you becoming this bad [ __ ] no it wasn't like um what's that show called um that will smith plays that that black guy who kind of makes it in um in the financial world a pursuit of happiness i never saw that yeah it's a great movie it wasn't like pursuit of happiness man like like with a guy who struggles and he and he gets over it and he makes it yeah i feel on my ass i i thought i got the top mount everest and my neighbors just [ __ ] slide right underneath me man i was like god dawg i start from scratch again scratch became my friend literally man so you know that's that's how you put in the book man just going up going down going up just a real raw version of how my life was and it was so in-depth to go back through your life with the fine-tooth comb that i almost got embarrassed even put it out there to people yeah that's what i understand man like even me right now to talk to you i'm in the car for a [ __ ] hour getting pumped up cause i'm i'm a shy introverted leave me alone type of guy like i'm still that [ __ ] who is six years old you know at a play who can't say his line because i know i'm gonna stutter in front of five people so i walk off the stage that's still me so every day i'm fighting that dude so people think oh my god man you're in a podcast look so crazy so evil no i'm trying to be locked into joe so my mind isn't very off saying let's run out the damn door because people are watching me on the [ __ ] podcast i want to open this damn door and get the hell out of here man so that's the real me so i'm not sadistic man i'm focused on what i have to do to stay locked into the game of life and that's what and that's why i tell people man i i go there i go there that's one of the reasons why this book is so good is because you're so honest about your vulnerabilities and how you overcome them and for people that see someone who's a beast who's done great things you just assume that they're different than you right but then you hear about your insecurities and your pitfalls and all the things that went wrong with you and you realized well god damn it those are the same things that go wrong with me like maybe i have that inside of me and i've just never summoned it right and i'll tell you this i started really realizing that when i started overcoming myself i started getting around these real alpha males these hard hard men and i always put people way above me when i was growing up like my god they had to have a lot more than me to get to where they're at and a lot of them did but once you get around the the best of the best of the best people you can kind of start breaking them down and realizing man you you're just as [ __ ] up as me like we all have but all you did was you hit it better your your your upbringing your mom and dad your society the way you were raised it hit it better than than mine you weren't the only black kid or there was like five in in a school you know i can't hide going through buzz i was only black you can't hide but i started realizing just because i look different than you a lot of you my first cannot either so it started giving me courage to watch some people that were all have a story we all have a jacked up life in one way or another some of us don't have the guts to talk about it though and that's where i found the guts to talk about mine well there's some there's purity in physical pursuits right because it doesn't matter what your social status is it doesn't matter how people perceive you when it when it comes down to how long can you stay in that pool when it comes down to how far can you run when it comes down to how much can you push yourself past the part where you want to quit how far can you keep going there's a purity in that that it did dissolve social order all that [ __ ] all the what people think about you goes out the window it's what who who are you right now that's right who are you right now that's a true statement man and i look at it as a psychological warfare and that's where i started learning that that life is one big psychological warfare that you play on yourself you play on yourself man the most important conversation i ever had with is with myself and the [ __ ] i was telling myself was so [ __ ] up it was so wrong it was so misguided and other people start to write that dialogue for you also it starts to be what you say to yourself every single day and i started creating a whole nother warfare a whole nother battle started becoming i was like oh hang on a second coggins you have these tools do you have these tools your life was basically the perfect the perfect grounds for training for where you need to go in your life all the beatings all the all the bullying all that you know you going through uh learning disabilities all the struggles it was the absolute perfect training ground for you to go to where you need to go and that's how i start looking at my life versus what was me poopy pants kick a rock down the street mentality it was no god just hooked you right the [ __ ] up he hooked you right up man with the perfect place you were training for the first 18 19 20 you were training for this stuff man you have the advantage of everybody else versus my god they're so above me they came from a great family mom and dad loved them they didn't have to learn they didn't start they didn't struggle no man your struggle is what made you who you are now so i started flipping this into a whole different i started being a master of what i was scared of i was scared of my mind and i became a literally a master of that mind and that's what now from now on it sets me apart from most people i start diving into that well that is a big part of the story is when you go over your childhood and you know your abusive father and then having this great guy that was going to become your stepdad and then he gets murdered it's like right when you're about to get out of it everything looks good boom then he gets murdered it's like these things really did sort of set you up to start from scratch again and just go okay roger that we start from scratch and now you have that attitude you developed it through all of these horrible personal experiences all the trials and tribulations all the evil [ __ ] that people try to do to you that sort of set you up to be able to deal in a way that a lot of people can't well i used to look at my life from a different vantage point and when you're when you're in all the muck and you're just walking in muck and walking in muck and walking the muck you don't see that if you look off to the [ __ ] left of the muck there's a sidewalk brother get off get off of it you have your head down looking in this muck once i saw the sidewalk got the sidewalk i got a little break and i got a different vantage point and then from the sidewalk i found a cliff then i found a mountain i got way up high on top of my life and looked back down on it and said okay i gotta figure this out man i'm not going anywhere i'm starting to lie i'm starting like so when you have a messed up foundation i started lying about everything i wanted people to like me i wanted to be accepted in some society of life some social society and i i said man this isn't the right way i messed up here i messed up here i messed up everywhere and so i realized the worst thing that happened to me is i lost myself i never had myself i never found myself had no self-esteem so i knew through working out and through learning because it took a lot for me to learn also i started finding self-esteem once i found that that's when doors started opening up i started i stopped caring about people that what they thought being judged wow if i say this if i started right now are you gonna make fun of me i stopped caring about that and that's my life started really changing for me slowly but surely that that's such an important point when you're talking about the working out because a lot of people when they think about working out they think of it as being a physical thing right no no i did it for mental yeah people always say my god like no don't don't look at it like i didn't care about losing weight i don't care about being the fastest person i think about i wasn't making the olympics i wasn't going to pros i could barely read and write when i was in a junior in high school i wasn't going anywhere i saw working out as a way for me to build calluses on my mind i had to callous over the victim's mentality so i watched these movies i you know i talked about rocket last time i was on here i always equated training to mental toughening like it always looked brutal people waking up early and doing all these things and look it looks horrible it's like wow i gotta start doing that not to get better bigger and stronger but that is what's gonna build me that looks uncomfortable that looks brutal and getting up early i don't want to do that so i made this long list of things i don't want to do and through that i found myself i started like i'm like you guys aren't doing this [ __ ] in high school you guys aren't getting up at five o'clock in the morning running over here in this golf course so i started seeing myself very differently than the average human being i was like hold on a second i have something they don't have and that's when i started to develop these things through working out it was this great never-ending work ethic and through work ethic i develop self-esteem now is this something that you learned is this something you learned yourself from from exercise yourself or is it something you had read or heard about like what made you equate this doing this and doing these difficult things physically to mental toughness to being this is the discipline that you need in order to get your life out of the situation you're in so i never read anything you know i i could barely read you know so i wasn't reading back then i just saw i watched a lot of movies and i was really big into visualization and um i always equated working out to struggle and i struggled my whole life but i ran from it so i started realizing man i got to start facing the struggle and i got to be mentally strong for the struggle so that's why i started coming up with like i i'm training for life mentally i'm training for life i'm not training for like to live 400 pounds and i found out on my own pretty much is that through this through through discipline through self-discipline through repetition do tons of repetition the same thing that you don't want to do and that's that's the key thing through repetition of things you don't want to do you develop mental like like an armor for your mind start to armor your mind cause your mind's like okay we suffer we suffer every day it's what we do we do stuff that sucks every day so then when the suck stuff comes you're ready for it and that's how i started coming up you know i just started being very uncomfortable and now it's like just a way of life it's a crazy thing to figure out though it's like that you figured it out and you didn't just figure it out you embraced it like when you were talking about your senior year of high school when you're talking about your your mirror being your accountability mirror like you had a radical shift like you just decided to not be a [ __ ] loser and to start tightening up and start holding yourself accountable and and get ready for things so i had this my whole life i mean i don't know if people believe in god or what i don't care what you believe in there's been this unrelenting voice in my head we all have this voice it's the right or wrong voice and a lot of times that voice guides us into comfort and my voice guided me to comfort a lot but i have this other voice i heard my whole life saying hey [ __ ] what are you doing nah man we gotta go over here we have to go over here to to that rock pile over in the [ __ ] corner where nobody's at that's that's where victory's at were over in that corner so this voice was giving me all these answers not i wasn't real smart kid growing up but i had this crazy voice in my head saying over there is where the [ __ ] answers are and i won't listen to it because over there was pain over there was me looking in the mirror over there was me being accountable for all these things that went through my life even though people put them on me it's not mine to own and i didn't want to go over there by myself but i had to and this voice was guiding me there out it's god whatever you want to call it uh but that's what that's what it was in me do you think that's just what you when you separate yourself from your ego and what you were your insecurities and all you like if you were giving yourself advice you would say that's what the thing is to do so do you think that's what it was like your subconscious or though you stripped away from all the [ __ ] when you couldn't lie to yourself because it's a voice in your head that's exactly it it's exactly it because it knew it knew i was a character i was trying to find myself through a character i was making different hairstyles and sagging my pants and i was off i was off man i was i was a clown i was a clown and and i was like this is not this is not where you're supposed to be in life man it's ugly when you look in that dirty mirror and you're trying to do a new hairstyle to go to school you know i had a hairstyle one time where i shaved the top of my head you know how old men had the hair like leaving their head yeah yeah so i went to school with hair on the side of my head and in my back and i shaved the the whole top of my head i just i went to school like that you know and then i had like what did the kids say i wanted to i don't remember what they said but i was just a funny dude you know so that was my thing i was the funny dude that came into school like criss cross came out when i was in high school so my pants were backwards i seen what i passed backwards sagged down past my ass crack shirt turned backwards with a toothbrush in my mouth with the reverse part the reverse part is your head is shaved and you have some hair on top just a little piece of hair versus like a like a part right through hair the part was on a bald head so it was just i i i would sit at home instead of studying i would think about what can i do to impress a [ __ ] at school and that became my life and that is it's a long road to hoe to get to the guy who says now you'll never smile on any podcast looks so serious i look at that [ __ ] i'm like you [ __ ] have no idea who i am who where i've come from to get here today you could have probably been an entertainer like you probably because you were doing all that kind of [ __ ] i have some jokes joe i got some jokes yeah you do so what people read in this book can't hurt me it's a sad story it's a horrible story it's a tragic story it's a story that made me who in the day but you have to learn to laugh at yourself too once you once you go through that [ __ ] yeah now so there's a lot of parts in there there's a lot of me against a lot of white people you know and i have a routine that i won't do so people who hire me to speak i'm not going to do the routine i often do it sometimes think about it i was a 36 black guy to go through still training okay no matter how many people out of probably looking at um probably 11 12 to make it through probably 13 000 seals i was probably the 36 i was a 36 black guy to make it through and over since like the like 1940s you know you're looking at almost 70 years wow yeah so you know you know you know do the math on that so there's not a lot of black guys and so i take that and i make a nice comedy skit out of that [ __ ] you know like like like the first time they tied me up and threw me it's called drown proofing yeah so i'm negative boring as hell you know me too oh i'm related to that big time yeah she wanted a few white boys man they're that negative boy you sit like a rock and that's hard so imagine them getting your hands and feet tying your ass up and throwing in the [ __ ] water and say swim ah it was like throwing a cat in the water with [ __ ] brick on them so i was just losing my [ __ ] mind so it's so many things i had to get over you know and i found humor i found humor in my suffering i was like [ __ ] what are you doing out here goggins like this is crazy like you're you're literally trying to reinvent the wheel but i was trying to reinvent my mind i was trying to reinvent my mind and i used every single tactic possible to do that i didn't want to live you know live in this world where i was a fake human being anymore and i was tired of blaming everybody for where i was at my dad beat me this happened i mean my dad ran prostitutes man my dad literally snatched the soul out of my mom like my mom is still battling like after my mom left my dad and that's why i'm talking about in the book she got married three times for a total of six months you know i don't go there and i'm not gonna talk about the guys she married so this woman was she's beautiful she's she's so smart all this stuff man this guy literally stripped her soul away and i was a young kid watching it and i had no soul to begin with and my my brother he has a story that he could write eight books you know my dad just came through and just washed us all clean so to to to come around he died about four years ago four or five years ago not for sure i didn't go to the funeral but i forgave him so i saw my dad through an eight-year-old's eye so so we left when i was eight and then at 22 i went back to see him through a grown man's eyes and he was the same person i remembered but i had to you can't live with hate you cannot move forward as much as that guy tried to ruin all of our lives that's where i came from i had to figure out the origin of where i started from so when i was going back through my life trying to fix who i am the [ __ ] up person i was like if your knee hurts it's usually not your [ __ ] knee that's hurting it's something else man like it could be a tight quad it could be the right leg if it's the left leg you got to find out the origin of where all this [ __ ] began and i it was him so i had to go back to where you know my roots and the origin of all this happen and it's hard to do that did you make peace with him i made big piece with so we didn't have a peaceful conversation we you know we we we left very animal he's a he's a he's a vicious man he he was a vicious man i mean medieval [ __ ] so i had become a medieval [ __ ] at that time i was 22 and i was the big boy and so i was no longer the guy who was afraid it was not like hey i want to kill you type of [ __ ] and we were sitting at denny's after an all-night skate or whatever the hell you know he owned bars and skating rings like that and so we were sitting down and we kind of got into it and i just kind of left and but i had to make peace with it in myself i i could not hold on to that hate cause hold on to that hate was half the reason why i kept falling into the same pattern of failing i had to get i had to start dumping off some baggage i had to start figuring out me through him and that's all he was there for he was the origin i had to figure him out figure out why he was so evil to my mom to me my brother and i had to start studying him like a lot of people have situations where someone does something and we all attack that person like like on the media if someone does something wrong everybody now is [ __ ] perfect and we now judge this guy i don't judge him i don't judge anybody what i do is i start studying them why did they do that not in a judging way i want to learn from you and what'd you get out of your dad i got that he was he grew up rough he had he was very insecure had a lot of kids and his insecurities just trickled over onto us so yeah he jacked us up real good but he never fixed himself so if you never fix yourself the next person in line is going to get the wrath and we were next in line you know his his first wife you know killed herself or whatever happened and you know got burned up in the house or something some craziness and there's a lot of stuff that goes on there that i didn't put in the book because i don't feel like going to court yeah but um yeah that's uh it was it was a lot of stuff you know one of the great parts about this book is that you you detail exactly what was going through your mind in terms of like your weaknesses and how you had failed and and then you it's not just one time like you you do the thing in high school where you get your [ __ ] together and then you join the military and then you wind up getting fat again and then when you go when you have to lose what is 106 pounds in three months yep to to to qualify for seal training yep that's insane yeah because when i realized at that time once again i failed again i thought so what you're talking about is i took this asvab test you know i didn't know how to read and write pretty much in high school i was like a fourth grade reading level and i took that test a few times and i finally passed it and when i passed it i actually drove my car to the to the daggone airport and watched planes take off because i was like i'm gonna be on one of those planes one day going to air force boot camp so i i never i always fix the things on the surface so if i couldn't read and write learn to read and write i i would always fix these things on the surface level and so whenever something hard would would like like raise ugly head i didn't have any kind of tools to handle it like man i thought i fixed this already man but no i didn't go deep into the dungeon of my soul to say okay what is making you a quitter what is making you a weak man what is making you afraid and so that's why i kept on quitting and going back to start or not knowing how to get through hard times and that's why i was telling people i'm not a theorist i didn't study like you know i didn't study a [ __ ] book i literally put myself in a fire repeatedly like a sword you put a sword in the fire repeatedly and repeat if you keep on doing that you're going to get a nice sword and you keep on beating it you got to beat the [ __ ] out of it and that's what i am yeah i i became that i i said okay we can't quit we got to figure out why you are this [ __ ] why are you this [ __ ] man what is wrong with you what's going on here so i kept on putting the sword back in the dagger on fire and i just beat it harder and i beat it harder before i knew i started realizing all right man the brain is starting to get hard the brain is starting to get hard i'm no longer a theorist i'm now a practitioner i put it in hell i dissected it while it's in hell because you can't dissect anything in a normal environment you can't dissect anything in 72 degree weather you must put it in the [ __ ] freezer and freeze the [ __ ] out of it and then you dissect it dissect it when it's miserable dissect the brain when all this thinking about is i need to get out of here man i want to get out of the [ __ ] freezer open the door and he said nah five more seconds man five more seconds in the freezer and that's when you start to pick that brain apart and that's what all this stuff did to me i kept on putting myself back into the freezer or the fire and beating the [ __ ] out of myself mentally and physically before i knew it this is what happened wow it's an interesting way to self-teach yes like most people that you know you talk to that are disciplined they you know they have something that they read that inspired them they have certain people that they look up to there's certain you know coaches that taught them there's certain important moments in their life but for you it's a system of failure and and reflection and then rebooting that's it repeated failure and people think a lot of times it taught me that i'm angry oh my god you sound so angry you cut so much oh my god why you cuss so much why are you so crazy if you read my book i cannot explain my life by saying hey it was a merry [ __ ] christmas man no it wasn't i want you i want you to go there with me i'm taking you there with me i'm a storyteller i want to take your ass down paradise where i so the house i lived in buffalo new york that i got my ass beat every day funny we lived on paradise road and it was anything but [ __ ] paradise so i want you to go there with me you want to learn from me let me take your ass home let me take you there so that's the whole thing about it man we're scared to dive into our lives what made us who we are the beautiful people that we are we're all jacked up in so many ways that's the beauty of us that's the beauty of me i'm jacked up but i figured out my own little process on how to get unjacked up and how to i'm not gonna get the same you know i'm not gonna get the same way you're gonna get there you may get there by going pointing to point b i might go point c to d to e to f i want to be there the same way you are just a little harder that's how i train my brain so it's just different i'm a different thinker when you stop and think about all the different times that you did have to reboot and how you you you found like new goals and you found new inspiration you fired up a new discipline and you became stronger and harder and you got one of the things that people always look for in life they look for a point where they can rest yes oh i'm going to retire you know like people love they love that expression the golden years they love that expression yeah they love the they love the idea of struggle as long as it ends and then when it ends they're going to have a nice comfortable spot it must end the suffering must end yeah you should relax man you've done so much that's right you've really done so much but this the idea of reaching this golden year is is it's a very flawed idea because it's an idea that you're gonna you're gonna work hard but then you're gonna reach the finish line but there's no finish line no it doesn't exist that's the scary thing about life my friend that is a scary thing right and that's what fatigues me people go man why don't you ever smile there's no [ __ ] end my friend there's no end there's no end i know that you're you're you're going to meet cam haynes after this yes sir and listen please if you guys run put a number of that miles that you're going to run and leave it at that do not say let's see who quits because you will both die because that's a hard man he is a hard man cameron haynes is a hard man he will run until you die or he dies he's a hard man dude he doesn't he does those 240s he does ultra he's a sick [ __ ] and see those are the guys i'm looking for yeah that's a scary do you want the two of you guys you need to pick a number i know whatever you get i think you guys are going to run 35 miles yeah you're gonna do good yeah 35 is a good number yeah we've been texting back and forth trying to make it you know trying to make it sensible you know yeah so we don't go off the chain because if one of you [ __ ] wakes up and has a good strong espresso i know [ __ ] it let's do 300. it's gonna be on it's gonna be a long day man no that's it yeah you you know this new race that they're doing where they're um you run for one hour you run like as many and then you have like a bell rings and then you sit down for a little bit you know what i mean like you there's like a 4.17 mile thing yep it's that sick [ __ ] what was it the guy's name that created that like i did the barclay marathon yes you're talking about last yeah yeah this is crazy [ __ ] so he had people running for days and days and days he invited me out there for this race yeah i actually got into the barclay last year but couldn't do it because of the book so i'm supposed to do it this year but now you know we'll see again how the schedule goes but yeah that that's a sick sick man i've done a couple of his races and like he has one called strolling jim i actually won that one in 2016. but he's a he's a sick man what is this scrolling this is probably easiest race it's like it's like through the back country of uh tennessee it's a 41 mile race on the road it's one of the first you know ultra marathons out there ever and my mom lives in nashville so it's like an hour drive i went up there and it was like when my first race is back after me being all sick and jacked up for so long and i got lucky had a good race and i happened to want it you know you were talking about psoas muscle yeah we have this thing now that we got what does that call the pro pro so right so right have you ever used one i have it also i i saw it in there that that little black contraption yeah that hard plastic thing yeah phenomenal it's evil man yeah yeah it's good it's amazing i started getting tightness in that when i was running a lot like i'd never gotten tightness in that area before yeah it seems like that's a running thing right it's a running thing and also a very stressed thing you know if you're real stressed out man like for me like i talked about the origin where like where things start my body was so wrapped tight i didn't know where like where to start yeah so i started with the psoas muscle so that's a real good spot well the problem with these races is pro the problem with people like you that's the problem with these races like if you get you and another you right and they're in there together like you [ __ ] are gonna kill each other it's a long day it's a long day it's a long day it's a long day because if they're doing a last man standing type deal right yeah like the first person to quit yeah it's a it's a real long day man i mean i've been up i got a couple hills under my belt man i know how to fail for 130 hours to move yeah and i know how to self-motivate a lot of [ __ ] don't know how to self-motivate man like we like to put the headphones on like before the big game and listen to the music yeah what the [ __ ] did you do when the headphones come off bro it's you in your own mind right i know how to do that that's that's the hard part do you ever listen to music when you run never never i told you jamie's cheating he has that video i got i thought you might have seen it but he talks about like running with music no what did you say i find it find the video we'll play it we might not be able to play it we get is it somebody else's content i actually um but i did during my last pull-up record i listened to you know that song um from rocky 1 round 14 when rocky gets knocked down the corner i listened to this two minutes and 13 seconds long i listened on repeat for 17 hours christmas [ __ ] merry christmas man 17 hours man i went to such a dark dark evil i have a picture in my hand in the book i was in a dark i went to this i went to a place man that i'm like i can do anything here we gotta live here for a while because i kept on feeling that wreck i go like i don't want to see a pull-up bar again i mean like i did 67 000 pulls man like this is my throat i can't i don't want to see no pull up so it's like i'm i'm doing this come hello high water man i broke it out it's just let me hear this let me hear let's play this so i never trained with music there's a reason why i don't do that the music's not going to always be there the tv the distractions all these external things i'm in the gym right now with all this live music people needed to get fired up they needed to stay motivated they need to stay in the fight they needed to just go in the gym to do whatever they're gonna do what do you do when you have no external motivation it's about the internal what do you say to yourself how are you going to fire yourself up what's that flame inside of you that keeps you going let that keep you going not this and when you're doing this the whole time you're doing this you're doing some of the hardest chin-ups you can do you got a chain around your neck right folks that are just listening and you're pulling down on ropes you're doing chin-ups on it looks like taped up ropes yes sir that's what it is yeah those are grip that's like jiu jitsu guys do a lot of those yes i was uh i spoke to the university of alabama and they were in there you know most you know most these athletes man they got to get hyped so that music is blaring yeah i'm like man once that [ __ ] comes off and you get popped in your [ __ ] mouth your headphones are on the sidelines brother what's gonna happen yeah you can say to yourself then so that's that's how i train my mind man i i trade my mind i don't get popped in my mouth man i'm gonna get popped in the back of an alley one day man running around doing what i do and there's gonna be no music yeah you better fight you're gonna figure it out i told you jamie's cheating when i first started running people said do you run with music and i know running it's cheating when you have music on it's cheating you're cheating you listen to music but now i listen to music all the time but more than i listen to music i listen to books yeah books on tape uh audiobooks and yours is like i said has been the last two weeks has been my running partner well i appreciate that man you're supposed to be phenomenal man it's phenomenal and you're doing this kind of independently right yeah so what i did man is i pissed off a lot of people i was um i so in 2012 i got an offer for my book for 30 thousand dollars i said you can go [ __ ] yourself you know what hell i went through brother so then everybody was like you know we don't see a market for a black guy ultra runner fat guy who uh couldn't read like uh you know 15 percent of america's black you know i won't see any [ __ ] you know people buying your book they think only black people will buy your book there's some ignorant people out there man everybody that follows me is white i don't have a black i have like three black followers man event was just left he's furious he's a big fan he's black yeah he's like he's like an unusual species out there man like and so i'm sitting there walking around going man you don't even know who like everybody talk to is white like you know it's the ignorance of the world and i'm in these meetings here and this kind of stuff so now 2018 i get a 300 000 offer for a first-time author so i'm sitting back you know i'm like my god man you know i used to make like [ __ ] sixty thousand dollars a year you know this is the biggest payday yet and i started thinking i took that one second i talked about the one second decision a lot about what i went through my life what i've done and i was like you know what i struggled so hard in my life i went through so much that the biggest trophy i own now is that book the biggest trophy i don't know is not the book itself it's what's in the book it's what like i don't give a [ __ ] if that sells one copy honest to god man like like my what i did and that's what i hope people understand your life in the journey you put yourself through there's no there's nothing more than that and that's all i want people to do is realize that you have to struggle you have to struggle the bigger the struggle the bigger the peace the bigger the suffering the more peace i'm not just saying this because you're here but this book is valuable this book is very valuable it's valuable to people like anybody that you know i mean biographies are very always valuable when you get to see the mindset of a person who's done things that you haven't done you get to understand like that they're overcoming sort of the same sort of situations in their mind that you are same insecurities and pitfalls but yeah everybody's going through it man yeah everybody that's that's something i say i'm blessed that way that my story there's no color involved in it it's a human story about struggle and i happen to be in so many different situations that so many people can relate to about struggle that i guarantee you mark my word you read that book there will be a section of that book that resonates with you hardcore it will make you think if if you're not ready to think about your life and think about you know where you can be and think about what you haven't done the book's not for you if you're not ready to sell to really self-reflect and hold yourself accountable for where you're at and where you're not the book is not for you is real i've read a lot of self-help books and i've listened to a lot of self-help books on tape too and a lot of just some of them that i have to shut off i have to shut off a quarter way and i feel like someone's lying to me i just like you're bullshitting me you're just saying things this i'm not this doesn't resonate with me it doesn't it's not working right like i'll give it a chance i'll give it a chance but if i'm you know a half hour in two hours in it's still the same nonsense i don't feel anything right i'm getting itchy listening to you you know i just want to pull the headphones off and i'll just kill it and i'll stop it this is the total opposite this one man i was i was go i was running extra miles so i could stay with the headphones on and the the thing that i think is going to happen with this book is people are going to get it they're going to get a hold of whether it's the audiobook or their book book and they're going to they're going to recommend it and then it's going to spread like wildfire this is a powerful book this is a real self-help book this is like this is a real one like it's not like uh someone orchestrates this whole thing like what i'm going to do is i'm going to become a motivator i'm going to be i'm going to be a personal influencer i'm going to be that guy that goes out there and tells people you can optimize your life here's how you do it and there's so many of those [ __ ] guys out there right yeah that's not me man i know this one dude i ran into him recently i ran into him at this restaurant he's fat as [ __ ] he's got this big old belly and i know he does these these motivational things and i'm looking at him i'm like what are you talking about man like you're weak right look at your body look at your own temple look at your meat vehicle you're carrying around this [ __ ] donut around your waist it's just he was eating shitty food and he looked soft and like wake up [ __ ] so many people are doing that now man how many people are talking this noise exactly and i see them yeah i know them i'm not gonna say names but i know them i'm like man dude you know why my life is miserable right now because i can't go on your show right now your podcast if i didn't get after it this morning so i cannot talk to people unless you're authentic unless i'm authentic because i used to be the most unauthentic [ __ ] on the planet now i have this voicemail saying oh no i'll call you up if i lie to you about something even a white lie hey yo joe guess what dude i [ __ ] lied to you man like that wasn't real like it would bother me that badly now you know so another thing i didn't what's funny about this book stuff man i didn't set out to write a book like literally man when i was 24 years old and a cow's fat spraying for cockroaches eating donuts and drinking milkshakes i did not plan on doing this all i wanted to do was change the [ __ ] reflection in that dagger mirror this is all just a box it's it's it's a byproduct of of that and that's that's the funny thing about it like everybody's like oh my god david goggles what you know what tell you i'm like what the [ __ ] that's why it works though unbelievable it works because you really did do it you really did do all those things and you show how you did it and you're not using any [ __ ] theatrical jargon no you're not you know you're you know you're not saying a bunch of buzzwords can you live the life of an actualized person i can show you how and you look at this guy talking he's got a neck like a pencil and his his body is just frail like you don't even understand adversity you don't understand overcoming this is not the secret you know this isn't about the law of [ __ ] attraction yeah there ain't no attraction here brother this ain't no attraction here man this book is straight up yeah they love nonsense yeah this is no nonsense man no nonsense this is a real self-help book man this is the real deal that's how you self-help you're self-help by people who've done it and you learn what they did and you realize there's no shortcuts right and then you learn to embrace that no shortcut mentality and enjoy enjoy the suffering and the grind of it and what we talked about earlier there's no [ __ ] finish line doesn't exist you know what's funny about that is i have people now so when i was in the worst part of my life those people want to bring you back in those people's like like you can see who you hang out with like when you're in your worst and when you're trying to get better with what makes it hard to get better is that you are hanging around people who like let's say you're an alcoholic you hang around people who drink and i say you want to stop drinking those people want to bring you back in like i used to be this guy this guy who was you know who wasn't worth anything now those people who are still there they're 16 17 18 30 years ago they're trying to get you back there so the hardest part you got gotta see who you're hanging out with man you gotta hang out with the people who you wanna be like the most yeah people will definitely drag you they'll jack it down and especially if you around someone who makes a lot of excuses and they're always failing oh this is just like they're they're the opposite of inspiration they're like a vacuum 100 sucking it out of you why are you doing that today man why are you getting up again so early why are you doing this why are you doing this the people you're hanging around will suck the [ __ ] life out of you yeah sometimes just gotta be alone man get your [ __ ] in and then there's also people that are gonna be around that are always failing and they're always [ __ ] up and then always coming to you to try to get you to help them exactly a giant burden yes never look in the mirror and get their own [ __ ] together they're always looking for external help that's right always looking for a storm people don't want to go in deep man all the ants are inside of you it's a very primitive way how like how this book is written it's primitive it's it's very barbarian it's how we all think it's how it's it's how man once walked the earth and then we get all soft and all these computers and [ __ ] we start going away from the the most powerful thing we have is our [ __ ] brain it's our mind and we don't use it anymore so you know it's like everything has to be so quick yeah you use your mind when it comes to certain things right but what you're saying is you don't use your mind when it comes to enduring exactly that is it you can't google that [ __ ] right hey let me google how to suffer no that ain't gonna be in there bro ain't gonna be in there it could be in there there's no answer it's not in there it doesn't exist find some water real cold and what's interesting is that that is a mind thing and people think of mind things they think of calculating mathematics literature no no no no no there's many aspects to the mind that's it don't overthink it yeah don't overthink it put your shoes on lace them up that's all you got to do my friend don't overthink the process yeah but see what because you've overcome and because you've accomplished so much now that even when you you talk about that moment of like embracing that suck like you see the big ass smile on your face like you've you've got a total different approach to it than the average person oh yeah the average person you're talking to them about doing chin ups for 24 hours or anything [ __ ] crazy they don't look at they're like oh there's like a a negative a doom feeling that's the thing about it man i talk about my book open-mindedness what separates me from a lot of people is they go into an a daunting task and the task is overwhelming like when i heard the pull-up break was 4020 pull-ups and i was talking about breaking this record people are like oh my god i went right to a pen and paper like what are you doing i'm doing the math man what are you talking about i'm open mind to the fact that okay if i do five pull-ups on the minute for so many hours i can get some pull-ups in how much time do i have to rest i was breaking the math down you have to be open-minded to the possibilities that i can do this once you shut your mind down to the possibility that it can be achieved there's no way it can happen so that's why my my eyes and my body light up about things because i know that if you're in a fight you have to attack you have to keep attacking the enemy has to know he is not going to give up you must break the soul of whatever the [ __ ] is in front of you that's what i realized i was never breaking the soul of anything in front of me so that's why i came with the thing called taking souls in my book i started to devise ways to break a soul of a human being of an object of whatever's in front of me if you keep on attacking something nothing wants to stand in front of anything that is relentless nothing the taken soul part of the book is really interesting because uh you talked about like the the mind shift that you had when you were in buds yes sir yeah that was that's an intense part of the book it's it is uh that's when a lot of stuff started clicking man i started watching those instructors on the side you know there's there's three shifts there's eight instructors three shifts because you know the guys going through through hell week they're up all day and all night for 130 hours this is the promised land of mental hardening for me i love this place and you have the instructors who you know you know they've been there done that now they're instructing you so they do their eight hour shift they have their parkas on it's usually cold coffee drinking their coffee and they're beating the crap out of us and when i started realizing i started playing mind games and i was like you know what i bet these [ __ ] are looking at us judging themselves about when they were going through hell week about let me see i'm looking at goggins right now i was better than him i was bearing that guy bearing that [ __ ] over there and i was like okay okay you gotta judge me right so it's not gonna do to you so what i started doing was i got my boat crew boat crew too it's in the book it's a great great story said come here guys you can't break boat crude you can't break broke crew 2. so it's wednesday is wednesday and everybody's broken everybody's beat up man and like this you start moving like a robot everybody's like just kind of just trying to get through helbig now and your energy zap and they know wednesdays like that over the hump i love that you talked about that in the book too that they put it in your head wednesday you're gonna be tired oh yeah and that's another thing they they tell you how you're supposed to feel so you are feeling that way i was like ah don't let these [ __ ] tell you how you supposed to feel no it's day one [ __ ] this is hour one so i was getting my broker all jacked up i said we're gonna take these [ __ ] souls so when they had us doing this simple thing that guys are struggling with broker two is just lost in the [ __ ] boat near yelling yeah he can't [ __ ] hurt us can't hurt boat crew too and i looked on the instructor's faces and it looked like someone had just [ __ ] with their soul and i looked at my guys my broker and i said hey guess what those [ __ ] aren't [ __ ] tonight because we own space in their [ __ ] head we own space they're gonna think about us tonight they could think about how they're killing boners that's right how how on wednesday are these guys doing this and screaming out you can't hurt people too we were we were bringing the fight we were attacking so so when you keep on doing that guess what people start doing i ain't [ __ ] with these guys no more so bro crew 2 got a lot more sleep roku 2 just became that broke like hey because we just kept charging and we started fueling off of that we started fueling out the fact that man it takes one second of energy to steal everybody's and then you have all the energy you need that's all you need you need to look at someone's eyes you know how this when you fight somebody you broke that [ __ ] he's like oh god man i don't want to go back the next round and you feel like my god i can fight all day i can fight all day long that's what taking souls is but you have to have the will the heart the courage to go that distance when you're exactly jacked up you have nothing left to give and give more that is an interesting thing about the mind is that you can find inspiration and when you find inspiration when you get charged up all of a sudden you have energy that's right it's right it's weird i talked about in the book also is about i learned how to control my adrenals if you know how you know how you get that fight or flight response when you get to move real quick yeah and you know i i started learning the mind a lot how to get myself jacked extremely fast like in a horrible environment when everybody's miserable i learned how to really find strength in the misery when everybody's suffering everybody's all poopy past and their mentality's down and everything i started just like my god this is where i shine and i started using all that misery for tons and tons of tons of drive and motivation to to then lead people further because you can get a lot of power through misery and once people see that my god cognizance is [ __ ] going then everybody says roger that let me get my [ __ ] and go too so i started realizing that if you can just find strength just a little bit longer you'll have a crew of people following you along the way and that is another thing that no one can ever teach you because you you're going to have to learn that on your own you're going to have to figure out how to pull that energy out of your mind on your own there's not there's there's no book you can read now all sudden i have it i've got the technique now i know how to do it yeah no it's it's a a grind that you have to start and finish on your own you have to take great pleasure in the fact that no one wants to be with the [ __ ] you're at right now great pleasure in that almost makes you know it has to bring a passion out of you it has to bring something very very weird out of you man like you know people don't really understand what that is when you're in the worst environment possible the worst situation possible and everybody's looking like god man i hope this ends and you see that time slows down and you see that you're you're feeling that everybody has that look on their face like god that's got to go i don't want to be anymore have you ever gotten rabdo wrapped on my lowest oh yes sir did you get it yes sir yes sir when did you get it i got it on my second pull-up record attempt and i talked about it a little bit in the book there um and i have sickle cell trait and a young kid just died from rhabdo from uh because sickle cell's not a good thing obviously um and rhabdo's a bad thing for having sickle cell you have sickle cell trait but you don't have the disease i don't have the disease a buddy of mine died from it when i was a kid really yeah a guy used to fight with us to train with yeah he was always sick he'd have it get sick his heart he'll be gone he'd be out of the gym for months and he'd come back and he'd just be trying to get his body back in shape again then he went up dying he's a talented guy too when you got it what did you have to do so they put me to hospital for a while um that's when my hand got real messed up and my fluids were extremely low and i had done like i think i did 3 000 pull-ups and they're like man your body is wrecked up were you just not drinking water while you're doing it i was drinking water but not enough so i was sipping this carbohydrate drink and um my calories were extremely low i didn't know how much i was going to burn through and you burn through an awful lot of calories man doing that many pull-ups so that many hours yeah and with the repetition with using the single points of just my hands and my biceps my back like my body was swollen like the pillsbury doughboy i mean it looked horrible and um so they kept me in there for a while but how long probably about eight hours i was about eight hours on ivs and stuff like that so they just it's basically a ton of drinks yeah tons of fluid and they sent me home though so i went home that night and how long did you wait before you jump back at it i think i was back on the pull-up bar about a week and a half later and then i broke the record six six weeks later i broke the record jesus christ so when you when you did get back on the pull-up bar was how [ __ ] up was your body from it was bad but what i do is like what i've done through everything it which isn't real smart i mean it works for me so i'm not saying do this is i've trained through a lot of my injuries and i started developing i i started doing that in buds and still training because i instill training you know they know you guys start from day one or they just kick you out so i started from day one enough so my third time going through i was really jacked up well you went you had pneumonia yeah i had pneumonia and i had really bad stress fractures so my stretch fracture so i was literally i would put a sock on and then duct tape my foot all the way up to the top of my or to the middle of my ankle or to my calf and because my stress fracture was so bad so like the pivot point between my ankle and my shin i just cast that all the way up and so i went through for several months for a few months with stretch fractures what was crazy about that is they healed by the time i got to third phase my stress reactions were healed wow and i don't even know how rhyme or reason behind it i ran on them a few months later they were healed wow so i don't know what that means just push through the agony and eventually your body just said this crazy [ __ ] is not gonna stop it's true statement yeah it's weird a lot of my injuries i've just pushed through and they've uh i duct tape it up i mean have you ever had to have surgery on any of them no just heart just a couple heart surgeries but um none of my actual physical body and what was your heart surgery for again you talked about this before yeah asd i had a hole in my heart yeah so which is even more ridiculous yeah that's what we talked about that too man they uh they they took me off and studied me for a while so they realized that my god i shouldn't even be in the military i wasn't even qualified to be in the military at the hole in my heart you know let alone being special operations where you jumping on planes and stuff like that so i was i was lucky how'd they seal that up so they went in with a helix patch and um you know through my femoral artery femoral artery and they went through put a patch and they realized you know i missed like three or four years of a military career because this heart surgery wow yeah so i was i was off of jump status dive status i was just uh so that's what i talked about recruiting so much i i stayed in recruiting for like three or four years and um you know i became like a navy city recruiter when i was uh you know doing this for a while so i got extended there because the heart surgery and other than that you never had to have any other surgeries um no meniscus no nothing no no that's crazy no and i've had some jacked up injuries let's see how i grew up you know like i talked about in the book my dad didn't believe in taking me by the hospital like that's just how it was man it was it was barbarian stuff man but you know you learn to deal with it and you live it you're fine you get hurt mris oh yeah get everything checked out matter of fact man i was terrified mri machine for a long time i was claustrophobic i was like man that's yeah there's a lot of there's a lot behind that man but yeah i've i've been checked out a lot i've had uh so like i said like six years ago i started stretching out like i thought i was dying i couldn't even get out of bed so all that stretching out was from pretty much all these injuries i had that i never really fixed and my body got knotted up and more knotted up and more knowledge i mean it's going to heal one way or another it's going to heal and when it heals and i can heal right it's going to heal all jacked up and crooked yeah so i'm a crooked jacked up dude man but i can still get it done it's amazing that you haven't had like knee surgeries or anything like that consider all the running you've done my left knee right now isn't it's no joke so like i say origin of pain my right foot is messed up because of my left knee so right now i'm i'm i'm taking care of my left knee knees getting a lot better now but don't worry cameron haynes i will still be [ __ ] out there running with your ass i'm not gonna get out of it buddy so if you're listening [ __ ] i will see you this weekend merry christmas all right just so you know brother merry christmas i'll see you soon you don't know what's wrong with the knee you have no idea it's from stretching so basically stretching yeah so my whole because my body was in in such bad alignment from just what i did to it that now i'm in this huge stress routine and my body's getting back into alignment so your muscles like i was a power lifter man like i i grew these huge muscles and i'm this small guy and i just and from the stress of my body going through three health weeks and also my body scout became one knot so as things start to open up joints start to hurt things start to hurt and i'm like god so it's been this big long process so i'm faster in better shape than ever my organs work better i'm healthier than ever but i have these little tweaks here these little tweaks there from the fact that i am now my body was locked into position from these muscles being so tight now what do you weigh now about 182 183 and you were at like 300 plus pounds when you're at your fattest right my fattest when i weighed in for the military i don't know what my fattest was but when i weighed in on that scale when steven sauzio hit that scale on me man it was 297. and he's like brother you gotta lose 106 pounds i was like [ __ ] this what are you talking about oh how's that possible so anyway it's just you know not a lot of time that's the crazy thing they didn't give you three months to lose that 33 pounds a month is a lot of [ __ ] weight plus a few almost impossible and that's what i thought that's what i thought but see you see the person now i was 175 pounds in high school so i was a skinny guy in high school so i made myself big i'm a small bone person so it didn't it wouldn't trust me it was hard it was hardest thing i've ever done in my life but what did people think around you when they saw you three months later you're 100 pounds lighter my mom couldn't believe it because my mom so i was living in indianapolis in the end at the time and so i was trying to study for this asvab test again that you know i got to take it again going to the navy and i'm out here trying to lose weight and i'm you know working for this company spraying for cockroaches and all sort of crap and i would lay in her pond in [ __ ] november in indiana just lay in her pond i was like i'm going to bust i got to get hard you know so i would lay in the pond get out of the pond and go for a run just all wet cold like my like the dad gone shirt would just freeze up from ice and [ __ ] and i just be out there running said what is wrong with you man like you were that kid who just didn't want to like what's wrong with you so she started seeing the transformation like you know this guy is obsessed with trying to become somebody next thing she knew man my god you actually lost that much weight that fast i love the fact that you did it but what what hurts me is when i hear stories about people that get like stomach stapling and surgery and all that [ __ ] that they do like you just need to just lose the weight right and if you just did it you just did it the right way you would have earned it and if you earn it you'll keep it that's the thing about it man like we like to take these very quick fixes in life we want the six minute abs approach to life yeah nah man there's no permanent in that yeah there's no permanent in that man there's no scarring there must be scarring well people are terrified of this thing that you're saying that there's no end that there's no finish line that every day is a new thing that you have to earn it still after all the [ __ ] you've done every day you get up and you have to earn it yes you know what's funny about that i want you to be scared of it yeah i want you to just give you fuel it's great motivation and see if you look at that way the reason why i speak the way i speak because i believe in what i'm saying if i ever shut it down that's the end of me and whatever my hundred percent will be i don't know what's gonna happen to me tomorrow if you can't run i will figure what the [ __ ] i can do and do that that would be my new 100 you must continue to find your new 100 whatever life throws at you you must find what you can do now i may become the best you know scientist of all time who knows watch out you know what i'm saying watch out who knows well that is an approach like this this approach this mental approach you can use that for anything once you get past the quitting mechanism of your mind once you get past that thing that this is applicable you can you can take these lessons that you learn from these grueling runs yes losing 106 pounds in three months from all these different things of struggle you can take these lessons of struggle and you can apply them to anything yes i talk about it in my book here about that race i did that made seal training look like a like a child's play in ranger school that that first hundred miler i did write [ __ ] on myself and all kind of stuff that 19 hours it took me with no training i sum it up like this you're talking about struggle how you can put so much of life into struggle in that 19 hours i lived five years five years of struggle of happiness of of depression success failure in 19 hours that's what's great about some of these things i do you get a a wide range of life in just 19 hours you know like when you get to like mile 50 in your mind saying we gotta get out of here man and then it gets like miles 60. okay we're feeling good you have all these highs and lows that you have to manage within this suck fest of 19 hours and that's what i get from a lot of these different things that human growth you know growth of the mind without friction there is no growth without friction there's no growth there's no growth and there's no satisfaction like there's no real like people want to sit around and rest but you don't really appreciate rest unless you earned it that's it and people get they think i'm the craziest person on the planet you are so far [ __ ] removed from that statement it's not even funny i was 290 pounds twice in my life i do not like to do the things i do but to humongous satisfaction from doing it this humongous has facts from lacing your shoes up saying i don't really want to go for a run today and then running and then getting back and saying wow i did it i did it yeah and that's what it's about it's about these small steps to doing things you don't want to do you know jocko jocko william i know him yeah jocko's don't know him great but i know him i i know him pretty well he's he's awesome but every morning you look at that motherfucker's instagram he's got a picture of his watch at 4 30. he gets up at 4 30 every morning and he earns a sunrise that's good stuff it works out like a [ __ ] and then earns a sunrise that's good stuff but it's that thing like there's no end no it doesn't end and it's scary that is scary that's scary everybody wants that holding hands while the sun sets retirement you're walking off into the sunset the biggest question i get is so when did you rest when did you recover yeah and i don't want to scare people but the truth answer is i don't take any days off no days no days seven days a week seven days a week what is a normal day normal day for me a normal day so let's say a light day light day light day is at least a seven mile run i will every every four every other day so about four days a week um calisthenics plus gym workout so i don't do any gym workout without hitting pull-ups push-ups i call nickels and dimes so like five pull-ups ten push-ups or i'll go you know quarters and whatever like it's like 25 pull-ups or in like 50 push-ups so i have all these different things i messed up so i will do weights with calisthenics and every single night i stretch for at least every night i stretch for these two hours two hours every night every night so you stretch after you're done working out yeah so at night time usually i'll be either in a quiet room or i'll be watching tv or a good i love sports be watching the game and i'm on the floor man and that's what i do so you just stretch while you're doing stuff i stretch where i do stuff two hours a long ass time to stretch is this just because you're trying to correct i'm trying to correct um years of not doing that no years of just do you ever [ __ ] with yoga a lot yeah yoga is this [ __ ] what do you do i have my own yoga so i kind of invented my own little yoga for what my body needs i've done hot yoga several times yoga is huge yoga shoes like holding those positions and i'm big and holding them for a long period of time so that's where my stretching like people say don't hold stretches for a long time i hold them for a long period of time because i'm trying to get full range of motion a lot of people going for like like um like my shoulders all messed up i get surgery on it nah if you don't have full range of motion in your body don't go in and get cut on man until you know that your body is actually opened up you know we start to get knuckle dragger syndrome from doing these push-ups you never work your back you know like like i'm like i'm your rear delts so here you are you start hunching over before you know your joints are out of whack you need to get full range of motion before you know how [ __ ] up you truly are so i'm i'm always working on full range of motion like a kid they run so effortlessly they're always in full range of motion as you get older and tighter and sick and more stressed your body starts to get more and more tight therefore your shoulders start to get out of balance not a and not a joint not a socket therefore you know it's popping yeah it's popping because you're [ __ ] tight open it up first open it up can you can can you touch your hands behind each other and raise them up behind you you know it's all these different ranges of motion that i got real smart on from a guy and i took it to another level so are you do you work with a trainer or do you always work out by yourself everything i do i've never had training my entire life really never not one time do you read about physiology or exercise science or anything like that nothing nothing nothing but what about like when they learn new [ __ ] about new ways to you know enhance shoulder stability or new exercises you're not interested no i don't i don't i don't i don't do it for that reason still this day man still this day to this day it is for me to become better mentally how i look has just become like i have thousands thousands hundreds of thousands of miles on this body running pull-ups push-ups swimming whatever you want to call it this body is what it is now it's from repetition it's not from studying you know hey if you hold your plank for this long [ __ ] all that [ __ ] i don't i don't care about it i just do it for my mind right i want to continue to harden because that's the only thing i want that's what i want i want to have that mind ready for life but you also want to increase your range of motion oh yeah yeah range of motion make sure that you're you're you know you're not causing any additional injuries dude wouldn't you want to like stabilize some areas that maybe you feel like you might have weaknesses and find out new techniques to do that have you seen me with my shirt off no yeah it's stable as [ __ ] i saw you when you had your shirt off when you first came here i walked in he dave got here early and uh by the time i got here he was already doing chin-ups yeah it's stable stable do some pull-ups push-up smash some stable [ __ ] yeah but yeah but you you know all that stuff is very important honestly just all jokes aside man full range of motion getting your shoulder rotation all that stuff is very important i i learned a lot about that coming up i had a lot of people i worked out with that that are real smart about all this stuff i'm a real old-school meat-eater like bill casmire type of lifter you know i don't look like it back when i was that guy in the back of the skinny guy that that's what i did and i got off really big into human performance about the body strength fitness that's what i wanted to be i want to be a hybrid [ __ ] a guy that can run 200 miles and then go to the gym with your meat head who doesn't even who's scared of running and lift with him so that's my whole thing in life i want to be the guy who can run 200 miles with the skinny guys and then go to the gym with the big meat head and say okay load it up let's go so that's my whole thing that's a very difficult thing to to tie the two of them together when you think most people when you think ultra marathon runners or people that run long distances they're very thin right very thin guys like when you were talking about the first time you ran 100 miles that you did deadlifts the night before like that is just [ __ ] preposterous nobody does that no yeah so me and the guy talk about the book it's silverback gorilla is what i call him in the book that's not his real name obviously but yeah he saw me go into my car the night before my first hundred mile race and you know i was like he called me out say hey goggins come here you know when the navy still calls you out gotta put you through three hell weeks you're like you know what [ __ ] i gotta go to the gym and lift heavy now so we're doing squats deadlifts power cleans heavy bench presses and i'm thinking i have to run 100 miles tomorrow but i also knew he was coming out there to watch me so i was like you know what you put me through three hell weeks you were my instructor so now it's my turn to educate you on what a human can do because i know you could be sitting there thinking while you're watching me with your wife and your kid and you just worked out with me not before we went real heavy did the heaviest [ __ ] when we're sore you're you're gonna sit there while you watch me run around this one mile track how the [ __ ] is he doing that [ __ ] right now we lifted heavy as hell and he's running 100 miles and never has run past 20 miles in his life i use that for a lot of fuel so that gym workout mr silverback gorilla there was a lot for my mentality that that brought with me because i knew i would see you and he came at mile 50 with a package of six donuts that i chomped up with the quickness so yeah so i used that workout for a lot of motivation i knew he'd see me i know he'd be thinking about how did you not get robbed over that day you know what i don't know what i got that day but i talked about in the book again that when i went home that night or that morning that was single-handedly nothing even close i'm 43 years old now there's nothing even close to that pain i knew for a fact i wasn't going to get out of that tub i knew i i knew i was done i was talk about dehydrated no nutrition i was eating rich crackers and my plex that was the worst pain i'd ever experienced in my entire life i was pissing coca-cola out of me it was bad it was bad she probably did have rob dog i guarantee it i i guarantee i'm pissing god cold that's coca-cola no bueno yeah no brain no son it was bad and my ex-wife was like [ __ ] and she's you know she's a nurse yeah and she called my mom up and mom had a her friend there was a was was a doctor friend of hers said hey you gotta give them to the doctor immediately and i was like hey you gotta give me that [ __ ] phone i gotta call up chris kaufman let him know i did 100 miles so i get in the bad water it didn't go as like you know like i planned but i did get in the bad water after another race but um but didn't you do a marathon like yes later so basically i had never run a marathon right i did the 100 mile race first no training but i had signed up for the marathon because it's the first las vegas marathon running down the strip of las vegas so las vegas had you know had a marathon but it's the first time it's going to go down the strip 2005 like hey i'm gonna sign up for it i went on to iraq did you know the deployment and i come back i'll be training for it and i'll go do this race with my family me my ex-wife and my mom signed up for it so in iraq me and my boy sledge in the book we're just working out we're like we're doing crazy workouts and my cardio was 20 minutes every sunday on the elliptical trainer that's the only cardio i did so i called myself training for this marathon right so then you know my my boys got killed in in that incident that happened long survivor you know the whole operation red wings so that's what prompted me to do the 100 mile race after the 100 mile race in november it was like two or three weeks later that marathon that we all signed up for that i didn't train for i didn't train for 100 miles didn't doing training off of this like hey i'll drive there with you all because i tried to run the day before like i can't even run i can't run down the block so i didn't do it so we we're driving to the race i said hey mom my mom's going to walk it i said i'm going to walk it with you my ex-wife i said you can go ahead and take off do your thing run your race i'm gonna walk my mom that gun went off and something [ __ ] happened i took i was like what i took up like a jack rabbit gone i was like what the hell so i re i was thinking the whole time i was like man i couldn't i spent a hundred miles like three weeks ago like first time ever my i was peeing blood and pissing [ __ ] on myself i go my body's broken my my achilles and my tendons and my feet are broken i go what is this and every time i started running further in front okay i got to the 10k i'm on boston marathon time because i knew the boston marathon was like 3 10 59 for my age i'm like hang on a second and then i started using all this external [ __ ] for motivation like okay who the [ __ ] can go out here and run a hundred miles no training like i'm broken most broken i've been in my life now i'm running a marathon who could do it so i started just feeding myself feeding myself i get to half the mile i'm about 30 seconds off the pace i say hang on man your goggins you can do this [ __ ] man and i started feeding myself feeding myself feeding myself you can do this before i knew it man i kept talking to like the last six miles and i was off the pace and i just kicked it and that next thing i knew i did like a 308 and change i was like and that was like what the [ __ ] what have i been leaving on the table right i've been leaving so much on the [ __ ] table for pain like and that's when i started like going crazy about the mind like what the hell am i like what is up like open these different doors of like possibility in like what is humanly possible what are we capable of like you know people i didn't even know i was just amazed by what i was able to do by a simple fact of just reasoning and working with pain and pain management and in my mind just kept on growing from there and it happened in hell week it happened a hundred mile race happened here it started just evolving into what it is now to where now i'm like god dawg man of mine we are leaving so much on the table but people take me he cusses so much she sounds crazy don't listen all that [ __ ] man just just cut off the [ __ ] cut the [ __ ] just get to the weeds of that you are you are [ __ ] yourself up by not examining your brain you're not examining your brain message it that's done you examine your [ __ ] brain and that takes some hard work and suffering if you're not willing to do that i'm sorry and it seems like there's no way to do that as a bystander no you can't watch it man yeah you gotta get out there like oh this hurts this hurts real [ __ ] bad i don't think this is smart and then guess what happens the body will adjust it will adjust anybody goes well then the next question i get but is there a time when it doesn't adjust what the [ __ ] i get some of the stupidest [ __ ] man like don't don't take it with a grain of [ __ ] salt people those questions are people that are wanting to quit yes yes and that's what i say when should i quit yeah like uh did you ever like feel like no shut the [ __ ] up stop stop i don't want to like that there's always that next question no don't take it like go out there and run through a brick wall as many times as you can no i'm not saying be me don't run 205 miles at one time i'm not saying do that i'm saying start to learn the mind is powerful it's powerful man it's it's unbelievable but people need they need a thing to get them going right they need a thing right they need a goal they need they need a like it's sometimes the first step is the hardest like it's hard to take that one million step too but sometimes the first step is the most there's something about the what do i do they start going over their phone they start calling people they don't get out of the house right and there's something about procrastination it's like you know it's painful you know you should be doing things but you just keep doing it you keep itching that scab [Laughter] i procrastinate like a [ __ ] man every day i'm gonna do this [ __ ] that's what's so funny man people looking like i'm some damn superhero that came down from the gods from the heavens of earth no man i don't want to do this [ __ ] i'm looking at my shoes for 30 minutes sometimes thinking man [ __ ] man people people look up to you goggins [ __ ] them i don't wanna do this i'm like i wanna do this [ __ ] man but guess what you do it i'm gonna do it as long as you do it and that's what i know about it man that's why i stopped doing i'm thinking oh man you're gonna [ __ ] sit here you look at your shoes for 30 40 minutes you go you got to think about it all day long and you go do it anyway and sometimes you don't have the time to look at issues for 30 minutes no those are the those are the beautiful days yes because you know you just have to go that's right and so like there's no room for procrastination and that's when i was in the military i love my schedule because i knew how to work at seven o'clock so you better get your ass up at four o'clock man you get your [ __ ] in brother cause i had to get my [ __ ] in before i got my [ __ ] in right you know so that was my mentality back then man you know like i i had to get the miles and get everything in man and and get to work man i'm uh competing with the alpha males yeah but how much did that piss other alpha males off that you were you were imposing a very high bar i i was a very misunderstood human being when i was in the military the air force guys liked me a lot the rangers liked me a lot so much not the seals because they were with you they they didn't like me so much which is fine you know i i respect them i think a lot of them respect i've have a lot of friends in the seal teams a lot of guys that like like-minded mentalities as me and once again i grew up and i got over it a lot of guys still have you know like a lot of people can't get over the fact of whatever when i became a seal recruiter a lot of guys thought i wasn't deploying for a lot of reasons and whatnot and they i heard a lot i was that guy who grinded i grinded hard i mean i i grounded hard i was that guy who was up like if we went on an op or we had a work up let's say we had a work up we're an island we're out there shooting guns and and doing land warfare and we did it like one o'clock in the [ __ ] morning most everybody go to sleep i didn't go to sleep i went to the gym and i worked out or i'd go sleep and i said we'd be up at five o'clock i was up at four o'clock and got my hour in i made sure to always do that and i i did it to a point to where i think it pissed some people off because i i want a quiet person about it you know i i uh i want the most humble person always you know so when you're around alpha males um you're sometimes picking a fight you know all the time and i looked different i acted different i was different i am different i take a lot of pride in that and so you know if if you didn't get after it i didn't respect you because i believe that you know where where i'm at i i know that human potential is what we have it's all we have is what we the the world sees us a certain way and when i saw that people weren't doing that i had a funky ass [ __ ] attitude and i i own it in my book i come back from ranger school a big time leader i was a big time [ __ ] leader i got honor man out there i live by example and what i realized a lot of times when you're in these schools these schools people want to graduate these schools because they suck they don't want to ever go back to these schools those schools became my [ __ ] life people don't want to see a [ __ ] god that wants to go back to day one week one a [ __ ] navy still training every [ __ ] day of your life and that's how i live and it's a disgusting human being that i can be it is and a lot of people didn't like me a lot of [ __ ] people started some stupid [ __ ] and started saying this and that the bottom line man is my [ __ ] resume says it all man my resume is out there google the [ __ ] you say whatever you want to say about me man i i i miss some deployments man for having [ __ ] you know two heart surgeries and people trying to start some rumors [ __ ] on me man you started rumors [ __ ] on me man because i [ __ ] got the [ __ ] after it and real hard guys like a guy named hawk i talked to all the time yeah he's a great friend of mine when the hardest my first before my heart surgery my second heart surgery i went on a 10 mile wreck around before my second heart rate the day of it i went on a 10 mile work on 50 pounds i saw that guy he's like what the [ __ ] are you doing out here he got heart surgeon it's roger that brother i'm getting it in before i'll be out for about six months after the heart surgery that was my mentality because i started realizing at a young age when i was leaving on the table and once i found out what a human being's capable of i didn't know how to control that i was i was a [ __ ] talk about [ __ ] savage that's what i was i was a [ __ ] straight up people talk about savage very lightly i was [ __ ] from the back woods [ __ ] savage dude you know and and i just i was just i was i told you what i thought i i had eight chips on my shoulder i um and a lot of times that wasn't great so is it a situation where like with the seals where once you've gotten through buds and once you've gotten through all the physically grueling parts of getting to be accepted once you're in then you were imposing standards that they didn't want to they didn't want to keep up with i i would say some people you know i i had uh i had one platoon that i had a problem with you know like i like i i i graduated ranger school and i got in this platoon and i didn't see i don't know i was in charge of a pt program and you put me in charge of the pt program it's [ __ ] your ass and the thing about it i didn't like it either i didn't i didn't want to do this [ __ ] either man but what were you making them do like you know like i it was it was some maybe it was some bud [ __ ] you know we went back to buzz like you know long peak tees and carrying logs over the berms and [ __ ] and like i had us do like pull-ups rope climbs pull up like for like a [ __ ] hour so imagine doing a rope climb then go do like 10 to 15 pull-ups coming back and we would do like these they were very hard workouts like there was no like go to the gym lift some weights type of [ __ ] and i was imposing my own mentality on everybody these are grown ass [ __ ] men they know you know they don't want to be what i'm trying to make them to be and when they called me off like hey you know we're not in sealed you know we're not in buds anymore goggins it pissed me off and i uh and i got a little [ __ ] attitude got my chip and i got my ball and me me and sledge went ahead and started to work out together and we developed this like me and sleds work out like [ __ ] girl animals and we had this [ __ ] mentality of [ __ ] yeah we're getting answered every day and everybody's kind of did their own thing man and i just that's when i started looking at people you know not just but people very differently man cause i bit into like you know like to be the special operator you gotta be have broken legs and these guys all those stories i was the same guy man i i put people on a pedestal i put people like i could never be them i could never be that guy man never put anybody on a pedestal that's what happened to me i put him on a pedestal once i got up there with him and i saw him and once again not everybody some hard [ __ ] out there dude period dot hard [ __ ] i thought every [ __ ] was hard hey hey uncommon amongst uncommon men that's all it was about for me man and i took it to another level and i pissed a lot of [ __ ] off and they were trying to find chinks in my armor then they were they were trying to find chinks in the armor you know all he does is run all he does is [ __ ] run that's why you know but once again i don't talk about the military too much like i said the air force loved me the army guys i work with love me the ranger school all that stuff love me you know i wasn't you know it's just what it is man it's uh i was part of the navy seals i was a i was a team guy but i wasn't part of the brotherhood and that's just me man that's just me it ain't saying nothing bad about them i got a lot of love for a lot of them love them a lot ain't got love for me but i'm gonna talk bad about them it's just i'm different that's something i figured out i'm different from everybody in the [ __ ] world and i had to own that and say you know what man you made a lot of [ __ ] mistakes being it's uh being who you are and i should have been more of a leader at times but a lot of times a lot of people should have been a little bit harder too so was it that some of those guys just didn't want to work as hard or was it just that they were they weren't appreciating how competitive you were you were always against them is that what it was that it didn't foster the sense of brotherhood because you were more like come on [ __ ] i i i didn't really call them [ __ ] but you could look at my face and how i looked at you and you know you can you can kind of say this you know so what happens i started developing this like this separation another thing about me too man i don't go out i don't party i don't hang out with the guys i don't you know so i was always forming this kind of separation i'm a big time introvert you know i do my job and i don't want to see your [ __ ] ass again i'm gonna go home refresh and we'll see you again you know you're in a platoon with these guys for two two years sometimes year and a half and i would you know we work up do our [ __ ] and i i'm just i'm just a different [ __ ] cat i'm a different cat man like i uh you know i just i i think differently i i believe differently um and i i believe strongly what i believe in well some people must appreciate the fact that you were self-motivated and that you were pushing the envelope that you were pushing the pace you were setting a high bar yeah i have a lot of guys right now within the community a lot of a lot of guys once again this is like it's like a big soap opera sometimes man when you know when we when you're in a fraternity like that that's what it's like man so i had to get a different vantage point look at it and see like you know a lot of guys did respect who i was and what i did and um i i brought it [ __ ] hard a lot and every day but i also rub people the wrong way i'm like that itch you're talking about i'm like that itch you want to scratch the [ __ ] out my ass no sir you wanna just like [ __ ] this dude man i love what you talked about when you ran the marathon you realize how much you were leaving on the table because that is um i mean i think the the unfulfilled potential is the story of most people's lives it is it is it and it could have been the story of mine and i tell a lot of people people go what's your biggest fear in life and my biggest fear honestly was let's say this let's say uh i don't care if you believe in god or not i don't care so this let's just play a game with me let's say let's say you're god and we have a big [ __ ] long line of people and i made to heaven 75 years old i'm 300 pounds i made heaven i worked for ecolab my entire life praying for cockroaches that's what i did but i'm dead i'm in heaven now and you are at you're you're judging us all now so we're in line we're all sitting there in line you have adam brown he has a big board up and you're talking to adam brown about his life and you rip it down and i'm next in line david goggins i see my name and i see all this [ __ ] and god goes hey you say read this man and i'm reading this list and i'm seeing 182 pounds navy seal ranger school motivational speaker changing lives okay man pull up record all this [ __ ] and i'm like that's not me man and god looks at me and says that's who you were supposed to be and my biggest fear i i visualize some crazy [ __ ] my biggest fear is that one day i want to reach a judgment of my life someone something is going to judge me what the [ __ ] i was supposed to be in life and what i want now is that whoever's judging me whatever judge me up there i want them to have a board and them up there right now getting their pin out because you know this person who judges supposed to know everything supposed to know from the time you're dead the time you're you know you know time you're born time you're dead i want this person up there to be like this up there writing more about me saying [ __ ] i know i know you could do that i i know you can do that so i want to impress whatever the [ __ ] is up there whatever's going on in life i want to go up there and not have anything left on the table i want to i want to drain my soul of every [ __ ] bit of person i am now how do you plan on doing that but going forward in the future do you have a plan yeah so what i did i i believe in going back to scratch so a lot of us like right now i've i've come a long way in my life i've had to grow up a lot except a lot of the [ __ ] things i've done in my life i'd accept a lot i took all this information big database took it all so what got me to be where i'm at today is data i collect even more data now which way i can write this book which i can tell people hey you know i [ __ ] have a lot of faults i have a mentality that can sometimes rub people all this [ __ ] so how you get better is so right now i'm way up here now i was way down here but what makes you way up here is being from way down here so i love going back i called so when i was growing up for like three years so from time i was eight to time i was like 12 we live in a seven dollar a month place and what i call it is i'm always paying rent in that seven dollar a month home every day of my life i go back and revisit that place because that place made me this geranimal that place made me this hard man and then from that place so that that place is hard work that place is going back to the fundamentals of life the fundamentals what made david gaga's david goggins going back in there going back to the going back to the library of david goggins studying even more than what i know taking that out going back to where i'm at now and then moving forward so i believe in always taking steps backwards to to your roots we we cannot forget the roots and what made us the geranimal we can never become civilized isn't it granite that like little kids clothes it's a little kid's clothes but i love the word i love his clothes or drinks i don't know his clothes or drinks man but something like that so when when you when you're living like right now like what kind of goals are you setting and how how are you how are you how are you feeding that beast inside of you how are you calming all that down stretching helped a lot you know so when you wire yourself up so much yoga yoga and stretching has really helped me to like you want to be quiet in your mind to see where you want to go because noise is the ultimate kryptonite too much noise in your mind you're not going to be focused on what the task at hand is it's one of the things that i found like long cardio so the best thing ever for calming that noise yes we all talked about that all the guys that i did that sober october thing with the fitness challenge that like if you work out five hours a day you don't give a [ __ ] no it's it's amazing i'm like if you could take that and put it in a pill form how you feel about life after you work out five hours yep you don't give a [ __ ] nothing bothers you like nothing you nothing because you've struggled true my fiancee right now it's like hey i got xyz i'm like i'll take you she's like what you won't look at shoes i'll take you like what i'm like i just worked out for four hours man i [ __ ] sit down this [ __ ] chair all day long son yeah yeah i'm chill it's different yeah i i get all that [ __ ] out i ring the rag out in the morning time and whatever you want to do i'm here man most people never get there though no they always have that chatter always it was negative anger the guy who cut you off yesterday oh yeah all day still on your head yep all day long man chatter challenge maybe i should do this maybe i should have done that i should never let that guy get away with that exactly i should have done this i should have taken that job oh i should have moved i should have stuck with her all that that was me man yeah that was my people yeah why don't people like me amazing that that long cardio just calms that chatter like that though yes like i i never uh until october i've never really done long cardio every day it beats that testosterone up man beats everything up yeah that test you're like [ __ ] done yeah you're cool yeah you're cool man it's not just that it's like it's i always talk about people's brains that i think that the the way people's minds work that we're like a battery that's like leaking out it's like since we don't use it because we have all this potential we don't use it like it oozes off the top of the batter and it gets messy right it's going down the sides of the battery it's all [ __ ] up but when you just drain that [ __ ] like nature intended like give you the potential to run away from predators avoid invading tribes and to fight and gather and hunt and all the physical potential that your body is capable of when you do drain it with like a 10 mile run or right long cardio session long workout session then you can just be you it's the great purge man the purge it's the purge you purge all that [ __ ] demon [ __ ] out man all the evil evil can't stay in a 10 mile run bro it's going to get leaked right the [ __ ] out it does it gets pounded out pound it out yeah but you could see things clean more clearly and that is only available through effort i mean maybe it's available through meditation i don't know but i feel like there's a different thing that's available through effort because there's also a satisfaction of accomplishment oh yeah effort's huge man it means everything because you gotta feel good about yourself now what do you do you plan out your future i do so i'm very go so i have that accountability mirror but i also plan on all my small big time you know medium goals all these things i have to do in life i'm a big planner i'm a big planner so you know right now i'm going back to scratch so i'm trying to be wildland firefighter you know i did that for a couple seasons you're gonna do that now yeah so i did it for i did it for two not not full season but but two half seasons so this year was my second year doing it i had to i had to um stop about two months before it ended because of this book to start promoting the book and start finishing the book up but i've been doing the opportunity that's some [ __ ] work man those [ __ ] guys get after what made you decide to do that the work you know like when your hands stop becoming really calloused it's time to get back to work you know like i retired from the military i did 21 years in the military um the military was my life loved everything about it the discipline of it um there's something about going back in the in the money you make is nil it's not about the money at all it's just about the hard work i've always been looking for those people like those guys like you're out there digging a three mile fire line literally a three mile fire line you're cutting down these [ __ ] huge ass trees to dig this fire line and the fire line is like 20 to 18 inches for three miles and you get like [ __ ] 12 people digging this [ __ ] and i'm thinking man this is some of the hardest [ __ ] work i've done in my life and it's that challenge that you can't find sometimes by going to the gym or by running you know 100 mile race is that it's that new challenge of like hey and you get done digging all right you work 17 hours 16 17 hours you get your [ __ ] little [ __ ] sleeping mat out shack down boom right there on the floor right there on the ground get up dig some more you know be out there two three weeks sometimes man it's doing that [ __ ] and there's great satisfaction in the kind of work that you do out there no one's watching no one gives a [ __ ] it's hard dangerous [ __ ] work and you know you're doing it to help [ __ ] out man you know how did you get drawn into that so i got drawn into it because i was always looking for the next challenge and i was like hey what is there after the military like what the [ __ ] is there man i'm i'm 43 um i'm getting back in shape you know i'm [ __ ] getting these health issues taken care of that i had and i started once again google is amazing [ __ ] hardcore [ __ ] jobs you know pretty much you know hard-ass [ __ ] you know that's i found the horse you know like the first race you know hardest races in the world so basically i started finding this wildland fire fight like what the [ __ ] is wildland firefight started googling that started googling smoke jumpers you know i'm like what the [ __ ] these guys do what they jump out of planes and attack small fires like that's the [ __ ] so i'm like okay okay we could put down a list and okay hot shots what's the hot shot dude they go out with you know big fires and they dig fire line they i'm like [ __ ] with nick from that and i saw a video of it like that [ __ ] looks like it sucks it's hot you know there's lim you know i mean you're out there on your own i mean you know you're out there on your own man just digging a fire line so that's kind of how i found it i'm always looking for the next challenge i'm never satisfied with oh i did that like you know i became a seal i was an air force guy i became a seal i went to ranger school i tried out for delta force twice you know like i'm always looking for what is next looking for those uncommon men and women uncommon people because i'm trying to i'm trying to grow i'm trying to grow and a lot of times you know you don't be the only person that's making yourself grow you're looking for those cameron haynes those joe rogan those people who are like just different people who understand what the [ __ ] they're saying because a lot of things i have to say i can't say them all i can't say them all you may not understand them so i had to really find a way to communicate with people so they don't think oh my god like what what did you just say so these cameron haynes is these joe work these people get it so i go in those little those little nucleus spots get get a little more strength get a little more knowledge get a little more tools take those tools with me put in my tool shed and i go off down you know down the road on a new journey so that's what i do well the proof is in the pudding if you're really doing woodland firefighting because there's no glory in that no sir no there's no fame there's no there's no one taking pictures of you no and that paycheck is small son i'mma [ __ ] make you wanna should i eat today yeah wow yeah there's there's nothing involved in that man they worked their ass off so but you're just doing it as a challenge that's it did they freak out when you're there you know what i i think they're wondering why is a 43 year old retired man you know all the stuff you've done why are you out here yeah and i explain it to them i'm out here i'm out here you know to to learn from you all to grow and also to never forget where i came from you know that's where it starts it's that mentality of i'm gonna pick up that [ __ ] pulaski and i'm gonna dig this [ __ ] fire line for three damn miles that's that mentality i never want to lose i never want to get so nice oh yeah i did it man i did it i did it i'm good that mentality of i'm willing to pick up that shovel and i'm willing to dig a three-mile line is th there's something about that mentality that i'm ready to go to work at any time and that's what keeps me those are the sparks like you know i look at motivation as just a spark it's like it's like kindling you know how how a big fire starts it starts with a little smoke it starts with a little cigarette being thrown in the woods next thing all californians [ __ ] burn up that's what i've been doing my whole life is i find these little sparks and once that little thing takes off that's a that's a one hour fuel then you've got 10 hour fuel then you can move that thing to a 10 000 hour fuel these big logs and big trees that burn for days and that's where you want to bring that motivation that's where you want to bring that drive so if you have no kingling the kindling is me going out with these young guys saying all right [ __ ] you're 43. it's a 20 year old keep up with them that kindling now when i leave those young guys it has now become that ten hour fuel and now that ten thousand dollar fuel that i use throughout my whole life i use that there my whole life man hey this summer at 43 you went out there and you did that man so you know you're not giving up yet you're not done yet not today you're not done today that's a crazy choice to make though woodland firefighter is a very interesting choice it is it is it's a nasty job man because again that's that's proof of concept like you're really just doing just for the struggle that's it is there other things you considered like that um so i will i apply for smoke jumping this year so i'll be out smoke jumping this year you know god willing um that's where it's at now that that right now is my next military that's my next military and that's it's always about human growth it's not about money it's not about money human growth that's the biggest like i said my biggest trophy that's why i turn down 300 thousand dollars the biggest trophy in life is what i've learned like this brain if i could put this brain in somebody's head and say here you go merry christmas they'd be a happy person what i found out is that with no crowds no one cheering for you no races no finish line it's an amazing amazing thing i've learned in my mind by no one cheering you on like like what that is is every morning i do what i do i don't have a trainer waking me up there's no one saying david you have to do this i don't have to do anything anymore i've done it that's the beauty of all this knowing that everything i talk about no one even knows what the [ __ ] i'm doing every day and i know that i am grinding like a [ __ ] they see a one minute video let me run in or some [ __ ] hopefully it motivates you merry christmas dude i'm out there for [ __ ] hours every [ __ ] day and no one sees what the [ __ ] i'm doing no one it's a great beautiful thing man that is a beautiful thing about it right that you really are just doing it for the benefits of it that's it that you have to do it that way it's not for show like there's a lot of people like you'll see like they have a little video they do on instagram like [ __ ] you are not doing that for very long you're going too fast that's it that's it this is not real i got my one minute on yeah take now yeah yeah yeah exactly this is so much a visit for show i do enjoy those videos that you're doing on instagram though we appreciate these little motivational things i put some of them up on my page i appreciate it we posted it there's a those are those are great man like would you are you just like do you just get a thought in your head while you're out there running you just want to get it down yeah so what i'll do is i my fiance does all these videos man so god bless you it's sometimes it'll be three o'clock in the [ __ ] morning and i'll be working out and i said hey wake the [ __ ] up i got some [ __ ] and she's like what like hey man it came to me man i got some [ __ ] for these people man so that's what happens like usually when i'm working out i get this great inspiration i some people might think it's [ __ ] but my my mind works best under extreme pain and suffering like oh my god i want to be out here and that's when i'm going deep into the cellar of my mind and that's when all that gargoyle [ __ ] starts to come up man you know what i'm saying and so she gets called out all the time like hey i'll run home and say hey get the car meet me at 17th street because by that time i have all my [ __ ] together so that's how this happens man it's not like a rehearse thing that's why sometimes i may post on monday usually it's like every monday but sometimes it's tuesday sometimes it's thursday you know i and that's what i do i i'm trying to now give back to people in a way that's real and authentic and just being me what is the response been like like after you did the podcast the first time what was the response like and what is the response like on social media what was crazy man is that you are my usher and i'm [ __ ] bieber that's the [ __ ] response man so your crowd um for some reason they they resonate with me they they understand they they they get me and they they love the message and like so if you put some [ __ ] up on my site i i block and delete your ass this ain't this ain't a playground like like my site i'm not [ __ ] around with you [ __ ] i want to give you some tools that i learned if you want to take them take them if not merry christmas i'll go on my merry way i don't care so if you go on there you want to play around and you want to you know whether they called um those people going inside troll [ __ ] ain't trying my [ __ ] i'm going gonna block your monkey ass off my [ __ ] quick i want so i i've been friends jamie yeah tell them so i've developed like a small community of people who can go in there and it's not just me talking so people have now joined in and they're i've seen people lose 150 pounds on my site man like and they're writing about and they're starting to break themselves down like i broke myself down they're like hey i went through this i went through this divorce and this happened and i tried to kill myself it gets raw and then people are now going on and commenting on their [ __ ] saying hey keep it up do what you're doing it's become like a big [ __ ] like hey it's a community of people trying to [ __ ] get better and that's what it's about man this ain't about the david goggins [ __ ] show no man i'm mr kingly you [ __ ] take this [ __ ] and let the [ __ ] burn also you probably need all these other people out there grinding two for fuel oh man i want to know that's the thing now like people go what motivates you now what motivation now is that there's over 600 some odd thousand people looking at me saying [ __ ] goggins is somewhere out there he's somewhere out there [ __ ] getting after it and i am so you ain't never [ __ ] alone i'm out there somewhere 600 some thousand people there's a chance that when you're working out i don't care if you're in [ __ ] washington dc and i'm in nashville there's a good chance at the same time we're getting after it and i want people to know that and it's the real deal we are getting after it together not no like happy family [ __ ] but we're getting after it you know yeah well that is that's giant for people man that the sense of community and to know that there's like-minded folks out there that are also trying to improve they're trying to overcome their own demons get past their own [ __ ] and squash their own weaknesses callous up their own mind i love that you know it's not time for some soft [ __ ] it's not time for soft [ __ ] man this isn't a [ __ ] playground don't come on my instagram facebook or twitter talking some [ __ ] come on if you want to if you want to join the community and get hard and see what you're about don't talk about rest you know how do you do it no let's [ __ ] stop thinking so much and let's put the shoes on and get grinding you do get some of that though there's some comments that say you know this is terrible advice rest and recovery is the most important thing god you ain't all my [ __ ] son you're not gonna last no my sight yeah i wanna hear that [ __ ] there's a lot of people looking for built-in excuses they are man they are they're looking for it but then there's a lot of people also that are just really interested in personal growth they're they're interested in really finding out what they're made of they're interested in improving their ability to toughen up and discipline themselves and they're looking they're looking for people like you and other people just add to that momentum right once you get going it's easier to keep going that's it man once you get going it's easier to keep showing up it is it is you have to get past that hurdle yeah and once you get past it man you're flying and then you see other people that are doing it too and you realize like this is a this is a movement there's a lot of other people out there it is a movement yeah it is a movement well that's the thing that resonates with you i think about the audience of this podcast that i've had quite a few people on that have that same message and it resonates with people because we're all trying to improve ourselves no one's perfect nope there's no i'm not perfect now i never will be you're not and you never will be but you're better than you were yesterday and you're gonna be better tomorrow that's the truth thing right there man that's that book says i am not [ __ ] perfect man i had the balls to now finally tell you all i am very flawed but in that saying that you're very flawed and saying that you're very perfect you exhibit way more strength than someone who bullshits and pretends right someone who puts up some fake ass [ __ ] fake facade of perfection right of moral integrity and growth and honesty and those people are a real problem because it's exhausting how the [ __ ] i did it for a while i'm like i can't hey i'm [ __ ] up i give up i quit i quit i quit i'm [ __ ] up i'm gonna tell you all i can't do this anymore this is who i am but the confidence of you of constantly grinding and constantly putting in that work is what leads you to be able to express yourself so honestly oh you're right i i for the first time believe in david goggins and i don't care who else believes in me i don't care for the first time in my life man i can tell you all my [ __ ] up [ __ ] and without lying that's powerful no longer care that's powerful that see everybody could get to that then you do you don't have any excuses because you don't need any that's right you don't need anything none you don't like me merry christmas [ __ ] kwanzaa keep moving that's it go yeah that's it good luck to you okay exactly yeah we're all in this thing together yeah you got your own path you didn't want us to stare at those shoes for 30 minutes every day that's so true man that's so true so fire jumping and woodland firefighting i didn't expect that i didn't hear that coming yeah that's interesting man yep and what did you have any other options that you were looking at before you dived into those you know what those are the first that came up because i saw how hard it was you know like at 43 in these jobs like like in the military you're a dinosaur time to retire and while in firefighting you know you start to move into these desk jobs and that was the challenge of it you know i'm like i'm like a [ __ ] rookie at 43. right so i'm like being talked like a little [ __ ] so it takes a lot for me you know i'm like yeah i've done some things man hang on now but i have to now humble myself again right it's hard to humble yourself you got some 21 year old little punk ass [ __ ] saying hey pick up that [ __ ] and come on i'm like what what the [ __ ] you say i'm like you know but i'm like okay god it's like you're rookie man like so that's all the training behind the mindset of it all right is that you can't ever be the point you never learn from people right you know you have to always humble yourself and go back to that yeah you know like right now there's people listening this podcast like oh yeah you're great guys no you ain't [ __ ] goggins and that's the mindset i always want to have not like i'm not proud of myself but you have to always keep that like i want to keep that dog in me and i can't always know everything yeah well being a beginner at something is fantastic it's amazing being learning new things is fantastic for everything else so much growth in that have you do you [ __ ] around with martial arts you know what i learned a little bit i've i've never gone crazy in it i've never gone crazy i boxed a little bit where do you live i live in nashville there's a lot of jiu jitsu in nashville you should get involved in jiu jitsu you would take like a duck to water i'll find you a spot yeah hook me up i'll find you a spot you would you get obsessed with that [ __ ] oh god is that so yeah that's a never-ending pile of [ __ ] tangled bodies and strangled people here we go because it's something that you just get better at all the time and there's no hiding right either you get choked or you don't either you survive or you don't now i've been on a lot of ground i've been a lot of ground games man but i've never really learned the skill sets yeah so it'd be nice to do that i'll hook it up yeah please do i think you would get obsessed with it the same way jack was obsessed with it same with a lot of other seals get obsessed with martial arts it would be nice to do it because it's also constant competition as well i mean you can get into competition every single night of the week really and yeah absolutely and as a a guy who's just starting out you're going to be a white belt you're going to get strangled a lot you want to choke the [ __ ] out from the beginning you're going to start from the beginning 100 there's plenty of guys your size there's plenty of guys that have been doing it for [ __ ] decades i know a lot of guys like to get their hands on me so i'll be good yeah oh goggins you're coming huh okay okay but it's also a good thing to have the kind of cardio and endurance you have too yeah that's where i get people so i've i've rolled with a lot of guys who have skills but the thing that i really have and i'm not gonna brag on it man is i got a [ __ ] up cardio bass man i got a [ __ ] up cardio bass man and my mentality is kind of [ __ ] up too yeah so i realized that we're fighting that if you get a big cardio base and your mindset's [ __ ] up too cardio is almost everything skills skills are everything because a lot of guys with skills also have some cardio they have enough to [ __ ] you up right but to have tremendous cardio with big skills is everything i see him out there man dying yeah because so many guys started 100 but three minutes into the fight they're at 80. right you know five minutes into the fight they're at 60. that's right and then they recover for a minute they come back but if you're if you are in like a rolling session like when you roll you roll for nine minutes straight so you and this guy and you there's most of the time there's multiple taps right you'll tap him he'll tap you you tap each other but nine minutes man it is exhausting when that bell goes off the last you know the the the bell for 30 seconds and you got 30 seconds left in nine minutes and then dinging it's over you're like you're done and then you take a minute off you find a new partner that's good [ __ ] get back in there you'd love it it sounds like a good grind yeah that's the next grind right there you love it yeah you blacked out hey so long that take about if i went like this hard at it it's hard to say because uh it depends entirely upon how much emphasis you put on learning new techniques and rolling and drilling drilling is gigantic and that's the thing that people don't like to do because jiu-jitsu is so fun people like to just roll right because it's sparring is where it's at like i don't want to do all those practice i want to choke people right like i knew a few things like do that okay and then i do this okay let me get in there now you want it's like a lot of uh jiu jitsu schools they'll start out with like one or two techniques and then you roll most of the class is just sparring right but the right way to do it really is to drill way more than you spar okay you should be drilling all the time and live drilling too like you start out where a guy has your back ready go and then from there you got to try to escape and do it the right thing to try to use the right technique to get out of that position or you'll start out uh with an arm bar but he's defending and you've got to figure out how to extend it you know and those live drills straight drills like technique drills and then live drills are i think even more important in the beginning to uh to to your personal development and growth as a jiu jitsu player than even sparring but a guy like you who's smart and tough and will go crazy [ __ ] it shouldn't take that long it takes people i mean it depends on how much you dedicate yourself to it right right b.j penn got his black belt in three years what yeah but it's crazy he's bj penn he's up like the prodigy for a reason right right i had a conversation with him about it though it was really interesting once he uh he goes uh he was talking to some other dude and the guy said uh i got my uh black belt at three years just like you did bj and he's like wow man he goes you must be good he goes no man he goes i'm addicted just like you he goes you were addicted you're addicted and he's like i never thought about it that way he goes yeah i'm addicted to jiu jitsu it's like you're addicted like it takes over your mind right it's everything your days are spent thinking about some guy who triangled you this [ __ ] how do you get me [ __ ] like i get that dude i got choked out ten years ago that i think about sometimes when i'm lifting i'll be tired and i'll think about a guy who caught me ten years i'm not like [ __ ] yeah just that's what's great about life man is i think about not being choked out by thinking about a lot of [ __ ] like that yeah little failures just keep you pushing they grind on me like a [ __ ] man and that's what you're talking about earlier too it's like the the the mind has these reserves you can trick it and pull them out yes these inspirational reserves like you did when when you when you guys were going through buds yes we just found that trigger and then all of a sudden you throw in that boat in the air the mind always has the tactical advantage over you why is that it knows your fears it knows your insecurities it knows where they're hiding you can't hide can't hide from that [ __ ] man that [ __ ] has a tactical advantage on you son that's gonna get you man it's a beast that might be your best lesson right that your mind your mind knows everything you cannot hide from it so don't ever try don't try you might as well go ahead and beat that [ __ ] gotta keep going at it that's also what you did in this book you didn't try to like paint yourself in a glamorous or flattering way at any point in time you were honest at every step of the way which i think is just gigantic for people too because you can tell when someone's stroking themselves or bullshitting themselves and the message just won't come through right but this you're you come through in this book you know like you who you are and what you became and how you became who you are and who you used to be and why you were the way you used to be all that comes through it's like there's no filter this is just your your thoughts like you what you remember about your life and what you think about right now just all comes out onto the pages hardest thing i've done my entire life i'm imagining i have [ __ ] i don't know how people buy this book then i walk up to people people walk up to me i'm like what are you thinking about [ __ ] hey thinking about me peeing in the bed you [ __ ] what are you thinking about oh that's hilarious i know right like you like are you thinking about me opening it up yeah you know all about me hey how about you [ __ ] tell me something about you that's what people love right when they know some [ __ ] about you you don't know nothing about them i don't know about nobody that's anonymous trolls that's it man and they get at me they come oh there's a lot of those but that they're all doing that to themselves they don't even understand when you do that you're doing it to yourself right if you are attacking someone because you know that they have a weakness but you're pretending you don't have one you are attacking yourself you are chipping away your own personal sovereignty chipping away at your own respect so true man can't respect yourself you know you're a [ __ ] but that's what happened though joe to me i started looking at people realizing i know something about you because they don't want to talk about it right i already know it yeah if you're talking [ __ ] about me yeah i know you're [ __ ] up yeah that's what all these cats that come out right now who don't like me whatever i'm like really man that [ __ ] happened 30 [ __ ] years ago 15 years ago you still you're still [ __ ] up about that oh man i know something about you brother see i get over everything i'm good it's it's water under the [ __ ] bridge it's a grind it's the the grind does that that's it you're not grinding harder if if you're worried about something that someone did to you years ago you're being a [ __ ] to yourself man not getting out there and squeezing that [ __ ] soul out every day yeah if you grind hard man i got time to worry about your monkey ass i i got to tell me about you man because tomorrow i gotta go back to the grind and tomorrow i go back to the grind again and again and again and again i don't have time to put you into the hate bank there's no hate it's all filtered out man through the grind people don't get it there's there's great joy in the grind the great jordan to suffer it totally cleanses your body out man of any kind of hate makes you grow up it's also the being honest about it every step of the way the way you are in this book and the way you are the way you talk about things you're not not trying to paint yourself in a flattering way no it it forces you to continue to perform right by exposing all the [ __ ] that you used to do by exposing your procrastination your your slips your f your fallings you're falling back down and getting fat again all that stuff it forces you to be consistent like you know you did it today you know you did it today do you know you're going to be able to do it tomorrow well you have to you have to know that you have to know and that's my biggest fear man is that i know i can slip everybody goes man you're not permanent [ __ ] no one's permanent almost [ __ ] permanent that's why people that have accomplished great things and then want to talk about those great things to the end of time and not do anything anymore no they're [ __ ] themselves that's it those people that are looking for that golden age they're looking for that holding hands and walking off into the sunset the credits roll that doesn't exist it's not tattooed man it's not real i thought it was tattoos i was like [ __ ] i'm slipping i'm like what i put all this repetition i'm still slipping can't take a day off man can't take a day off man no days can't take a day off seven days a week i i get after but see the thing about i do active recovery right okay so what's what's a light active recovery day you say seven days seven miles is normal an easy six mile run that's active recovery at a low low heart rate i look like i'm walking i'm out to like a [ __ ] 9 30 10 minute mile heart rates real low i'm really big into the heart rate training man it's amazing so it makes you a machine it makes you a machine man how so it won't work it trains your heart in a way that the way i was able to run these 100-mile races like i was able to do it was off a heart rate so if you go at 80 for me for the longest time it's like 100 like 147 heart rate 148 to 152 right around in there if i maintain that man i'm in that i'm burning that nice fat storage and that body wants to utilize that and it wants to burn that nice and slow and you're never getting that heart rate up or high you can get the heart rate for high it takes a lot to recover from that and the higher it goes the longer it takes for it to come down when i stayed at 145 146 147 heart rate for a long time when i get done running it will go back under 100 within two or three minutes and that's what you want you want that quick recovery so quick recovery means that your body's right on point and i look at my at my heart rate in the morning time it's using the 30s if it's like 45 46 47 i'm over trained easy day easy day means zone one zone one means i'm just going real light today so i train every day because why as a as my mind and as a human we're supposed to move every day i'm supposed to move and i'm not saying get after it every day get after me just do something every day right ride a bike like if you're real tired from working out hard ride an easy bike spin and as you're spinning take in your fluids rehydrate your body as you're acting because that's the best way to rehydrate your body and like taking a carbohydrate drink it gets all that good carbs you start to glycogen store your body again for the next day so as you're doing active stuff that blood's flowing nice active blood flow the nice active blood flow helps the recovery process along with drinking some some like endurance drink or some carbohydrate drink it gets all that glycogen through the system back to the muscles loads them back up again ready to fight another war tomorrow what do you use for a heart rate monitor i used to use polar for a long time um and i kind of still use polar now is it a wrist one or a chest it's a chest strap it's a nice cheap little chest strap and now i'm at a point now where i know i only do my heart rate in the morning time i don't even wear it when i run anymore do you check it with the strap in the morning or yeah your finger check the strap so you wake up you just put the strap on before you get out of bed put the strap on your body you don't first thing you do put a strap on or do your finger whatever one you can do you don't have a strap do your finger know what your average heart rate is you know your resting heart rate and then from there if it's a little bit high a little elevated you know you can't go off into that zone three zone four training day you gotta keep it at zone two or zone one so it's all about the heart rate the the resin heart rate so when you use it uh the chest trap does it register on an application on a phone like how do you read it on the watch on a watch is it a smart watch or is a polar watch it's a polar watch so it's a watch that shows you the heart rate that's reading off of the strap exactly that's all it does and so when you say zone ones this is these are the things that you've created zone ones onto the no these are like zones that um that's you know whoever created this like like the heart rate zone training so basically what i did in what's helped me out so much is my zone two training runs used to be 8 30. okay so that was my pace at like uh 140 mile yep 830 mile through stretching and getting my body opened up my zone two run now is about a seven twenty one seven eighteen seven nineteen so you cut a minute off just by opening up your range of motion up my range of motion wow unbelie at the same exact heart rate so my stride if people look at videos of me like years ago when i was first doing my first bad water look i was scooting i had like it was so tight i looked i was this this very rigid runner now i actually run you know everything was so tight everything was like kind of like forming in i was like kind of like like my knees and my joints just going inward and now everything's right you know where it needs to be at and i have a nice long nice stride do you run on the street are you the most part for the most part i'm always traveling so the best thing you do you got your running shoes you get your [ __ ] you just go out and run but i i try to hit the trails you know some dirt as much as possible yeah so this is really good for your body but now my body is like [ __ ] it's like [ __ ] like iron i mean it it it can take some beating now when you when you run have you ever [ __ ] with those uh barefoot running shoes or minimalism no no hell no hell no you know what like look honestly i don't know many people who have been i just don't believe in it i don't believe in it i've i was born with shoes wearing shoes my whole [ __ ] life i'm not you know i'm black but i'm not from africa you know so i'm not down man i'm not down dear ever read the science behind it yeah the idea of like using all the muscles on your feet yeah i read the science behind it i also read sometimes [ __ ] have broken feet and [ __ ] i read that too but minimalist shoes on trails aren't bad yeah they're not i'm not doing it no no no i will break my oh my god man i'm running those things all the time really so so you like them yeah i it would kill me but i tell you what i ran in uh fat tires yesterday under armour fat tire which is like a cushiony ass shoe you like it and i was like it was so easy it's like it's like those hocus whatever no no uh under armour has these fat tires it's basically like uh a bmx tire track i think it's even made by a tire company makes the tread yeah man it's like it's got a mush to it and you you're running these things man you could run over see the thing about those five finger barefoot shoes right i like running those but you got to look where you're stepping you can't step on any hard rocks game yeah over you'll [ __ ] up your foot yeah quick because it's like it's going to go right in your foot it's a tiny little thin so i went from those to vivos vivo barefoot shoes that's what it looks like so when you run on those [ __ ] that is a cushiony glorious padding like when you when you hit the ground it's like smooshy smooshy smush i had the other ones jamie the ones with the boa it's because it just like got that little click one that you just pulled up yeah like those so it's like you twist it with that that's how you tighten it up with that little boa uh adjuster thing it's like a got a thread through it so you don't have to lace it or anything like that you just slip them on and pop that sucker down i like to feel the ground a little bit when i run yeah you're barely feeling [ __ ] with those yeah that's clown yeah but i like it it's gotta be good for your joints my joints didn't bother me at all yesterday which is crazy like after a good solid run because most of what i'm running is hills right like pretty steep and it's great my ass and leg's never been what do you weigh right now 200 yeah you're thick dude man yeah so for me the pounding of the you know the the constant pounding with the feet to the ground it is uh it's it's rough on the ankles it's rough on you know the the joints but i don't feel it at all with those fat tires it was smooshy like i i got done running i felt like i cheated i did i felt like wow this is so much easier the cloud shoes yeah this just real cushioning and cam's always said that he runs with those a lot oh does he yeah he's run with a bunch of those like he's like because he runs so many [ __ ] miles he was running a marathon a day like pretty much every day i did that for a while bad bad bad i was sh my god i got wired in doing that [ __ ] man what is this right here so this is this is when i ran um i ran 150 mile trail race so the year before i did the same race it's 150 mile trail race i did it in i think around uh 40 hours and i had to walk the last 60 miles kind of i i had pneumonia here we go yeah and then i told the race director hey [ __ ] i'm coming back here next year and i'm breaking the course record i went back and then like 32 hours wow same race wow now no when you 33 hours so when you're running what what shoes do you use right now i'm wearing brooks and i also wear um asics so it just depends on you know what kind of train i'm in where i'm at stuff like that for trails what do you what run for trails i actually for the longest time i wore a street running shoe really for trails yeah for the longest time how come because first of all my body was so messed up the only shoe i could ever wear was this brooks addiction and i hate even giving brooks credit right now because back in the day they wouldn't help a brother out i was running so many miles yeah so brooks i'm not trying to i'm not promoting brooks right now yeah merry christmas on that one i caught him up a million times hey man can i get like a discount or some [ __ ] hang up nobody nothing so but they do have a good shoe and i uh and i and it was not good pr horrible pr man you know what i'm saying like you know so but um yeah i love their shoe the only thing i could wear was that brook's addiction because my my bio mechanics was so messed up i tried so many different shoes and and that was a so i can now wear a neutral shoe so how i used to run and very few people know this i used to have heel wedges inserts heel wedges and get compression tape because my body was pushed so far in from being so tight in my hip flexors that so how i got such bad stress fractures was my bio mechanical there's a picture of my toe in there because my my toes just jammed in front of my shoes because my whole body just got this like bent in so you when you're saying bent in for people just listening you're if your hands are flat on a table you're turning the outside of your hands in up so that your thumbs are going down those are my so yeah so that's those big toes right going down or going down and into the shoe and the outside of your foot was up was above it right so what i had to do to run because i was like god i got stress fractures all the time and my feet were so [ __ ] up sometimes you see that with people's shoes like how they're worn out worn out worn out on the sideways example like a wedge right can you look at it from behind this crazy yeah that was my shoe so i had to get a heel wedge to keep my heel from going down got severe tendonitis in the back of my ankle actually you had to make it thicker on one side that's right just to force on the inside flat right so the inside i had to push up and i had to get compression tape so it was compression tape heel wedges and an insert and that's how i ran every [ __ ] day did you go to a running coach or anything did you i don't know but didn't you want to know what you were doing wrong you know what man that was part of that garanimal mindset man [ __ ] it man i'm supposed to be broken you know but then i got smarter as time went and said oh man this is some painful [ __ ] running 100 mile races with this kind of tendinitis and my feet being [ __ ] up it was so painful so i was like you know what so then after i started stretching i was like my god all this was from having a tight i got so massive my god i was i was in all these different contraptions and now i just wear normal running shoes wow yeah so i went from being contraptioned up man like literally contraption up so it's all just the stretching that opened up the range of motion now when people talk about range of motion they don't understand how tight i was like no one understands like when you repeatedly do what i was doing to myself and you were born with the stress i was born under like i hate i can't paint a clear it's it's pretty clear in the book man my life was bad the stress i endured on a daily i had two people and my body was proof of literally what my life was doing to me it literally was knotted all my muscles up because i was always under this fight or flight you know my my dad had made me so [ __ ] scared of [ __ ] you know to to unwind this [ __ ] man was like it was it was it was a hard task you know i it was a hard it was a hard task man so it's a lot of times it's not just all the hard training no but it's also the mind the mind because think about it man when you're under stress that hip flexor that that psoas muscle which is attached to your t12 that that's the only muscle that attaches your lower body to your upper body and that's the muscle that's that's your fight or flight whenever you get nervous or scared or something like that that [ __ ] was tightened up i mean i mean your whole body is i lived in that like almost fetal position in my mind for so many years so i was always on this like tight-knit tension [ __ ] guy but i walked around like i'm some cool here's my new hairstyle pants are sagging i'm a cool dude man right but that was another costume the costume wore every day yeah got tired of running that [ __ ] man next costume i want you to be in is a jiu jitsu guy with a white belt on i'm going to send you a picture man i got it i know you're listening to the picture i know you're gonna cause i already planted that oh my god i know it's bouncing around yeah it is it is i'm gonna set it up nashville i know there's some places out there nashville holler at me oh trust me i'm sure they will we'll find you a spot we'll have a funny spot um listen man this book is [ __ ] fantastic i'm halfway in i can't wait to finish it and uh just thank you thank you for the inspiration thank you for being so honest and expressing yourself i appreciate the [ __ ] out joe appreciate you brother
