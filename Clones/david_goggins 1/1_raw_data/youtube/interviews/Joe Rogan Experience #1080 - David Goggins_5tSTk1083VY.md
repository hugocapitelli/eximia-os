[01:29] don't understand is they don't
[01:30] understand the journey that it took me
[01:32] to get to this point and what got me to
[01:35] this point was I was just the opposite
[01:37] everything the day I was that guy who
[01:40] ran away from absolutely everything that
[01:43] I got in front of me but not many people
[01:45] knew that I had two people at the like
[01:49] the real me was like this very scared
[01:51] insecure stuttering got beat up by his
[01:54] dad all this kind of stuff and I built
[01:57] this fake person that walked around like
[01:59] my [ __ ] didn't stink you know you know
[02:02] that yeah so that was that's kind of how
[02:04] I did it and I do the process of time I
[02:07] realized that I was lying to myself and
[02:09] lying to people but that it's a
[02:11] fascinating journey though because
[02:13] you are that guy now Ryan you genuinely
[02:16] are legit badass right at one point in
[02:18] time you were a legit terrified person
[02:22] yes so what was the process like how did
[02:24] how did you step forth well it's a it's
[02:27] a long process right um I my dad beat
[02:32] the [ __ ] I mean was growing up we I was
[02:34] the first black baby born in this
[02:36] hospital called Millard Fillmore in
[02:38] Buffalo New York my dad owned skating
[02:41] rinks he owned bars he ran prostitutes
[02:43] from Canada to Buffalo New York my dad
[02:46] was a big-time pimp big-time anything
[02:48] bad about a person
[02:49] big-time hustler he was American you
[02:52] know that I'm with them Denzel
[02:53] Washington he was that but not that bad
[02:55] right yeah he wasn't that big but that's
[02:58] what it reminds me of he was that kind
[03:00] of guy and beat the [ __ ] out of me did
[03:03] she help you no I love my mom there was
[03:05] an instant one time when my mom got
[03:06] knocked out on top of stairs and they
[03:08] drug her down the stairs by her hair at
[03:10] six years old
[03:11] I'll never forget this in my mind I was
[03:15] always afraid my whole life I was afraid
[03:17] but I had this [ __ ] voice this this
[03:19] conscience that would always be battling
[03:22] me said hey you got to get up and do
[03:23] something I didn't want to do [ __ ] you
[03:26] know I was just afraid but I would that
[03:29] that voice would forced me to get up and
[03:30] my dad you know I try to beat him up
[03:32] whatever at six and I get my ass kicked
[03:33] so this went on for several years and I
[03:36] have a big time learning disability can
[03:38] my dad didn't believe in us going to
[03:39] school so my dad it was about the
[03:42] business the skating rink in the bar so
[03:45] this game you open about seven o'clock
[03:46] at night and this is when time I was
[03:48] able to walk so about five you know four
[03:51] or five six years old eight nine and I
[03:54] go to the skating rink it's ten o'clock
[03:55] at night and I worked the skating rink
[03:57] until 10:00 at night and then we would
[04:00] scrape the gum off the floors and we
[04:01] cleaned the whole skating rink up and
[04:03] then my dad at the office and my brother
[04:05] and myself asleep in the office and my
[04:07] mama go upstairs and worked the bar
[04:09] until three o'clock in the morning and
[04:11] then they cleaned the bar up so after
[04:14] all that [ __ ] was done with going to
[04:15] school really happened so when I went to
[04:18] school I was all kind of you know my
[04:20] learning disability I had social anxiety
[04:23] I was just a jacked up kid from living
[04:25] in this tour
[04:26] at home from the outside looking in we
[04:29] live in the all-white neighborhood and
[04:30] then we would travel to the ghetto of
[04:33] Buffalo New York with the skating rink
[04:34] was that so we you know we worked around
[04:37] mostly blacks and I lived around mostly
[04:39] White's but no one knew what was going
[04:41] on the house that on 201 Paradise Road
[04:44] yeah it's crazy but um my mom got
[04:47] courage to finally leave him when I was
[04:49] by 8 years old we moved to a small town
[04:51] in Brazil Indiana and that's when the
[04:54] real war started for me and Brazilian is
[04:56] a small town great people a lot of great
[04:58] people and I say that because like
[05:00] people get offended and I'm gonna get to
[05:03] the point where they get offended there
[05:05] was about maybe 10 black families at
[05:07] about 10,000 people in the town and in
[05:10] 1995 the KKK marched in the 4th of July
[05:13] parade so this was a not every bar was
[05:16] racist there's a lot of good people some
[05:18] the best people I knew was there but
[05:19] there's also a lot of racism there so me
[05:21] being one of the few black kids net you
[05:24] know in the area you know it kind of
[05:26] haunts you I had stuff on my notebook
[05:27] you know [ __ ] we're gonna kill you on
[05:29] my Spanish notebook they had that on my
[05:32] car [ __ ] this is early 90s and so even
[05:36] though I sold it didn't hurt me
[05:38] it was jacking me up so all the
[05:40] insecurities I have when I was a kid
[05:41] with my father I moved into this area
[05:44] here and it just got worse and worse and
[05:47] worse and it [ __ ] haunted me and that
[05:50] voice that talked about it kept talking
[05:52] louder and louder and louder I was doing
[05:54] nothing about it and I decided to make
[05:57] moves and I cheated all through school
[06:00] and it's kind of humbling to talk with
[06:03] my stories sometimes in this um it's
[06:05] also embarrassing but it's real it's who
[06:08] the [ __ ] I am is what I am is what
[06:10] created me and copy from the fourth
[06:13] grade to the to my junior year in high
[06:15] school on every assignment and I want to
[06:19] get in the military I'm gonna join the
[06:20] airforce and the guy gave me an as vapp
[06:23] test as I could water down SAT and I
[06:25] couldn't copy on it because the guy
[06:27] beside me how to test a test B they got
[06:29] him I write he had test C so I looked
[06:31] the copy on this test and I couldn't
[06:32] copy on so I got like a 20 and I wanted
[06:35] to be an Air Force pararescueman it's
[06:37] guys that jump out of airplanes and save
[06:38] down pilots it's a
[06:39] it's a special operator in the Air Force
[06:41] and my squirt was so horribly low that
[06:44] is we take it again
[06:45] and he said hey I got an 18 the second
[06:49] time even worse I need to get a 50 out
[06:51] of a 99 and so a mom and I for a while
[06:55] we lived in the government subsidized
[06:56] apartments seven dollars a month and
[06:58] also food stamps and we slowly moved up
[07:01] to a $230 a month place but at the time
[07:04] you know we you know pretty poor but um
[07:06] my mom afforded enough money for me to
[07:09] go to see a tutor one one hour a week so
[07:13] for four hours a month it had six months
[07:15] to study from our last test I can only
[07:16] take the best you know the answer to
[07:18] test three times and I studied my ass
[07:22] off and passed it I got in the Air Force
[07:24] and realized there was more things in
[07:25] front of me I was afraid of water
[07:27] terrified the water and I've learned how
[07:30] to swim but what gets everybody in this
[07:33] training in all special ops training is
[07:35] the water confidence where they try to
[07:36] pretty much drowned your ass you know
[07:38] all of our lives we've been breathing
[07:40] and they take that from you and they
[07:43] want to see how comfortable you are in
[07:44] the water and there's a 1%
[07:46] african-americans in Special Operations
[07:48] and I didn't know anything about African
[07:50] like a lot of them are negative buoyant
[07:52] which I am because the bone density I
[07:54] struggled but I'm six weeks into the
[07:57] program there was about 25 guys left of
[07:59] about 150 I was there and I was never I
[08:03] didn't gonna sleep for six weeks of the
[08:04] program and I wanted to quit so badly
[08:08] but I quit everything in my life I
[08:09] copied through school I want to prove
[08:11] people wrong and so here I am in this
[08:14] Air Force program start to get a little
[08:16] more confidence but this water was
[08:17] kicking my ass
[08:18] and six weeks in the program the doctor
[08:21] gave me a blood test and must have
[08:23] sickle-cell sickle cell trait not the
[08:25] anemia but I still killed people but so
[08:28] they pulled me out training for a week
[08:29] and when you go from being very
[08:31] uncomfortable in that water situation
[08:33] and then now you're comfortable and I'm
[08:35] sitting back watching the guys drown I'm
[08:37] not you know I'm not part of the
[08:38] activities anymore for this week I don't
[08:41] want to get back in that damn water
[08:42] again so the fear overcame in all my
[08:45] insecurities for my dad from this small
[08:47] town from everything started coming back
[08:48] and even though no one knew how [ __ ]
[08:51] up I was kind of create this other
[08:52] person
[08:53] tough I live with this [ __ ] all time so
[08:56] mean I wouldn't go back in that water
[08:58] the doctor called me a backup I thought
[09:00] to get like a like a medical kick out of
[09:02] the military so no quitting for me they
[09:04] kicked me out so I can have some pride
[09:06] the doctor said no I'm kidding you know
[09:08] we could put you back in the training
[09:09] and I was like [ __ ] but after a week I'm
[09:13] like you know what I missed one week
[09:14] there's only three weeks left there's a
[09:16] good chance you know I could tough this
[09:18] [ __ ] out and go on but I went back to
[09:20] the CEO and the commanding officer of
[09:22] the program and the sergeant said hey
[09:25] you gotta start from day one because you
[09:27] missed you know that that week of
[09:29] training and I broke
[09:30] I broke I couldn't imagine going back
[09:34] through that again
[09:35] so I made up a lie and I said man
[09:38] there's sickle-cell things really
[09:39] scaring me it was the [ __ ] water it
[09:41] wasn't sickle cell and and I pretty much
[09:44] quit even though they gave me a medical
[09:45] and I quit so um from the age of 19 days
[09:51] of 22 I went into the job called tack
[09:54] pee where you control fast movers behind
[09:56] enemy lines cool job but there's no
[09:58] water I was afraid of water so I've
[10:00] avoided it and I gained 125 pounds in
[10:04] that time frame
[10:04] I went from 175 to almost 300 to 297 was
[10:08] my heaviest and I started finding things
[10:10] that was comfortable and the more things
[10:12] I found comfortable the more
[10:14] uncomfortable my mind was because that
[10:16] voice I was telling you about it always
[10:18] was there I was trying to avoid that
[10:20] conscience I wanted to be left alone
[10:23] from that conscience and it wouldn't
[10:25] leave me alone so I got out of the Air
[10:27] Force and I started working for a job
[10:29] called ecolab respray for cockroaches at
[10:32] 24 and I'm spraying at different staking
[10:36] sheiks Red Lobster whatever from 11
[10:38] o'clock at night at 7 o'clock in the
[10:39] morning and what changed I came home and
[10:42] watch this Discovery Channel show class
[10:44] 224 I came home from Steak N Shake I
[10:47] sprayed it down last get a big ol large
[10:49] 42 ounce shake walk across the street
[10:51] and get a box of mini doughnuts from
[10:53] 7-eleven you never drive home for 45
[10:57] minutes this big old fat guy who yeah I
[11:00] worked out but I was fat I didn't run
[11:03] didn't PT I just hit the gym so I'm
[11:06] driving
[11:06] home turn the TV on and what comes on
[11:09] Discovery Channel so and that's what
[11:11] everything changed for me I was taking a
[11:13] shower I walked out heard these guys and
[11:15] I watched the show and it made me
[11:18] reflect big-time on the piece of [ __ ]
[11:20] that I am and I'm exactly what people
[11:22] said I was going to be so so what was on
[11:25] this show that really struck home it was
[11:27] um I saw these guys going into water so
[11:30] I was terrified of it I can't even
[11:32] express have you ever had a big fear and
[11:34] I know a lot of fighters have fears and
[11:36] stuff like that but they get over them
[11:38] but all of us have these fears that you
[11:40] just don't want to [ __ ] face and um I
[11:43] have a lot of them had a lot of them and
[11:45] that's what created the person who's in
[11:47] front of today and we'll get into that
[11:49] but I'm just a scared [ __ ] is what I
[11:52] was and but I was watching these guys
[11:55] going through hell week class 2:24 and
[11:57] these guys ringing the bell quitting
[11:59] dropping their helmet down rolling out a
[12:01] lot of guys is leaving and it made me
[12:04] reflect on my fears my insecurities and
[12:08] I saw real men when I thought were real
[12:10] men who were staying who were overcoming
[12:13] adversity who were overcoming all these
[12:15] different things that I had blamed so
[12:17] many [ __ ] people in my life my dad my
[12:21] mom for not being there when I was 14
[12:23] years old my my mama's would get
[12:25] remarried to this great guy he got
[12:26] murdered and then I moved back to a
[12:29] small town in Brazil and and I everybody
[12:32] was a blame my learned disability my my
[12:35] skin color you know me being everything
[12:38] and so I sat there for a while and I was
[12:40] like man I gotta [ __ ] I got it
[12:43] no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me
[12:44] no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me
[12:46] his [ __ ] me against me period and I'm
[12:49] so I had to man up and I said first
[12:52] thing I started doing is facing every
[12:53] [ __ ] fear I have no matter what the
[12:55] [ __ ] it is man and these things would
[12:58] keep me up and that no one people who
[13:00] are here in this [ __ ] day they will
[13:01] never really understand and grasp when
[13:04] you face these things and so many things
[13:06] how they keep you up and haunts you at
[13:08] night I think there's a lot of people
[13:09] out there that know what you're talking
[13:10] about I mean and so that's what it did
[13:13] and I had two options to either be that
[13:18] 300-pound guy who spray for cockroaches
[13:20] and
[13:20] thousand dollars a month and at 24 years
[13:24] old knowing we're not 50 [ __ ] years
[13:26] old I can reflect on this and think
[13:27] about what God never became or I can
[13:30] totally just sack it up and fail and
[13:33] fail and fail entire succeed so I
[13:36] started calling recruiters up I said
[13:38] we'll be a [ __ ] Navy SEAL and every
[13:41] recruiter so there's a weight and height
[13:42] so they weigh weight and height limit to
[13:45] get in the military and I was 6 foot 1
[13:47] and to 97 and I had prior service which
[13:50] was a big deal so I called all these
[13:52] recruiters up and all of them said hey
[13:54] how tall are you bla bla they got into
[13:55] conversation and see if I even qualified
[13:57] and by the time I got to my weight phone
[14:00] we were hanging up pretty much like hey
[14:02] you know what call somebody else you
[14:03] know try to get in the reserves so I
[14:05] tried to get in the reserves and I
[14:07] called this guy named Steven salad your
[14:08] recruiter up and he said hey come on in
[14:10] he saw me put me through the weight
[14:12] standard all the sort of stuff and to
[14:14] get into the class I had to get into how
[14:16] to lose 106 pounds in less than 3 months
[14:18] so I was like [ __ ] that I can't do that
[14:22] I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and
[14:23] went back to Ecolab I'm going back to
[14:25] work man this is my life
[14:27] so in this job you look you know you're
[14:30] looking for cockroach she's looking for
[14:31] rodents and stuff like that and this
[14:33] next morning or this next night I went
[14:35] to work and I hit the all-night
[14:38] cockroaches too much I hit the mother
[14:40] lode of cockroaches and this restaurant
[14:44] got full of cockroaches and rodents and
[14:46] everything else and I sat there and said
[14:48] this is my life I said this is my life
[14:50] you are exactly who the [ __ ] that this
[14:53] is it and I said this ain't gonna be it
[14:56] for me so in that restaurant I quit my
[15:00] job left my canister in that restaurant
[15:02] my spray canister got back in my ecolab
[15:05] truck and I went home and I started
[15:07] working out like somebody I was I became
[15:10] the most obsessed person on the planet
[15:12] Earth that was basically I had to invent
[15:18] a guy that didn't exist I had to invent
[15:21] a guy that can take any pain any
[15:22] suffering any kind of judgment be called
[15:25] [ __ ] be called whatever the [ __ ] in
[15:27] the world and be understanding the
[15:28] [ __ ] room and said go [ __ ] yourself I
[15:29] had it built the I had to build this
[15:31] callous mind and I built it to suffering
[15:34] I built it to downright [ __ ] just
[15:36] crushing myself if it was raining
[15:38] outside three o'clock in the [ __ ]
[15:39] morning feeling the first instinct is
[15:42] don't go out there and do [ __ ] my
[15:44] instinct was we gotta [ __ ] go out
[15:46] there anything that was [ __ ] horrible
[15:49] in my life that I would normally say no
[15:52] that was inhumane that most people I had
[15:55] to go do it and I started callous in my
[15:58] mind at this point in my life and I lost
[16:01] the weight I lost the weight and I went
[16:04] back to recruiter I got into that class
[16:05] and I went through three Navy sohail
[16:09] weeks in one year only God ever be in
[16:11] three hell weeks in one year after my
[16:13] knowledge the first one I didn't make it
[16:15] through the next two I did and that I
[16:18] just didn't stop anymore from there
[16:22] and I started realizing through this
[16:24] through this process that the [ __ ]
[16:28] mind is what you created and I started
[16:30] opening different doors that I didn't
[16:32] think we're even there they didn't think
[16:33] even existed and the more doors are
[16:35] opening up the more I start realizing
[16:37] that my potential is damn near endless
[16:39] and it changed my whole mindset so I
[16:43] went from David Goggins and I created
[16:45] Goggins and that journey is a priceless
[16:49] journey that is hard for me to explain
[16:51] to people because it sounds so quick and
[16:52] easy that guy's lost this weight and I
[16:54] went through three healthiest I went to
[16:56] Ranger school went to Delta Force Lexus
[16:57] whatever it is it was brutal it's a
[17:01] brutal journey every [ __ ] day and if
[17:03] ever less what are you happy
[17:04] if anybody knows my life story and I try
[17:07] to give you a just a snippet of it where
[17:09] I'm at two days in front of Joe Rogan
[17:11] telling you my life to get through what
[17:13] I became to get to where I'm at now
[17:16] there's nothing but pride I have for
[17:18] myself that I can't really I can't
[17:20] really show people because I have this
[17:22] face and a space that they see like are
[17:24] you happy what's wrong with you I'm
[17:26] driven I'm obsessed and that's what you
[17:29] see that's it people need to hear this
[17:32] story
[17:33] this is a this is an exciting story for
[17:35] people because there's a lot of people
[17:36] out there that feel trapped and they
[17:37] feel stuck and they feel like they can't
[17:39] do anything this is who they are you're
[17:41] a guy who felt that exact same way but
[17:44] figured out how to not be that person
[17:47] and be a person
[17:48] you would admire how did you what were
[17:50] the first steps like you had some slips
[17:53] before right because you you quit
[17:55] because of the water thing right but
[17:56] then when you went back the second time
[17:58] and you decide you're going to lose all
[17:59] that weight and you quit that job did
[18:01] did you was it just straight forward
[18:03] from there or whether there's some days
[18:05] where you just failed and then you
[18:07] picked it back up again so my first run
[18:09] when I decided to lose the weight I was
[18:11] like I said 297 I was about thirty two
[18:14] percent body fat and I went my idea was
[18:17] to run four miles for my first run I
[18:20] didn't know how bad it's gonna [ __ ]
[18:22] hurt me I used to run before I was fat
[18:23] and I was like [ __ ] it I can do this I
[18:25] ran a quarter mile and walked home I
[18:27] walked home and sat on my couch and
[18:29] cried I miss my mom's house who was
[18:31] about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the
[18:34] road and cried and getting her couch
[18:36] saying I can't [ __ ] do this I don't
[18:37] know what I'm gonna do I just got
[18:40] somebody pregnant my life was this
[18:43] [ __ ] I was making $1,000 a month my
[18:45] rent was 8/10 a month and my mind just
[18:47] kept [ __ ] with me and kept [ __ ]
[18:49] you're not good enough man this isn't
[18:51] for you man these guys are best mother
[18:52] [ __ ] on the planet Earth you not that
[18:54] and what it was and it's kind of funny I
[18:59] was obsessed with rocky rocky one in
[19:04] particular and when I was a kid I come
[19:07] home every day and I watched his [ __ ]
[19:08] show rocky and I was fast forward with
[19:11] the little VHS tapes to round 14 round
[19:15] 14 [ __ ] me up like nobody's business
[19:18] why this song came on right so when I
[19:21] bought the pull-up record I listened to
[19:22] the song for 17 hours it's two minutes
[19:23] and 13 seconds and I'm able to visualize
[19:28] and dream like nobody's business and I
[19:33] know that I can create a vision that
[19:35] many people can't and I work for it so
[19:38] the vision I had was when Apollo Creed
[19:40] beat the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of Rocky beat
[19:42] the [ __ ] out of him he's kept fighting
[19:44] he was a dumb fighter couldn't read
[19:47] couldn't [ __ ] on me couldn't read
[19:49] couldn't write just punchy everything
[19:52] about him and rocky beaches are probably
[19:55] [ __ ] using that corner everybody was
[19:56] saying stay the [ __ ] down
[19:58] and him getting up him getting up Apollo
[20:02] Creed raised his arms up in the [ __ ]
[20:04] air turn around thought he won the fight
[20:05] he turns around and sees this guy
[20:07] getting up and it was the face of Apollo
[20:10] Creed that changed my life the face of
[20:13] Apollo Creed it was like just by that
[20:15] [ __ ] getting up not winning just
[20:18] by him getting the [ __ ] up Apollo Creed
[20:21] was his champ his best rocky had taken
[20:24] his soul had literally taken his soul
[20:28] his his head goes down he looks down
[20:29] like Ruth what the [ __ ] are you
[20:31] I wanted to be that not Rocky I want to
[20:35] be the guy that people looked at I don't
[20:37] keep you've liked me or didn't like I
[20:38] don't care but said this [ __ ] is
[20:40] gonna keep coming after whatever the
[20:44] [ __ ] is in front of them I wanted that I
[20:46] wanted that I wanted that worse than
[20:49] anything in the world
[20:50] so that is I kept picturing me falling
[20:56] down and getting up and every
[20:57] [ __ ] that called me [ __ ] I was
[20:59] dumped even myself even myself I wanted
[21:03] to feel something besides two feet I
[21:05] wanted to just go to distance and that
[21:09] going a distance pushed me to a point of
[21:11] where now I go way past the distance so
[21:15] you go the first day you run a
[21:17] quarter-mile and you walk back home and
[21:19] you're you're upset how do you how do
[21:21] you move forward so basically idea was I
[21:23] came home and I had a talking milkshake
[21:26] I sat down and I gave up I said it
[21:29] saying go [ __ ] happen Mac I lose 106
[21:31] pounds and I came and go a quarter a
[21:32] [ __ ] mile I started being able to
[21:38] take negative [ __ ] and be happy and this
[21:43] whole I say what if a lot it sounds
[21:45] corny and it sounds weak but it's true
[21:48] one of the recruiters said there's not
[21:51] many black Navy SEALs in fact I was a
[21:52] thirty six african-american seal in
[21:54] history
[21:55] is in overseas because the [ __ ] water
[21:58] you know I mean people get mad at me
[22:00] it's [ __ ] true just get over it and
[22:02] so I was like man what story would it be
[22:08] if my [ __ ] fat dumb lying to be
[22:12] people insecure ass can overcome this
[22:16] [ __ ] and that would if mentality like
[22:18] that that dreamer mentality just would
[22:22] always fuel me it was just ruin man what
[22:24] if I can be but if I can be a seal man
[22:26] what if I can go from wearing a quarter
[22:29] of [ __ ] mile now I run 205 miles what
[22:33] if I can go but just what if I can go in
[22:35] and what if how would that feel if I'm
[22:38] graduating kind of get at that
[22:39] graduation thing I was talking about
[22:40] 224th like the video I said then I'll
[22:42] watch this command officer stood up and
[22:45] he said to the graduation guys you're
[22:47] graduating buds like eighteen of them he
[22:50] said we live in a society where
[22:51] mediocrities often rewarded and we don't
[22:53] to say something about these men detest
[22:55] mediocrity and I wanted to be a man that
[22:59] the test mediocrity you know it got me a
[23:02] lot of trouble in the SEAL Teams and
[23:04] going forward in my life because I just
[23:06] I started looking down on people for not
[23:08] going hardest [ __ ] [ __ ] and I started
[23:11] to create different things but that's
[23:13] for a different day but I just believe
[23:15] that it you know my whole mind changed
[23:17] that is a problem that a lot of people
[23:19] who work hard to have you get angry at
[23:21] people who don't work hard to the point
[23:23] where you you know you want to insult
[23:25] them you want to you want to smack them
[23:27] and it's really because you're scared of
[23:29] seeing that yourself yeah that's
[23:31] probably the truth that's probably the
[23:33] truth so I guess a lot of times my life
[23:36] I would see people and it part was a
[23:38] direct reflection of who I was and I
[23:40] would get mad at them but reflections
[23:42] probably just be getting mad at myself
[23:43] yeah that's for me 100% when I when I
[23:46] see people they're half-ass some things
[23:47] I get terrified of seeing that in myself
[23:49] and I get mad at them right and it's uh
[23:52] it's not a good way to handle it no you
[23:55] know but it's it's natural because
[23:56] you're just terrified of seeing that
[23:58] trait right and it cost me so you come
[24:01] back mmm you do the quarter-mile right
[24:03] you walk back home how do you regroup so
[24:06] what I did I sat down then I put rocky
[24:08] in I got my milkshake put rocky ice you
[24:11] know what I was big-time in Rocky and
[24:13] platoon why platoon I love to see people
[24:16] who were getting beat down and this
[24:19] there's there's scenes there's scenes
[24:22] that this drove me and people in my hell
[24:24] weeks you know I was in three of them
[24:25] always hear me singing these songs these
[24:28] songs humming these songs in torturous
[24:30] situations when you're when everybody's
[24:32] quitting this [ __ ] code I would be
[24:34] somewhere gone somewhere [ __ ] gone if
[24:38] somewhere [ __ ] darkest [ __ ] there's a
[24:40] scene of platoon when Elias Wimborne and
[24:42] shoots Elias and you know they think
[24:44] Elias is dead and the choppers are
[24:47] taking off and charlie sheen's ask him
[24:50] you know Tom Berenger
[24:51] where's Elias reason lies Willem Dafoe I
[24:54] found him back there dead somewhere and
[24:57] through the woods the Viet Cong has
[25:00] chasing he lies through the woods and
[25:01] the shoot him in his [ __ ] back
[25:02] and all he wants to do is get to the
[25:04] [ __ ] chopper he's getting shot in his
[25:05] back he's getting up getting something
[25:06] face getting up and you see this guy
[25:08] just fighting
[25:09] I love the [ __ ] guy who just [ __ ]
[25:12] fights and so I put these things in as
[25:14] reminders that you're gonna have to
[25:17] [ __ ] suffer man this [ __ ] point
[25:20] two-five man this is man you're gonna
[25:22] have to [ __ ] suffer to go from this
[25:26] fat insecure [ __ ] to one of the
[25:29] best guys on the planet Earth this
[25:31] journeys could take something that is
[25:33] going to be incomprehensible to most
[25:34] people and these different
[25:37] visualizations how I visualized myself
[25:40] talked it became so nasty and dirty that
[25:43] I wasn't liked the fact that I went
[25:46] point to five so it became from being
[25:48] defeated to like man all right
[25:51] [ __ ] maybe you know maybe
[25:52] tomorrow and go point seven-five you
[25:54] know it just became this different
[25:56] mindset I turn negatives into positives
[25:57] so I would I would take it like who
[26:00] would even think about doing this so I
[26:02] would sit in my couch saying who at 297
[26:04] who can't [ __ ] swim that great who
[26:06] scary the [ __ ] water we have the
[26:08] [ __ ] balls kind of balls to [ __ ]
[26:11] man up quit a job and go and it put
[26:14] everything on himself
[26:15] so it's how I started talking to myself
[26:18] and put myself in a whole different
[26:20] category and that was fueling me the
[26:21] next day and I just kept using that as
[26:23] fuel and fuel no one would do this [ __ ]
[26:25] no one do this [ __ ] you're the best
[26:27] [ __ ] around you're the best
[26:28] [ __ ] ever live and I had the
[26:30] guys kept fueling me with them with the
[26:32] right kind of message that I needed to
[26:34] hear that was never telling myself and
[26:36] through time
[26:39] became reality to myself so you start
[26:43] out on the first day and then do you
[26:45] start running again the second day yeah
[26:47] the second day was right back after
[26:48] again but I start realizing I can't run
[26:50] that for right so what I did was I
[26:52] became damn near a professional cyclist
[26:54] with the miles I put it on the bike so I
[26:57] never we never watched TV
[26:59] I had to be doing something so I was
[27:01] riding the bike I rode a bike a lot to
[27:04] lose the first initial kind of weight
[27:06] cuz it took my bones were just hurting
[27:08] so bad my bow is broken and I learned to
[27:10] get over that also and I tried to swim a
[27:12] lot I weren't a great swimmer but
[27:13] putting fins on kind of equalized my
[27:15] body I wasn't so negative buoyant so I
[27:17] started fitting a whole bunch and I
[27:19] spent hours in the pool hours in the
[27:21] pool trying to get more and more
[27:23] comfortable not because I was going
[27:24] underwater I was so scared of the water
[27:26] that I had to live in the water I had to
[27:29] become one with the water so going to
[27:32] the pool used to scare me so I went to
[27:34] the pool an awful awful lot and then the
[27:38] bike got easier I was able to run more I
[27:41] went from like one mile one mile was a
[27:44] great accomplishment two miles and then
[27:46] from 2 to 3 was a big one I went from 3
[27:48] to 6 and then like they have a warning
[27:51] order that they give people to get ready
[27:53] for buts and the whole thing was running
[27:55] 6 miles five days a week and that was my
[27:58] goal and so I just kept I failed I go
[28:01] back to scratch I use some positive
[28:03] motivation I have like one day where I
[28:05] like [ __ ] defeated but I started
[28:07] realizing this a part of the process
[28:09] this is a part of the journey I had to
[28:10] realize this is part of my process
[28:11] versus just saying like I used to
[28:14] I'm just not good enough if I'm not good
[28:16] enough we always say that [ __ ] that's
[28:18] not good enough and then we try
[28:19] something else
[28:19] I'm gonna [ __ ] make myself good
[28:21] enough and that became my mentality I'm
[28:23] gonna make myself good enough and so I
[28:26] misunderstood a lot but that's that's
[28:29] all it came down to I made myself good
[28:31] enough and the days I couldn't run that
[28:34] far the next week I would do two a days
[28:37] so on the running if I ran a
[28:40] quarter-mile I weighed a [ __ ] couple
[28:43] hours it haunt me bother me I try to run
[28:45] a half a mile next time same day you can
[28:48] do more than this if I had to walk ahead
[28:50] and walk it just became just a process
[28:52] of
[28:53] grinding and grinding and grandees not
[28:55] even a good word for it it's not even a
[28:57] good word for it and just just going
[29:00] further and further and then when I got
[29:01] through running I go to the bike I go to
[29:03] the pool if I got tired somewhere my
[29:06] legs are tired
[29:06] I go to the gym and I develop this crazy
[29:09] workout where I was doing volume like
[29:12] two-three hundred reps of like very
[29:15] lightweight people I said how you know
[29:17] how come you have any like loose skin my
[29:19] workout routine the gym became sick it
[29:22] became sick I was just doing two three
[29:23] hundred reps four hundred reps on like
[29:25] chest just like for one simple exercise
[29:28] the best press and a racket get back on
[29:32] it just rep it out trying to burn as
[29:34] many calories I can't build that muscle
[29:35] mass and ice became just became obsessed
[29:38] with it so when you're doing this are
[29:40] you worried at all about repetitive
[29:42] stress injuries or the fact that your
[29:44] body's not conditioned for this and
[29:45] you're basically taking your body where
[29:47] you had abused it right and now you're
[29:49] you're forcing it to live like in an
[29:51] elite athlete right I didn't care I
[29:53] didn't know any better I didn't think
[29:55] about it wow I didn't I didn't know that
[29:58] working out that hard would [ __ ] you up
[30:00] I did it [ __ ] you up oh yeah yeah that's
[30:02] one reason I'm with you three Hill weeks
[30:04] so I don't talk about a lot but um the
[30:08] stress of my life getting to 24 calls me
[30:11] have some serious so as issues I know
[30:13] anything about this [ __ ] there's so as
[30:15] muscles what we use history hip flexor
[30:16] muscle and basically under stress it
[30:19] starts to tighten up and I was I started
[30:22] for from the time I was in third grade
[30:24] time I was in seventh grade white
[30:25] blotches on my skin I was just I was in
[30:28] that case and so the insides of me are
[30:31] also getting [ __ ] up so in this
[30:34] process my soul has mostly got real
[30:37] tight to my t12 I can show you the bump
[30:40] on the back of my head after this show
[30:41] is over but I had I started growing this
[30:44] [ __ ] like large tumor or looking bump
[30:46] on the back of my head from my body
[30:48] compressing so I'm six foot one but my
[30:50] muscles were like five foot nine because
[30:52] I just started just the muscle tightness
[30:54] for my so ass going to my t12 I was just
[30:58] getting tighter my quads everything
[30:59] getting tired from just stress just
[31:01] stress in my life so the more I stressed
[31:04] my body with the workouts
[31:06] my lower body became out of balance so I
[31:09] had a bunch of stress fractures bunch of
[31:11] injuries going through buds and how I
[31:14] got through buds was they gave me my
[31:16] third time was my last time going
[31:18] through hell week I basically put a
[31:20] black sock on at four o'clock in the
[31:22] morning and I would get duct-taped I had
[31:24] a numerous stress fractures on both of
[31:26] my legs because my my body was literally
[31:28] like coming in on itself in my legs like
[31:32] I was I was pronating it really bad and
[31:34] putting stress on my stress on my shins
[31:36] and so I would put duct tape I would
[31:39] duct tape my feet and I would show you
[31:40] the top of them where I have pressure
[31:41] ulcers they're the size of quarters from
[31:44] you know how the ankle joint so the foot
[31:47] goes to the shin and how you move this
[31:49] where the tape was so tight it just
[31:52] created a nice ulcer right there and I
[31:56] just uh just kept going through it so
[31:59] you just use that tape to just support
[32:00] your ankles right so I basically cast
[32:02] myself and for the first 30 45 minutes
[32:05] the pain was excruciating but then it
[32:07] would go numb and I would go numb and
[32:10] then I saw I got through Wow did that do
[32:14] any long-term damage oh yeah I've been
[32:17] out for five years so I retired from the
[32:20] I did 21 years in military this time in
[32:22] the Air Force and I did about 16 years
[32:23] in the Navy how old you 43 she looks
[32:27] like you're 30 that's good that's good
[32:29] you really you look very young for your
[32:30] age whenever I'm stressed I get after it
[32:32] I think I fixed was ever bothering me so
[32:36] I basically over the last five years
[32:40] everything I've done in my life I did it
[32:42] be very unhealthy I've never talked
[32:45] about it I just kept going and it cost
[32:48] me pretty much I was choking my insides
[32:50] out adrenal issues tons of general
[32:52] issues thyroid issues anything with the
[32:54] endocrine system pretty much shut down
[32:56] on me a lot my organs were pretty much
[32:58] shutting down and I went from a guy who
[33:00] could run 205 miles to a guy who
[33:02] couldn't get a bed and the doctors were
[33:04] trying to search what was wrong that's
[33:05] why I figure out the psoas muscle no one
[33:07] figured it out and I hit it by accident
[33:10] so I I've missed two days of stretching
[33:14] out in five years and so what happened
[33:17] was all this should I did to myself this
[33:19] dress I
[33:19] under physical mental all kind of [ __ ]
[33:21] it just choked me out from the inside
[33:24] and doctors put me all kind of
[33:27] medication and the medication started
[33:29] doing the exact opposite it was kind of
[33:30] sure I was on um DHEA I was on some
[33:35] different things for my estrogen
[33:37] different things for my I was on
[33:40] anything to do with your with your
[33:42] endocrine system thyroid medicine get
[33:46] God I was on quarters all kind of [ __ ]
[33:49] to get my stuff I'd like just lump in my
[33:52] throat from like the heart was always I
[33:54] couldn't run down the street my body was
[33:57] just jacked up couldn't sleep my hope I
[33:59] was just down shutting down I could give
[34:01] you a lot more than that but just give
[34:02] me example I was [ __ ] dying and so I
[34:05] couldn't do anything I went from a guy
[34:06] who was this guy to a guy who can't do
[34:09] [ __ ] and doctors like I don't know
[34:11] what's wrong with you me you know your
[34:12] labs or this is it PTSD is it what's
[34:15] going on I knew what any of that [ __ ] so
[34:18] I sat in the bed one day and I realized
[34:19] man my life is over this is it but it
[34:22] gave me time to reflect on everything
[34:24] I'd accomplished I've never taken time
[34:26] to reflect on the kid I was to the man I
[34:30] am now so honestly the time I wasn't
[34:32] working out it was the best time I live
[34:35] because I got a chance to really reflect
[34:36] back and be proud of who I became guy
[34:39] never took time to do that it was like
[34:41] one after another get the [ __ ] after get
[34:43] after it get after you ain't good
[34:44] nothing my [ __ ] get after it get after
[34:46] it and I'm I got halted so anyway this
[34:50] process went on for a while more
[34:52] medication this isn't working that's not
[34:53] working no doctor can figure it out I'm
[34:56] like [ __ ] it I saw this doc about eight
[34:59] years before this happened he was like
[35:01] hey man you're so [ __ ] tight I've
[35:03] never seen anybody in my life as tight
[35:05] as you you need 50,000 hours of
[35:08] stretching he's doing some crazy number
[35:10] I like whatever stretching the you know
[35:13] it stretch stress is bad for you so you
[35:16] thought stretch was but that's just bad
[35:17] for you why did you think that I read
[35:19] some article you know a man [ __ ] [ __ ]
[35:22] stretching man I worked out so hard I
[35:25] don't have time to stress man I was 150
[35:27] miles a week I was biking to work man I
[35:29] was getting after it man I was working a
[35:30] full-time job
[35:32] and stretching and doing that so my body
[35:35] was literally getting tired and tired
[35:36] not just from what I was doing but
[35:38] there's all cuz you ran this nut wasn't
[35:39] that man and so I said no I'm gonna try
[35:43] to stretch out so I don't do anything
[35:45] for like ten minutes
[35:46] or you know I don't do to a six-minute
[35:49] abs [ __ ] so I start stretching out
[35:51] one hour hour and a half long story
[35:54] short man I shaved my head unless every
[35:55] morning and that bump doesn't the back
[35:58] of my [ __ ] head I started realizing
[36:00] it was shrinking for some [ __ ] reason
[36:01] I don't know why because I shaved my
[36:03] head back and I was like it's getting
[36:05] smaller smaller that bump got healthier
[36:08] I got smaller that bump got I was like
[36:10] oh hold up [ __ ] what's going on
[36:12] that so whereas muscle started getting
[36:14] more and more stressed out more more
[36:16] relaxed and over a period of five years
[36:17] I'm the best shape in my damn life right
[36:19] now from stretching out Wow that's all
[36:23] it was I went from like I came in
[36:25] counting medications I was on now I'm on
[36:28] a very low dose thyroid pill period do
[36:31] you ever do yoga all the time man all
[36:34] the time and I if I were to tell
[36:37] somebody one thing right now man that's
[36:39] so as muscle and getting that hip flexor
[36:42] opened up because we're all stressed the
[36:43] [ __ ] out it was it's almost worse than
[36:46] others it changed my life yeah how do
[36:50] you say Nick Gregorius how do you say
[36:52] his last name
[36:53] the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt from
[36:56] England the Greek fella he has a great
[36:59] quote about yoga he said yoga is a
[37:02] martial art you do against yourself yep
[37:03] it's a great way of putting it a hundred
[37:06] percent so what it feels like when
[37:07] you're in there right hundred percent
[37:08] and so you how many years ago was this
[37:13] it was five years ago anything and how
[37:15] long was there a period where you
[37:17] couldn't work out at all there was about
[37:18] so I always try to do something but I
[37:21] couldn't run hardly though I could run
[37:22] maybe half a mile and all that hard [ __ ]
[37:25] would happen in my heart would get a fit
[37:27] and I'll cast off what happened and I
[37:29] started just stretching and also I tried
[37:31] to pull ups every now and then but
[37:33] everything was just I didn't have the
[37:34] energy I didn't have anything I mean
[37:37] nothing was processing right for me so
[37:39] do you think that you just broke in your
[37:41] body you pushed it too hard hundred
[37:43] percent
[37:44] sat back in that bed that night and I
[37:46] had a lot of time to reflect us you know
[37:47] what I was actually kind of proud of
[37:49] myself in a very sick twisted way I even
[37:53] though people would understand it I had
[37:55] to do what I had to do and you know and
[37:58] I did it like I didn't tell you how I
[38:00] got into ultrarunning
[38:01] you know there's a lot of things that so
[38:04] I I pushed extremely hard I went way
[38:08] beyond what I thought was capable like
[38:11] my first ultra race I did I was uh I was
[38:13] heavier I was in Iraq you know the
[38:15] marcus luttrell lone survivor I was in
[38:18] buds I was in three hell weeks as you
[38:19] know as I said many times and I knew a
[38:21] lot of guys that died in the operation
[38:23] now I was at freefall school with
[38:25] marking the trail who is his twin
[38:26] brother during the operation wet wings
[38:28] wear market rosin on a survivor
[38:30] I knew market real well and I was about
[38:34] 200 some odd pounds and I didn't run
[38:36] hardly at all at this time I was a seal
[38:38] but I was like a bodybuilder
[38:40] and I did it elliptical trainer 20
[38:43] minutes on Sunday all I did so I did
[38:46] [ __ ] that cardio stuff I was never about
[38:48] it until this happened so that happened
[38:52] and I was like man I gotta find a way to
[38:53] raise money for these families so I
[38:55] googled the I I found a foundation the
[38:58] Special Operations Warrior Foundation
[38:59] and I googled the 10 hardest races in
[39:02] the world I knew nothing about ultra
[39:04] running the first I'd ever run was 20
[39:06] miles at one time and so what came up
[39:09] was the bad water 135 135 mile run
[39:12] through Death Valley in the summertime I
[39:13] thought was a [ __ ] stage race I know
[39:16] people can run her 35 miles at one time
[39:18] had no idea was imminent stage race
[39:20] would you run like 20 miles I'll camp
[39:22] out and then run 20 more to get her 35
[39:25] miles right so I wouldn't alter runner
[39:28] to know ultra runner was I called the
[39:29] race director up Chris Kaufman of the
[39:31] bad water spinning he said are you an
[39:34] ultra runner and I was like I don't know
[39:36] what that is
[39:37] he goes have you run 100 miles in 24
[39:39] hours or less I was like no but I said
[39:41] I'm a Navy SEAL I was in 3 Heloise I was
[39:44] arranged I gave him some resume he
[39:45] didn't give a [ __ ] he said I don't care
[39:48] you got qualified for my race and the
[39:50] deadline was up in two months for this
[39:52] bad water race and basically he said
[39:55] there's two more races you can do to
[39:56] qualify
[39:57] and I might consider you my race we
[39:59] select top 90 athletes in the world and
[40:01] you know even all true runner but I like
[40:03] your cause like what you're doing he
[40:05] said uh I come up on a Wednesday and he
[40:07] goes there's a race on Saturday in San
[40:10] Diego San Diego one day when you run
[40:13] around a one-mile track for 24 hours
[40:15] Samiha miles you get if you get 100 24
[40:17] hours I will consider you in my race I
[40:19] did the math 14 some minute mile [ __ ] it
[40:22] I can do that dumb [ __ ] thinking I'll
[40:26] tell you that right now
[40:27] it was rough worst pain I've been in my
[40:29] entire life or this race so I have my
[40:33] wife that time she's not my ex-wife we
[40:35] go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz
[40:36] crackers in my licks that's what I'm
[40:39] gonna have for a hundred mile run
[40:40] so show up at the start line this race
[40:42] it was a you a national championships
[40:46] it's like the best ultra runners compete
[40:48] against each other to Sydney miles you
[40:50] can get in 24 hours and I'm this big
[40:53] bodybuilder looking guy but there's do
[40:55] it like them I would say I was at least
[40:58] 230 at least it may have been more than
[41:01] jacked yeah oh yeah I was ripped to [ __ ]
[41:04] up I'm a big ol chest out date I was I
[41:06] was jacked up there's a picture I mean
[41:08] he definitely didn't look like someone
[41:09] who could run a home run no not at all
[41:11] so basically I start running and I get
[41:15] to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling
[41:18] pretty good I get to mile 70 and it was
[41:22] the worst pain of my life i sat down
[41:26] this blue lawn chair at Mile 70 and my
[41:29] the rich crackers after mile 20 became
[41:32] wrist cracker bong sky wasn't hydrating
[41:33] correctly I don't know what to do I was
[41:36] drinking mile Plex for my nutrition
[41:38] because I couldn't eat these rich
[41:39] crackers have very minimal water if any
[41:41] at all and I was just dying so I sat
[41:44] down this blue lawn chair as I was
[41:46] watching lies runners go around in this
[41:47] circle and I was all dizzy and
[41:49] lightheaded hadn't gone in the bathroom
[41:50] it's been about 12 hours I went 70 miles
[41:52] about 12 hours which is good and I
[41:54] looked at my ex-wife now and I was like
[41:56] I am [ __ ] I started seeing like three
[41:59] of her and once my body stopped my mind
[42:03] just went off and I had to go to the
[42:05] bathroom and the bathroom is like it's
[42:08] like 20 feet away from me if that not
[42:10] Cooney
[42:11] and so I sat there and pee blood down my
[42:12] leg and start crapping up my back and
[42:14] for 30 miles to go I am my feet were
[42:17] broken I was just in the worst shape
[42:20] because once you stopped running not
[42:22] running like that I mean I didn't run in
[42:24] almost a year I was just doing body
[42:26] building stuff and 20 minutes on the
[42:28] elliptical trainer no running at all I
[42:31] probably ran no [ __ ] no [ __ ] no more
[42:35] than 50 miles the whole year that wasn't
[42:39] my thing I want it to be like jacked you
[42:41] know I didn't want to be cardio guy I
[42:43] want to be ripped big Navy SEAL guy and
[42:46] um in the day before this race is funny
[42:50] this guy named Joe Burns who put me
[42:52] through my hell weeks a SIL guy he's one
[42:54] of the hardest guys out there he was in
[42:56] the gym the Friday before I did this
[42:58] race and he was doing a full body squats
[43:01] deadlifts power cleans I get my own you
[43:04] know he he's a guy that proved me to do
[43:05] this race you know he gave me the
[43:07] approval to go do this race and signed
[43:09] off on it so I'm in the gym I went in
[43:12] there did a full-body hardcore squats
[43:14] deadlifts and everything with this guy
[43:16] because I knew he was gonna come watch
[43:18] me in this race so I've always been
[43:21] about all right man you're gonna see me
[43:22] coming here and Jack this weight and the
[43:24] more you watch me do a hundred mile run
[43:26] we can think about that so basically I
[43:30] paid for it so at my so he came out
[43:32] there with my favorite thing chocolate
[43:34] you know mini doughnuts because he knew
[43:36] my story of my past life and brought the
[43:38] six minute doughnuts out there and I'll
[43:40] have my hat pulled down and at Mile 70
[43:42] men it was torturous and with blood down
[43:45] my leg and 30 miles to go I started
[43:51] reaching the cookie jars man I started
[43:52] pulling off all kind of stuff I reached
[43:55] in my mind and a lot of us when we have
[43:57] bad times in life even the hardest
[43:59] person where we forget how badass we are
[44:01] during that hard time I have a thing
[44:04] where I take a couple seconds to reflect
[44:06] on I hang on man you've meant to been
[44:08] through this you've been through that
[44:09] you overcame this overcame that I don't
[44:11] ever close my mind to the fact that this
[44:14] can't be done
[44:14] and I knew I had to get up I need
[44:17] nutrition I need hydration I need to get
[44:19] stop being dizzy so that's the first
[44:22] thing I did I didn't panic gonna have 30
[44:23] more miles to go to get
[44:25] I start about the process slowly but
[44:28] surely I was able to stand up and I was
[44:30] literally hobbling around this track
[44:32] we're just walking no running at all I
[44:34] couldn't run my feet were in the worst
[44:36] pain it's the worst pain I've been in my
[44:37] entire life nothing in any training is
[44:40] even a comparable to this last 30 miles
[44:43] and what happened was my ex-wife looked
[44:46] at me and she's like man you're this we
[44:48] agreed I'm not gonna make the time I was
[44:50] going way too slow
[44:51] and at that time at mile 81 something
[44:55] clicked that I'll never probably be able
[44:57] to do again where my mind body spirit
[44:58] soul everything disconnected and my mind
[45:01] knew I wasn't [ __ ] around anymore it
[45:04] knew it wasn't gonna quit it knew that
[45:06] guy was dead and buried and gone and I
[45:09] was gonna die out here on this [ __ ]
[45:11] Walmart for whatever reason why I was
[45:14] gonna get through this [ __ ] I
[45:15] didn't give a damn it made no there was
[45:17] no [ __ ] crowds there was no trophy at
[45:19] the end there was I wasn't even in a
[45:20] race in my mind there was it was nothing
[45:23] it weren't about nothing there was no
[45:25] nothing it was a bunch of people who
[45:27] didn't know who the [ __ ] I was it was me
[45:29] against me and I used all these
[45:32] different dark places to start bringing
[45:34] out light and just [ __ ] going deeper
[45:36] and deeper in it running the next 20
[45:38] miles around 101 miles and I ran the
[45:41] next 20 miles ran at about a 1030 pace
[45:44] and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and 56
[45:48] minutes sat back down that blue
[45:51] port-a-potty now my chair that got from
[45:54] Walmart and that's when the body
[45:56] realized I was done and this great
[46:00] feeling came over me but also the worst
[46:02] pain in my life I that's when I took a
[46:04] humongous [ __ ] on myself literally like
[46:07] I like a [ __ ] log up my [ __ ] back
[46:09] piss so much blood down and my wife was
[46:12] she was a nurse and she was freaked out
[46:15] I couldn't get up I couldn't stand up
[46:17] she backed this Camry on the knoll of
[46:20] the grassy area I was at and we were
[46:23] both lifters at the time so she was
[46:25] decently strong I put my arms around her
[46:26] neck she got me to the backseat of the
[46:28] car that the windows down cos smelled
[46:29] like horrible [ __ ] and I had this poncho
[46:32] line because November in San Diego so
[46:34] I'm sitting there Jack him in the back
[46:35] his car and she was terrified anything
[46:37] dr. Anita
[46:39] that's take me home so we look in the
[46:42] second story or the second deck of this
[46:44] apartment complex in San Diego I got to
[46:48] the first deck so I get a car and I
[46:50] could stand up but with my arms on her
[46:51] neck so just leaning down I was gonna
[46:53] pass out got to the second or I got to
[46:56] the first deck went down just couldn't
[46:58] stand up anymore got around her neck
[47:01] worked up my way up the railing
[47:03] gamma-gamma I was on her neck again
[47:05] walked to the kitchen area which is
[47:07] right in the front door I was laying on
[47:09] a poncho liner crap was everywhere
[47:11] I managed she helped me manage to get
[47:14] into the toilet into the tub and it's
[47:16] like dirt was coming on my penis
[47:18] this looked horrible just just that
[47:20] grossly in the world it was worst pain I
[47:22] can ever ever ever be in in my life and
[47:25] the craziest thing I tell your story
[47:27] because it's right now I'm not sadistic
[47:28] I'm not crazy people may think that any
[47:30] way they may want to put a title on me
[47:32] after hearing me because it makes them
[47:33] feel better because they think wow this
[47:36] guy must be some special or just [ __ ]
[47:38] up crazy dude no I'm a guy that came
[47:41] from nothing anybody's capable of doing
[47:43] [ __ ] like this anybody and I sat in that
[47:47] tub she's put the water on me she called
[47:49] my mom up and my mom was dating a doctor
[47:52] at the time the doctor he actually said
[47:53] you need to get him to a hospital now
[47:55] she came back in all I want to do is
[47:57] call Chris Koster on the phone the race
[47:59] director of bad waters I [ __ ] did it
[48:01] so she some taken to doctor I said no
[48:03] let me sit here enjoy this pain she said
[48:06] what are you talking about I said you
[48:08] don't I go I need to go to the doctor I
[48:10] realize that but I never thought it was
[48:14] humanly possible to do what I did I went
[48:18] 70 miles in at 70 miles I was dead I was
[48:23] at a hundred percent what I thought what
[48:27] I thought was 100%
[48:28] I went 30 I went 31 more miles after
[48:32] being in the worst physical shape I've
[48:35] ever been in in my life and all that all
[48:38] that pain and suffering and thing was
[48:40] going through my [ __ ] body and I sat
[48:42] in that tub and the waters hitting me it
[48:44] was the most amazing feeling of
[48:47] accomplishment and I want to be numb I
[48:50] want people to give me drugs and
[48:52] numbness [ __ ] pain I wanted to I did
[48:54] this however as crazy as it sounds it
[48:58] was the most amazing moment of my entire
[48:59] life to overcome such to come from this
[49:02] kid who was mentally torturing something
[49:06] was torture is talk to this kid - Skyy
[49:09] now who was able to overcome such
[49:11] amazing odds and obstacles and I called
[49:14] Chris cost him up the race director of
[49:16] bad water and he said the idea of a
[49:18] 24-hour race is to run 24 hours you
[49:21] really ran 19 and he put doubt in my
[49:24] mind that he was that mean - bad water
[49:25] so a month later or so about a month and
[49:29] half later I went this race called the
[49:30] hurt 100 so hundred mile race in Hawaii
[49:33] 26,000 feet of climb was all he said
[49:35] that's all he said that's so crazy I
[49:38] mean he's a hardcore dude but he didn't
[49:40] know how [ __ ] up I was right and he
[49:43] said he didn't say well you know I can't
[49:46] say no I might let you win
[49:47] he put enough doubt in my mind and say
[49:49] man I got to do more so I was broken I
[49:54] was broken bad and like how long does it
[49:57] take you to recover physically the
[49:59] funniest thing about this I'll tell a
[50:00] story very often I had signed up for I'm
[50:03] getting to that answer it's right now

[50:07] mom signed up for the first Las Vegas

[51:45] my feet broke my body I'm like this man
[51:47] he's the biggest [ __ ] liar on the
[51:49] planet or ain't nobody know [ __ ] even
[51:51] why I tell my story it almost sounds
[51:53] like some made-up [ __ ] so yes crazies
[51:56] you ran a hundred miles before you ever
[51:58] ran a marathon right then you didn't run
[52:00] again at all and he's still qualified
[52:02] for the Boston Marathon so you ran a 308
[52:05] right for the first marathon you ever
[52:08] did ever did two weeks after you ran a
[52:10] hundred miles right with no training and
[52:12] nothing in between but it gets better
[52:13] than that you can see my training log to
[52:16] actually post it up so that's when I
[52:19] started training for the hurt 100 so
[52:24] basically what happened was after that I
[52:26] had about four weeks what did it feel
[52:29] like to run that 308 if you could barely
[52:31] walk when that gun went off something
[52:34] went off in my head and I didn't feel
[52:37] that much pain at all afterwards I did
[52:40] but something happened where I was like
[52:43] the gun went off and that thing came
[52:46] back like all right man what if because
[52:50] I want to qualify for Boston that was my
[52:52] goal but I was I was jacked up you know
[52:56] and I and I and I didn't run as much
[52:58] that sort of at all over my Iraq
[53:01] training I hit the weights and but my
[53:04] job but but my goal was my son that
[53:05] forward a year early
[53:06] I want to qualify for Boston which was a
[53:09] three 10:59 and I was like what if you
[53:13] can qualify for Boston mayor and so we
[53:15] wit helped me out I spent 101 miles
[53:19] what the [ __ ] is 26 miles to me now so
[53:22] the mindset going into it was like I ran
[53:24] 75 more miles in this so I use it to my
[53:28] advantage so after that happened I ran
[53:30] but my feet pretty much broken I would
[53:33] go to the physical therapist and they
[53:35] had this compression tape compressing
[53:37] tape help because I'm my feet were
[53:39] pretty bad off and I would run 7080
[53:42] hundred mile weeks and then I went to
[53:44] the hurt 100 race in Hawaii 26,000 feet
[53:47] of climbing over 100 miles probably one
[53:50] of the top five hardest hundred mile
[53:52] races in the world
[53:52] I wouldn't even a real runner yeah I
[53:56] baked a lot of miles by the last the
[53:58] last but two and a half about two months
[54:00] but I want a runner went out there and
[54:02] got through the race did in 33 hours
[54:05] with a ninth place finisher
[54:06] not many people finished that that year
[54:08] and I qualified for bad water and got in
[54:11] and I went on to lose weight and train
[54:14] hard and I got fifth my first year I
[54:16] went back my second year and got there
[54:17] when you say you went you lost weight
[54:19] like what were you eventually way in so
[54:22] I went to the race about 190 we lost
[54:25] quite a bit yeah bodybuilding time right
[54:27] that's over a short period of time right
[54:29] how did you lose all that way once again
[54:30] I I just worked out hard I stopped
[54:33] taking my protein so much I got off I
[54:36] was on this stuff called a nitro tech
[54:38] and I got off all the protein stuff I
[54:41] started I stopped hitting the weights so
[54:43] hard and I just became a running fool
[54:47] became the Black Forest got man pretty
[54:49] much pretty simple man that's what
[54:51] happened now when you say you were using
[54:53] compression tape on your feet and that
[54:55] your feet were jacked up what was the
[54:56] extent of the injuries so basically
[54:58] because of my pronation that I never
[55:00] figured out cuz my soul has muscles I
[55:04] always had issues with stretch fractures
[55:06] shin splints so I put a lot of pressure
[55:08] on the inside of my ankles and so that
[55:11] there's this tendon that goes up the
[55:13] backside of your I don't know if it's
[55:16] your fibula my backside that of that
[55:19] little bone backs out your foot it goes
[55:21] right up beside that lot right alongside
[55:23] that bone and that thing was just so
[55:26] fluid up on both sides that even this
[55:29] flexing my foot was just killing me so I
[55:32] when you can you know when you cast that
[55:34] thing up casting my feet always helped
[55:36] me out because it it it locked my foot
[55:39] into a position that wouldn't made me
[55:40] pronate as much so between the casting
[55:43] of that and if you watched the a bad
[55:45] water video of 2006 you see me crossing
[55:48] the finish line with this compression
[55:49] tape literally like flying on my ankles
[55:53] because I went to the race with
[55:55] compression tape on my ankles and so
[55:57] basically I'd have that on my you know
[56:00] on my ankles I had inserts in my you
[56:03] know in my shoes and also this wedge on
[56:06] the back heel of my left foot so then it
[56:09] would keep me from pronating that heel
[56:10] so much so I had all that on just to go
[56:12] around
[56:13] and I ran my ass off and went to bad
[56:16] water 2006 and with compression tape on
[56:20] my feet and walked a lot but I got third
[56:24] place do you always run with regular
[56:26] running shoes I do yeah so now I don't
[56:28] have those issues anymore all the
[56:30] stretching has opened my body up to
[56:31] where I know how it should have been so
[56:33] my alignment is pretty good it's not
[56:35] perfect so now I just run in regular
[56:37] running shoes now no no more compression
[56:39] tape no more none that stuff so if you
[56:41] see now if you look down there you'll
[56:42] see they can press it up and you'll see
[56:44] my ex-wife here in a second taking their
[56:47] compression tape off of me she's doing
[56:49] it right now
[56:49] you see her right now you know she said
[56:51] tape yeah so that's the tape I didn't
[56:54] have to wear every day of my life to run
[56:55] Wow so as you see the story may be kind
[56:59] of unbelievable but there's some proof
[57:01] right there so that's how I was so
[57:04] painful yeah I was pretty [ __ ] up as
[57:06] you see right now me trying to get all
[57:08] man yeah I'm pretty destroyed right
[57:10] there what is the most amount of miles
[57:12] you've ever run at one time yeah two
[57:15] hundred and five and thirty nine hours
[57:17] Wow non-stop whoo yeah I've had quite a
[57:22] few people on I've met quite a few
[57:24] people now over the last year so that
[57:26] have run ultras Courtney doe Walter you
[57:29] know she is she won the Moab okay yeah I
[57:32] heard my 40 rather heard about yes she
[57:34] she beat all the men by 22 miles
[57:37] something like that some crazy things
[57:40] she was first place winner she beat
[57:41] everybody else
[57:42] second place one word
[57:44] and with her I mean you would never
[57:46] believe it wouldn't talk to her she
[57:48] seemed so normal right she drinks beer
[57:50] and eats nachos needs candy ultrarunner
[57:53] man she's just silly and she's fun
[57:55] yep and there's no demon there I like
[57:58] waiting to meet a demon right you know
[58:00] I'm like where's your demon like how are
[58:02] you getting through her demons a quiet
[58:05] demon right it's it's there it has to be
[58:07] okay there's something there has to be
[58:09] there's no other people that everybody I
[58:11] know that that can do that as a demon a
[58:13] lot of us don't want admit to [ __ ] yeah
[58:15] we got him a hundred percent it has to
[58:17] be yeah so when you do this and you you
[58:22] qualify and you do that race in Hawaii
[58:25] right they just let you in after that no
[58:28] so the race in Hawaii yeah I actually
[58:30] called the race jerk threw up and there
[58:32] wasn't like a big time like I had to
[58:34] have 100-mile race I believe as I had
[58:36] and so you know 100-mile you did the
[58:39] boss of merit or you did the Vegas
[58:41] marathon yeah so I did a hundred mile
[58:43] 101 miles the Vegas marathon went to
[58:46] hurt 100 did that hundred mile ER and
[58:48] all this is in a very short amount of
[58:50] time yeah so November was the first time
[58:52] jamala December was the 26 mile or not
[58:55] in Las Vegas January was the next
[58:59] hundred miles on Hawaii you know [ __ ]
[59:01] crazy that is like say if I was your
[59:02] friend and I called you up on October
[59:04] 20th I go hey man how many times you run
[59:06] like run every night I see something
[59:08] crazy I'm gonna pull it up or not but if
[59:09] you can pull my race schedule for 2007
[59:11] this pull up David Goggins race results
[59:13] you can see something real crazy in a
[59:14] second they saying this is good and I
[59:17] gotta show you proof because why I know
[59:20] my story doesn't make any sense but this
[59:22] look at the dates of these races and
[59:24] we're gonna show it to you in a second
[59:26] it's um just look at the hundred miles
[59:29] and 15 hours back-to-back weekends how
[59:31] many weekends there were between races
[59:33] so if you look right here you can't
[59:34] really see it so he's look at 2007 yeah
[59:37] go all the way down keep on going 2007
[59:40] steals races there and do that okay get
[59:43] to right there so hundred mile or Hawaii
[59:45] oh gee looked up first two weeks later
[59:48] three weeks later another one that's
[59:49] 50-miler a 50-miler
[59:51] a month later then looking at what 14
[59:56] days later another 50k
[59:58] 50-miler month later they look at less
[01:00:01] than a month
[01:00:02] another 50-miler 53 milder in June July
[01:00:06] was another 100 miler bad water was
[01:00:08] literally reached that water was a month
[01:00:11] after I did that hundred mile or 135
[01:00:13] Marlette Ville was less than a month
[01:00:15] after bad water the plane 100 was three
[01:00:19] weeks after Leadville Angels crest was
[01:00:22] to attend date a week after that energy
[01:00:25] modeler the bare 100 was wet thirteen
[01:00:29] days after that hundred mile or she and
[01:00:31] then I ran the two hundred and it said
[01:00:33] to her and three point five but I didn't
[01:00:35] ran toward its 205 miles around there
[01:00:37] but what's not in there was that
[01:00:40] McNaughton race I did in two thousand or
[01:00:42] fifty mile race I also did in two
[01:00:45] thousand seven that wasn't lifted so
[01:00:47] that was just my 2007 year that's insane
[01:00:51] yeah so do you think that is what [ __ ]
[01:00:53] your body up no no no because I I still
[01:00:56] run the same mileage now well [ __ ] my
[01:00:58] body up was hell week really oh yeah you
[01:01:01] don't go through three hell weeks in one
[01:01:03] year so I so what happened was when I
[01:01:05] realized that my body is really jacked
[01:01:06] up was I went I was a big-time squatter
[01:01:09] loved squatting and I went through the
[01:01:12] first hell week got messed up ii hope
[01:01:14] you got all the way through then throw
[01:01:16] hope we could got all the way through
[01:01:17] and my third hell we could hit me that
[01:01:18] guy died on Thursday and then that hell
[01:01:21] weekend and I graduated pulmonary edema
[01:01:23] it was a code name was John stop it code
[01:01:27] is [ __ ] hell week the Pacific Oceans
[01:01:31] never warm and it rained the whole time
[01:01:33] the whole time is rain and he pretty
[01:01:36] much just drown on his own fluid pretty
[01:01:38] much we were in the pool doing some
[01:01:40] evolution he sunk to the bottom his
[01:01:42] temperature was hot he missed a lot of
[01:01:44] hell week for getting pulled out for
[01:01:46] different stuff he wouldn't go quit and
[01:01:47] I'm heating up dying he'll week but um
[01:01:50] yeah so anyway after hell week ended I
[01:01:54] want to go back to the gym you know so
[01:01:56] second phase happened I face like I can
[01:01:58] get back in the gym so I jacking my
[01:01:59] weight
[01:01:59] I love jack and weight and I realized I
[01:02:02] couldn't squat so I went from squatting
[01:02:05] a lot to I couldn't even squat the bark
[01:02:06] and my lower back was all [ __ ] up I
[01:02:08] was like I don't know what's going on
[01:02:09] it was cuz this this muscle so inhale
[01:02:13] week your hip flexors are so and I went
[01:02:16] through so many of them so fast
[01:02:17] and so the hardest part of buds I went
[01:02:20] through three times not not the healthy
[01:02:22] part yes one the hardest parts but it
[01:02:24] was the initial part of the where
[01:02:26] everybody sees on TV the log PT to surf
[01:02:30] torture the dad gone boats over your
[01:02:32] head law all that [ __ ] I went through
[01:02:34] that person three times in one year and
[01:02:37] over a period of time my hip flexors got
[01:02:40] so tight that is jacked me up it jacked
[01:02:44] me up for my hip flexor so so always
[01:02:46] being so cold and so stressed out and
[01:02:48] everything led up to it
[01:02:50] but this really was the part that I
[01:02:53] noticed I could squat before hell week
[01:02:54] or before my first time going to buds
[01:02:56] after after buds I couldn't I couldn't
[01:03:01] squat anymore do you just think it might
[01:03:03] just be because your body was exhausted
[01:03:05] no cuz I for 12 years so I would I would
[01:03:08] go back and tough it out like like with
[01:03:10] Joe burns he was squatting so I said
[01:03:12] [ __ ] I almost caught with Joe burns but
[01:03:14] I just couldn't squat cuz that that
[01:03:16] muscle was attached here at t12 so what
[01:03:18] was it doing - is it locking up it was
[01:03:20] pulling and so it made my hips feel like
[01:03:23] I couldn't sink my ass oh I couldn't
[01:03:26] sink so his incredible pain and then
[01:03:28] with the weight pushing me down and then
[01:03:31] trying to push up the pain was just is
[01:03:33] just too much so so this is all range of
[01:03:35] motion is always in motion issues yeah
[01:03:37] Wow that that's an important thing for
[01:03:39] my friend cam Haynes who doesn't stretch
[01:03:40] he's another friend of mine who runs
[01:03:43] ultra races he ran that moab 240 he's
[01:03:47] run the bigfoot 205 he's run a few of
[01:03:49] those right um i know he's listening go
[01:03:52] stretch dude yes support man it was
[01:03:54] especially if you work in that hard
[01:03:56] right if you're doing that much yeah
[01:03:58] you're you're definitely locking up he
[01:03:59] could barely touch his toes yeah that's
[01:04:01] not a good thing that's not good no no
[01:04:03] it comes back to hurt you inside pretty
[01:04:05] soon now how flexible you now cuz I
[01:04:06] would imagine you probably a [ __ ]
[01:04:07] ballerina at this point because sad when
[01:04:09] your brain I'm trying to get there I'm
[01:04:12] trying to get there so I stretch every
[01:04:14] night for at least two hours there's a
[01:04:15] thing that people said that it always
[01:04:17] pissed me off like because I'm pretty
[01:04:18] flexible they said oh you're naturally
[01:04:20] flexible people have a natural threshold
[01:04:22] like
[01:04:23] oh they don't like a doctor told me that
[01:04:25] I go you don't know what you're talking
[01:04:26] about I'm like you don't know what you
[01:04:27] talk about cuz most people don't push
[01:04:28] themselves past that pain that stretch
[01:04:31] pain alright people want to put a title
[01:04:32] on your mask
[01:04:33] easy for them oh yes exactly natural
[01:04:36] exactly now you don't work hard enough
[01:04:38] [ __ ] yeah people built like
[01:04:40] chimps aren't usually flexible right you
[01:04:42] have to you have to force yourself to do
[01:04:43] that's right and I know it because I had
[01:04:46] a friend my friend Tom our dog nah he
[01:04:47] was a football player Jack big fick dude
[01:04:50] terrible flexibility was taking
[01:04:51] Taekwondo with me
[01:04:52] and over the course of a couple years I
[01:04:54] saw that dude eventually develop a full
[01:04:56] split there you go and he just did it
[01:04:58] through his mind yes was everybody else
[01:05:00] was done training that guy would be on
[01:05:01] the mat constantly stretch and always
[01:05:03] working out cuz he had built his body up
[01:05:06] so strong through all those years of
[01:05:08] squatting and lifting yeah that he just
[01:05:10] you know he was all tense everything was
[01:05:12] just like this super powerful right but
[01:05:14] all like very tense that's why I stopped
[01:05:16] you know that's why I never stretched
[01:05:18] because I wanted that strength yeah yeah
[01:05:19] you want that tight muscle but no I
[01:05:21] don't think it is stupid yeah I think
[01:05:23] you're not supposed to stretch before
[01:05:24] you do big physical activities because I
[01:05:27] think it does like weaken you somewhat
[01:05:29] but I don't think being flexible overall
[01:05:31] makes you weak or not at all yeah what
[01:05:34] certainly doesn't from martial arts
[01:05:35] because you need that flexibility to
[01:05:37] have leg dexterity to be able to kick
[01:05:39] right it's got to be fluid where it's
[01:05:41] not tightened up by the restriction of
[01:05:43] the motion of your body I get it it's
[01:05:45] truth I just think people are for
[01:05:47] whatever reason and I'm one of those
[01:05:50] drone on too much about yoga I'm like
[01:05:53] one of those vegans it's like you got to
[01:05:54] do it man right he's trying
[01:05:56] I get it knowing like a born-again
[01:05:57] Christian or something I'm getting that
[01:05:59] way now man that way now for anybody
[01:06:02] does anything hard like you know if you
[01:06:04] do anything like with weightlifting type
[01:06:07] [ __ ] or martial arts type [ __ ] where
[01:06:10] it's just everything's explosion its
[01:06:12] lifting it's heavy
[01:06:13] push push push right yoga just will
[01:06:16] balance your [ __ ] out yeah well yeah
[01:06:19] really well man and there's all these
[01:06:20] people that resist it like there was
[01:06:22] some article recently that it was
[01:06:23] something along the lines of hot yoga is
[01:06:26] just trendy nonsense
[01:06:27] I've read that and then even in the
[01:06:29] article it talked about that there might
[01:06:31] be some benefits in terms of like the
[01:06:33] strengthening your arteries and they
[01:06:35] didn't even mention
[01:06:36] heat-shock proteins is a study going on
[01:06:38] right now I believe it's at Harvard one
[01:06:41] of my friends was telling me about it
[01:06:42] where they're they're trying to find the
[01:06:44] benefits of 90 minute hot yoga classes
[01:06:46] because they think it might mirror the
[01:06:49] observed benefits of sauna which they
[01:06:51] already know for a fact has big benefits
[01:06:55] because of your body producing heat
[01:06:56] shock proteins to deal with the heat
[01:06:58] right that's why I put that sauna in
[01:06:59] here man I go in that [ __ ] all the
[01:07:01] time well no one can tell me doesn't
[01:07:02] work that's big it's proof positive you
[01:07:04] changed my life it wasn't a medication
[01:07:06] or this or a dress it was stretching
[01:07:08] yeah it was yoga stretching all that
[01:07:10] stuff combined changed it well I just
[01:07:12] think it balances out your body in those
[01:07:14] static poses where you're just holding
[01:07:16] the pose and it just it works you out in
[01:07:20] a weird way
[01:07:21] that one's a person you just don't get
[01:07:22] lifting weights or hitting the bag or
[01:07:25] anything out you're just not gonna get
[01:07:25] that that kind of working out I can't
[01:07:27] agree with you more it's so difficult
[01:07:29] crazy get your ass off and [ __ ] and
[01:07:33] you're like this is like the silent
[01:07:34] struggle it's humbling nobody knows it's
[01:07:37] like if you see like two doorways right
[01:07:39] and one of them is like [ __ ] CT Ollie
[01:07:42] Fletcher's [ __ ] super pump iron
[01:07:46] addicts gym which is hard work and then
[01:07:49] right next to it is the yoga studio
[01:07:50] you're like well once you get done with
[01:07:52] all that hard work you'll go over to
[01:07:55] that yoga studio no there's two
[01:07:56] different kinds of hard work going on
[01:07:58] it's no joke two different kinds of hard
[01:08:00] work yes sir so what do you do now in
[01:08:03] terms of like you got over this five
[01:08:06] years ago you're in this bad situation
[01:08:08] when your body's not working right now
[01:08:09] everything's working great again well I
[01:08:11] had two heart surgeries also whoa yeah
[01:08:14] so you know your heart so I had a hole
[01:08:17] in it so you know you're not supposed to
[01:08:20] have a hole in your heart and be a seal
[01:08:21] and it reborn with it I was born with it
[01:08:24] it went undetected and me pushing so
[01:08:27] hard so around in 2009 I was trying to
[01:08:30] first race across America and I just
[01:08:34] couldn't go anymore another pitfall in
[01:08:35] my life was the hole and I was pretty
[01:08:38] much off active duty steel for three
[01:08:40] years yeah you know I had two hearts for
[01:08:41] them trying to fix it so the hole was
[01:08:43] significantly large look how big that
[01:08:45] they say it was as big as a quarter now
[01:08:48] Mike Holly Hill is it big as a quarter
[01:08:49] yeah that's
[01:08:50] a pretty big hole in your heart because
[01:08:51] they had to helix patches I'm like
[01:08:53] that's impossible that the helix patches
[01:08:56] they're in my heart so the two stents
[01:08:57] what is a helix patch it is like a
[01:08:59] little mesh very like what they do for
[01:09:02] hernias like something maybe something
[01:09:04] like that so they went through my
[01:09:06] femoral artery and they placed this
[01:09:08] patch but to go through your artery yeah
[01:09:09] everything my femoral artery yeah
[01:09:11] looking with a camera yeah whoa so what
[01:09:14] no the cameras down through my throat
[01:09:15] whoa and they put this catheter through
[01:09:18] my femoral artery get went to my heart
[01:09:20] they they went and they took this helix
[01:09:23] patch they place it in there and then
[01:09:26] they found out six months later that the
[01:09:28] hole wasn't covered up enough yet
[01:09:30] because always I mean in the huge patch
[01:09:32] was very damn big so they put it go back
[01:09:35] in there in 2010 how does the patch
[01:09:38] adhere to your heart I guess your heart
[01:09:40] heals around the patch so but how did
[01:09:42] they stick it in place I I guess they
[01:09:45] put it with the holes at uh-huh and then
[01:09:47] it kind of like inflates oh wow the hole
[01:09:49] is that and then that that thing goes in
[01:09:52] there and then it kind of covers a hole
[01:09:54] and in the heart so there's two things
[01:09:56] in my heart right now that the heart
[01:09:58] just kind of covered up whoa okay so
[01:10:00] there you go Jamie's got an image of it
[01:10:03] for us whoa so so it's attached to this
[01:10:07] little probe right and then they put it
[01:10:10] over the area where the injury is Wow
[01:10:14] that's insane yeah atrial septum defect
[01:10:16] if I had atrial septal defect so
[01:10:19] basically everything I had done I then
[01:10:21] got from medicine oh [ __ ] you do I'll be
[01:10:24] done that's so crazy that they could do
[01:10:26] that yeah so I was out for I was
[01:10:28] off-duty for three years so I stuck I
[01:10:30] was in a recruiting area for three years
[01:10:33] trying to get back on active duty and
[01:10:35] that was my life for three years so they
[01:10:38] put that patch in yep and now your
[01:10:41] heart's 100% 100%
[01:10:43] it sounds percent Wow yeah that's
[01:10:45] incredible yeah I was losing you know
[01:10:48] blood and I was just I was a bad off
[01:10:50] it's just amazing that you were able to
[01:10:52] do all that with a hole in your heart
[01:10:54] that's what the doctors were saying you
[01:10:55] know because eight naw I was a seal so
[01:10:56] when I went in and the doctor that found
[01:10:59] the hole are like so they'd gave me EKGs
[01:11:02] all this stuff once again
[01:11:03] may you after I ran like 205 miles you
[01:11:07] know Ryan made you're in great shape I'm
[01:11:09] like man I just don't feel good like
[01:11:11] walking up the stairs this making me
[01:11:13] jacked up so the doctor doc Shrek he's
[01:11:17] like you know gave me he can go to the
[01:11:18] doctor get an echocardiogram so I'm in
[01:11:21] there getting echocardiogram just
[01:11:23] chilling out in there and the guys
[01:11:24] talking to him he has his little wand in
[01:11:26] my heart
[01:11:26] we're bullshitting about stuff and he
[01:11:28] when people get quiet [ __ ] not good
[01:11:32] man so he's in there this has one of my
[01:11:34] heart chilling out yeah man we doing
[01:11:37] yeah you know what's going on now like
[01:11:41] he says I'll be right back
[01:11:42] he goes and gets a doctor doctor comes
[01:11:45] in puts thing I'm a heart the doctor
[01:11:48] gets another doctor now I'm just
[01:11:51] freaking the [ __ ] out I'm like okay cuz
[01:11:53] when it comes to your heart
[01:11:54] that was a big deal so they come back in
[01:11:57] they say hey we can stop the
[01:11:58] echocardiogram I mean he talked you out
[01:12:00] in the hallway you have a hole in your
[01:12:02] heart and the guy didn't know that I was
[01:12:05] he knew I was Navy god I don't think he
[01:12:07] was a seal because not me black guys are
[01:12:09] seals and he had a conversation about
[01:12:11] you know we gotta fix this real quick I
[01:12:14] said yeah I mean then I came up that I
[01:12:16] was the seal he said man you could have
[01:12:18] died jumping you could die diving you
[01:12:20] could have died into all this stuff cuz
[01:12:22] basically the hole in your heart if it
[01:12:24] gets plugged with something like
[01:12:26] anything like you know let's say you get
[01:12:27] a bubble from diving or something like
[01:12:30] that
[01:12:30] you got died right so I I I call it luck
[01:12:34] I call it look so I I got through two
[01:12:38] surgeries they put me back on they give
[01:12:40] you the first one yeah and when do they
[01:12:42] realize that it's not done not good
[01:12:44] enough so they take you back and you get
[01:12:45] a bubble study a bubble test so it's so
[01:12:48] they like literally send bubbles that
[01:12:50] way safe bubbles that way to see if the
[01:12:52] bubble goes through your heart so they
[01:12:54] have this this echocardiogram again and
[01:12:57] they hook you up I think to ID or
[01:12:59] something like that and they throw these
[01:13:01] bubbles through your heart and they see
[01:13:03] if it goes through after six months when
[01:13:06] I should've been healed up the bubble
[01:13:08] went through so had to tell me then hey
[01:13:11] we got a you know you're not you're not
[01:13:14] good to go so
[01:13:15] I had to take a year before I have
[01:13:19] another surgery because because that
[01:13:21] patch had to be completely completely
[01:13:24] healed so they can go back in time you
[01:13:27] knew you had a hole right so so then you
[01:13:29] add a hole because of the heart surgery
[01:13:30] probably all this time like when you're
[01:13:32] waiting for it details you know you have
[01:13:33] an extra hole yes I don't have a hole
[01:13:35] yes
[01:13:36] what were you allowed to do with your
[01:13:37] body then well at that time they go you
[01:13:39] know do how you feel comfortable and so
[01:13:42] you know the hole is not going to kill
[01:13:44] you right now but you can't die if you
[01:13:47] can't jump you pretty much wouldn't
[01:13:48] steal anymore so I was a recruiter for a
[01:13:50] period of time so basically I was crazy
[01:13:55] about that is before my second surgery I
[01:13:57] was actually training for Delta Force I
[01:14:00] was I wanted to go to Delta and I was
[01:14:04] rucking ruck running a lot and before my
[01:14:07] second truck running I mean you're
[01:14:08] running with a package I pack on my back
[01:14:09] with some weight on how heavy is the
[01:14:11] pack 50 60 pounds and you run with that
[01:14:13] on well you're supposed to hike or hump
[01:14:15] like ruck hopping right I ran with it
[01:14:18] because I was you know I that's what I
[01:14:21] did right so the date of the day of the
[01:14:24] day of heart surgery I did a ruck run
[01:14:27] Jesus because I knew I was gonna be out
[01:14:30] of commission for a while so [ __ ] it
[01:14:33] matter get my last one in dude Jesus
[01:14:35] Christ all I could do I have my training
[01:14:37] launch after my second heart surgery all
[01:14:39] I could do was walk so I became an ultra
[01:14:41] Walker I walked my [ __ ] ass off and I
[01:14:45] over a period of time it took a year for
[01:14:47] that thing to heal up in the hill you
[01:14:49] know my first bubble study after my
[01:14:51] second heart surgery came back negative
[01:14:52] or positive the bubble went through
[01:14:55] again oh no and they're gonna crack me
[01:14:57] open oh man over that period of time my
[01:15:00] heart healed around that thing nicely
[01:15:02] and I passed a second bubble test so the
[01:15:04] first bubble test was how long after a
[01:15:06] year it was so the first bubble test
[01:15:08] after the first surgery was six months
[01:15:10] and then you had to go through a full
[01:15:12] six months after that variety heal then
[01:15:14] you have the second heart surgery and
[01:15:16] when does the bubble test fail after the
[01:15:18] second heart surgery it was about six
[01:15:20] months Jesus Christ and they said and
[01:15:21] the doctor looked at me and said you
[01:15:22] know I'm sorry to inform you maybe we
[01:15:24] have to crack your chest open the next
[01:15:26] time they're really getting there
[01:15:27] and so I sat back thinking this could be
[01:15:29] a third heart surgery and then that one
[01:15:34] they said we have to wait for six months
[01:15:36] to see if this thing's gonna close up
[01:15:37] right yeah I came back thinking man I'm
[01:15:40] about to get cracked the [ __ ] open and
[01:15:41] that bubble got pinned up man Wow when
[01:15:45] they go through maybe forced it through
[01:15:47] with your mind
[01:15:51] it may add something to visualize holy
[01:15:54] [ __ ] man that is crazy yeah it's crazy
[01:15:56] one on a ruck run with a hole in your
[01:15:58] heart - well I did it for several years
[01:16:00] I said [ __ ] it
[01:16:01] keep on going man that's amazing now
[01:16:06] after all said and done everything's
[01:16:08] good now yeah everything's I mean I'm
[01:16:10] sure supposed to pop up in my [ __ ]
[01:16:11] ass not to do that you know everything's
[01:16:13] good right now
[01:16:14] I'm always waiting for the next thing to
[01:16:15] pop up and I hang on the same way I was
[01:16:17] attack it but yeah I said right now I'm
[01:16:19] in the best shape my 43 years old just
[01:16:21] turned 43 February 17th I am in the best
[01:16:25] shape my life I'm not knocking on wood
[01:16:26] because life [ __ ] it life comes at you
[01:16:29] dude so right [ __ ] knocking on wood come
[01:16:31] at me I mean I would think that you
[01:16:33] would be a go-to guy for injuries yeah I
[01:16:36] give anybody had a ball I've had them
[01:16:38] all I found when you broke the world
[01:16:41] record for chin-ups didn't you rip your
[01:16:43] arm apart pull-ups yeah so if you pull
[01:16:44] up the picture man there's a picture of
[01:16:46] my hand you'll see I'll know what is it
[01:16:49] pull ups are so pull ups are here hands
[01:16:51] out hands out and chin ups our hands
[01:16:53] right hands forward so I failed three
[01:16:55] times before I finally got it the third
[01:16:58] time and I the first time I ripped the
[01:17:01] [ __ ] on my forearm and then the second
[01:17:04] time you'll see there's a picture of my
[01:17:07] hand and it it's a third-degree burn so
[01:17:11] that's my hand oh Jesus man what in the
[01:17:15] [ __ ] is going to look at you a bit by a
[01:17:17] wolf
[01:17:17] so what's funny about that as you see
[01:17:19] that uh that doesn't create after one
[01:17:21] pull-up so if you can imagine the pain
[01:17:23] of because you know you have one contact
[01:17:25] point that's it
[01:17:26] mmm you like running you can overcome it
[01:17:29] cuz it these big giant legs and right
[01:17:31] it's different when you have these
[01:17:32] little fragile
[01:17:33] punk-ass hands touching the bar no
[01:17:37] imagine four thousand thirty pull-ups
[01:17:39] how many times you're coming
[01:17:41] that bar coming off right now way 207
[01:17:43] pounds at the time so I was I was a
[01:17:45] bigger guy I'm like 195 or 185 now so I
[01:17:48] was almost 22 pounds heavier so I was a
[01:17:52] lot bigger than I am right there ma'am
[01:17:53] you look pretty get that [ __ ] man
[01:17:55] so you were doing it in sets of five
[01:17:57] sets of five so as you see I have these
[01:18:00] different people who are witnessing you
[01:18:02] you have to have your your your number
[01:18:05] there to make sure that you're you know
[01:18:07] qualified for the Guinness Book of World
[01:18:09] Record that's 1450 I have a long way to
[01:18:11] govern another four thousand and fifteen
[01:18:13] pull-ups to go hurt Jesus Christ so yeah
[01:18:17] and how long did you do this over 24
[01:18:19] hours it was seven so I brought it at 17
[01:18:21] Wow and I was [ __ ] over it what did
[01:18:25] it feel like in the last chin up
[01:18:27] you know what actually here's a video
[01:18:28] that we have and I was chasing this guy
[01:18:32] named Steven Highland so this guy named
[01:18:34] Steven Highland had the record and the
[01:18:37] video is my last three pulls for broke
[01:18:39] the record I'm talking so much [ __ ]
[01:18:40] there's another [ __ ] I'm like hey
[01:18:42] [ __ ] you thought was good get it

[01:18:50] but I felt um I felt nothing I was just
[01:18:53] happy I have to do anymore
[01:18:54] I just 67,000 pull-ups in nine months G
[01:18:58] in training first record for 4000 and
[01:19:01] the failures so I I did the first time
[01:19:04] in September failed miserably on this

[01:21:04] about getting the [ __ ] out of here but
[01:21:06] if you live this [ __ ] on a daily basis
[01:21:09] and you know how to calm your mind down
[01:21:10] this self-talk will help all that stuff
[01:21:12] will help but usually we react we have
[01:21:15] pain we have suffering we react and we
[01:21:17] react about get the [ __ ] out of here we
[01:21:20] got to go it's those people were able to
[01:21:22] control that [ __ ] feeling and [ __ ]

[01:21:51] watch these guys victorious
[01:21:53] and then you get the chance think about
[01:21:54] that you take that hot warm shower first
[01:21:57] thing that comes to your [ __ ] minds
[01:21:58] why the [ __ ] that I quit so what keeps
[01:22:00] me going
[01:22:01] I've quit several things I know what's
[01:22:04] on the back end the [ __ ] quitting
[01:22:05] it's a lifetime of thinking about why
[01:22:08] [ __ ] did I do that and I ain't [ __ ]
[01:22:11] doing that there's something about
[01:22:14] talking to a guy like you that a lot of
[01:22:16] people hope that you're gonna say some
[01:22:19] magic thing that's gonna click in their
[01:22:21] brain everybody gets change who they are
[01:22:23] like what is it what is the thing that's
[01:22:25] why people go to these self-help
[01:22:27] conferences and they take these classes
[01:22:30] and they hope that someone's gonna say
[01:22:33] something that changes the way their
[01:22:35] mind works it's hilarious to me it is
[01:22:37] it's kind of hilarious to me too but
[01:22:39] what is also hilarious is that what
[01:22:42] you're saying is that you have to do
[01:22:46] those things you have to suffer you have
[01:22:48] to live in it you have to be comfortable
[01:22:50] in it and then maybe some of that [ __ ]
[01:22:54] will help you a little bit along the way
[01:22:55] period and I went to I was a when I was
[01:23:00] a still recruiter I got invited to MIT
[01:23:02] smart ass [ __ ] there man I'm
[01:23:04] not that I miss a garanimal Dumber
[01:23:06] knuckle-dragger
[01:23:07] and there was this guy that I forget his
[01:23:11] name but he was like the top head head
[01:23:12] guy old white guy you know all genius
[01:23:16] doubt and we were on this panel and they
[01:23:19] were asking us all these questions about
[01:23:21] the mind mental toughness and [ __ ] he
[01:23:22] was answering them and I wasn't
[01:23:23] answering any questions now I'll never
[01:23:25] forget he was just answering off of
[01:23:27] theory mmm he never put his [ __ ] ass
[01:23:30] and [ __ ] you read a bunch of [ __ ]
[01:23:31] books and you think that you know how
[01:23:33] the [ __ ] mind works and [ __ ] I've
[01:23:35] gone through hell just a kid and then
[01:23:37] all the way up until now right so I know
[01:23:40] so that theory is [ __ ] yeah there's
[01:23:44] a lot of good stuff out there you can
[01:23:45] read from people but I had lived hell
[01:23:48] and when you put yourself in hell that's
[01:23:51] the only time you can figure out how the
[01:23:53] [ __ ] to get through that [ __ ]
[01:23:55] you can't you can't read somebody else's
[01:23:57] book about some theory on how to do [ __ ]
[01:23:59] some guy who was set up in there a nice
[01:24:01] warm office and read and wrote some book
[01:24:04] with a nice cup of coffee in the [ __ ]
[01:24:05] hand no I want to see that guy who put
[01:24:09] immersed himself in [ __ ] hell and he
[01:24:12] thought about quitting and leaving him
[01:24:14] and his wife and his kids and why am I
[01:24:16] here is it is it worth it all this crazy
[01:24:18] [ __ ] it still said if I
[01:24:22] not a way to get through it so basically
[01:24:25] that's that's the bottom line of it all
[01:24:27] we all want to read about how we can
[01:24:30] quickly get somewhere that's why that
[01:24:32] six-minute abs and also it's so powerful
[01:24:35] did you make it some results from it
[01:24:37] they're not permanent
[01:24:38] the permanent result comes from you
[01:24:41] [ __ ] I say it all time you have to
[01:24:44] suffer you have to make that a tattoo on
[01:24:48] your [ __ ] brain so when that hard
[01:24:51] time comes again you don't forget it
[01:24:54] you may forget it for a second but you
[01:24:56] can go back in the cookie jar call it
[01:24:58] it's a it's something that we've all
[01:25:00] indoors I call it the cookie jar and we
[01:25:03] often forget how hard we are but you got
[01:25:05] reflect back take a cup of sighs reflect
[01:25:07] I've been through this I've been through
[01:25:08] that and then remind yourself I'm a bad
[01:25:10] [ __ ] and then you can get do
[01:25:14] that [ __ ] but if you don't believe it
[01:25:15] you ever endured [ __ ] you're just
[01:25:18] blowing smoke man and you're not gonna
[01:25:20] get to anything what was this guy saying
[01:25:22] look what was his theories that he was
[01:25:23] throwing out there his theories was
[01:25:25] about I forget exactly what it was was
[01:25:26] there some about what the mind does
[01:25:28] under stress and how we can't he said
[01:25:33] how we can't do something and I did it I
[01:25:37] did what he said we couldn't do like
[01:25:39] what was he saying he couldn't do it was
[01:25:41] somebody if you're born if you're born a
[01:25:45] certain way somebody if you're born a
[01:25:47] certain way you can't become this way it
[01:25:52] was totally saying that would Who I am
[01:25:54] now like I had to be born with some not
[01:25:58] genetic power or some some gift from God
[01:26:01] but I had to have some kind of special
[01:26:02] gift had to have some kinda special gift
[01:26:05] I forget what set me off but was that we
[01:26:07] had to be - to be somewhere you had to
[01:26:10] be born with it what was the concept and
[01:26:13] I know what I was born with and I know
[01:26:16] the battle that I had in my mind so when
[01:26:19] he said it is sad to look at my face and
[01:26:21] some on the crowd ask me a question yeah
[01:26:24] I totally count addicted everything he
[01:26:25] said and I was like nah man I mean I
[01:26:27] [ __ ] know for a fact that you can be
[01:26:31] this [ __ ] up dude like really [ __ ]
[01:26:34] up dude
[01:26:35] and with the right mindset it is it
[01:26:39] sounds so easy with the right mindset
[01:26:41] doesn't sound easy
[01:26:42] it's know what you're saying it sounds
[01:26:44] very simplistic answer right you can you
[01:26:48] can't but you have to go into the dark
[01:26:50] chambers that we often shut off and you
[01:26:53] got to open them up you can open up and
[01:26:54] fight that [ __ ] demon get in there
[01:26:56] talk to that [ __ ] and say what's
[01:26:57] up and we often take that we all like to
[01:27:01] take this four-lane highway the easy
[01:27:03] highway has has [ __ ] signs it has
[01:27:06] restaurants we all loved that four-lane
[01:27:08] highway we always step over the shovel
[01:27:11] and all I did was I picked up that
[01:27:13] [ __ ] shovel and that shovel I made my
[01:27:16] own path and you may have big boulders
[01:27:18] and [ __ ] they may be getting towards and
[01:27:20] miles up the road faster than you but
[01:27:22] going through this path of life this
[01:27:23] journey over here that you make yourself
[01:27:25] that's incredibly difficult but it comes
[01:27:29] out to the other end of that
[01:27:29] [ __ ] is some glorious [ __ ]
[01:27:31] that you can't even explain to people
[01:27:33] and we're afraid bottom line is most of
[01:27:37] us even the people have all these
[01:27:38] theories and [ __ ] it's easier to accept
[01:27:40] the fact that I'm just not good enough I
[01:27:43] wasn't made to do that and yeah some of
[01:27:46] us can't be LeBron [ __ ] James but
[01:27:49] I'll tell you right now man we can do a
[01:27:51] lot of [ __ ] when it comes to this pure
[01:27:52] long guts and willpower and getting
[01:27:54] through [ __ ] we have a lot more with a
[01:27:56] lot more and we think we have yeah the
[01:27:58] problem with a guy like that with his
[01:28:00] theory is his theories of based on
[01:28:01] results and those results are based on
[01:28:03] human beings and most human beings
[01:28:05] there's certain people that are born
[01:28:07] with certain gifts like a guy like
[01:28:08] LeBron James is a physical talent you
[01:28:11] know John Jones and MMA obviously
[01:28:13] physical talent but there's when you
[01:28:17] look at someone who's super successful
[01:28:19] you always assume that it has to be
[01:28:22] because of some sort of physical gifts
[01:28:24] because people look at themselves and
[01:28:26] I'm sure this doctor this old dude
[01:28:29] probably had like a little gut and
[01:28:31] probably exactly I looked a little tiny
[01:28:33] arms weak shoulders and probably thought
[01:28:36] well there's certain people that are
[01:28:37] just mesomorphic and probably broke it
[01:28:39] down all these scientific terms right
[01:28:40] you know they just have a fast twitch
[01:28:43] muscle fibers and they'll say all this
[01:28:44] crazy [ __ ] that is true
[01:28:47] at the very highest levels of the
[01:28:49] winners right but it doesn't mean that
[01:28:51] you can't become that no it just means
[01:28:53] that it's too painful for most people to
[01:28:55] go through so very few people ever get
[01:28:57] there so if you look at the actual
[01:28:58] results he would be correct
[01:29:00] but he's not correct because he doesn't
[01:29:02] take the shovel exactly that's not the
[01:29:05] more the story does not some easy
[01:29:07] lit up streetlights right half with nice
[01:29:09] smooth roads right it's a difficult
[01:29:12] [ __ ] where you're gonna fail and
[01:29:14] you're gonna be in your head you could
[01:29:16] be saying I'm not good enough and it's
[01:29:18] how you get through that is how you get
[01:29:20] through that on a daily basis when that
[01:29:22] thing is say man I'm 43 I've done so
[01:29:26] much you start to become civilized the
[01:29:29] refrigerator gets full you start getting
[01:29:31] making money and you start I'm not
[01:29:34] getting cold anymore I'm retired what's
[01:29:36] in at forty people shouldn't be playing
[01:29:39] basketball or football or beating them
[01:29:42] up you start to believe this [ __ ] and it
[01:29:44] becomes in your [ __ ] mind like there's
[01:29:46] people who are retiring you know at
[01:29:47] 40-something years or 37 years old at 43
[01:29:50] I'm still putting a hundred-mile weeks
[01:29:52] still doing thousands of pull-ups
[01:29:54] thousands of push-ups because I'm not
[01:29:56] allowing myself to become civilized the
[01:29:59] worst didn't happen to a man's become
[01:30:00] civilized you lose that [ __ ] fight you
[01:30:03] you you you lose that why the [ __ ] am i
[01:30:05] doing this [ __ ] I'm good you ain't good
[01:30:08] man you ain't never [ __ ] arrived and
[01:30:11] that's just my mentality you may have
[01:30:13] more but you'd never [ __ ] arrive you
[01:30:15] want to be uncommon a most uncommon
[01:30:16] people period uncommon amongst uncommon
[01:30:21] people is one of the greatest ways to
[01:30:22] put it that's it like if you're if
[01:30:24] you're like for me what got me in
[01:30:27] trouble with the Navy SEALs is I want to
[01:30:29] be one so bad so bad I fought my ass off
[01:30:33] yeah I saw them as uncommon people very
[01:30:36] uncommon but once you become a Navy SEAL
[01:30:38] you're all Navy SEALs so guess what
[01:30:40] happens your [ __ ] common again I
[01:30:42] wanted to be uncommon amongst uncommon
[01:30:46] people I want it to be the guy I don't
[01:30:48] care if you [ __ ] like knock if you
[01:30:50] understand me I didn't give a [ __ ] once
[01:30:52] I went through this [ __ ] journeys
[01:30:53] path of life you ain't got in a whole
[01:30:55] bunch of [ __ ] guys that don't [ __ ]
[01:30:57] like me I don't give a [ __ ] I'm a
[01:30:59] warrior
[01:31:00] period who's like I've been a lot more
[01:31:02] combat to me a Warriors not always that
[01:31:05] words a [ __ ] who says hey I'm
[01:31:09] here again today I'm here again tomorrow
[01:31:11] gonna be here the next day I'm 50 years
[01:31:13] old I'm still [ __ ] getting after it
[01:31:15] it's a person that puts no [ __ ] limit
[01:31:17] on what's possible and that's what got
[01:31:20] me in trouble like that's why I went to
[01:31:21] Ranger School as a seal that's why I try
[01:31:23] to go to Delta Force twice you know I
[01:31:24] bet I've been through all these
[01:31:26] different training programs cuz I was
[01:31:28] looking for in the military what I saw
[01:31:31] is in the training these people get
[01:31:34] their ass handed to him after they get
[01:31:36] out a lot of them get civilized I always
[01:31:40] wanted to go back in the training and I
[01:31:42] we were always I want to go back to war
[01:31:44] in the war was in that training program
[01:31:46] where you see guys you can quit guys who
[01:31:48] are brutal guys who are suffering guys
[01:31:50] who are you go so as a seal you don't
[01:31:52] volunteer for Ranger school I did I put
[01:31:55] in seven chicks got turned down I get
[01:31:57] you know got accepted I went at 28 29
[01:32:00] years old and they go why did you go
[01:32:03] because I started becoming civilized I
[01:32:05] started becoming complacent I I needed
[01:32:08] to get my [ __ ] ass kicked again and
[01:32:10] when you go as a seal going down to it
[01:32:12] you have no rank and Ranger school you
[01:32:14] could be a major you're just [ __ ] Joe
[01:32:16] Brown you're nobody and you're not
[01:32:19] eating you're not sleeping so I always
[01:32:21] would put myself I would immerse myself
[01:32:23] and [ __ ] like that even IRA climb the
[01:32:25] ladder and I intentionally fall back
[01:32:28] down that [ __ ] to say all right
[01:32:29] man getting soft dude getting soft kick
[01:32:33] your [ __ ] ass again and I you know
[01:32:36] it's kind of process did you find
[01:32:38] resistance from that amongst other guys
[01:32:40] that didn't like to make that you were
[01:32:42] making them uncomfortable because that
[01:32:44] is something that people there's a
[01:32:46] natural instinct that people have when
[01:32:48] someone's working harder than them to
[01:32:49] somehow another diminish that person
[01:32:51] well I know that a lot of guys don't
[01:32:53] like me for a lot of reasons and I
[01:32:55] realize that I am a guy that doesn't
[01:32:57] care if you like me or not and when
[01:32:59] you're an alpha male and you're against
[01:33:01] other alpha males and we eat our own
[01:33:04] alpha males eat their own now I love
[01:33:07] that [ __ ] let's [ __ ] go man I want to
[01:33:10] eat a man I'm all about that kind of
[01:33:12] mentality
[01:33:13] but I was sometimes take it to another
[01:33:15] level now I went part of a of a good old
[01:33:17] boy network I don't wanna be part I want
[01:33:19] to be David [ __ ] gaga for too long in
[01:33:22] my life and it got me in trouble for
[01:33:24] time I left I wanted to be accepted
[01:33:26] growing up
[01:33:27] I lied I [ __ ] did what I could for if
[01:33:30] you [ __ ] like UFC and I didn't I love
[01:33:33] it I love it man let's go [ __ ] watch
[01:33:35] me be my friend be my buddy
[01:33:36] that [ __ ] weak-ass [ __ ] I found out

[01:33:42] Gaga's Who am I so going through all I
[01:33:46] did it alone
[01:33:47] there was no [ __ ] trophy on the
[01:33:49] [ __ ] wall on the mantel that trophy
[01:33:50] is my [ __ ] brain no one helped me get
[01:33:53] you know I pay my [ __ ] bills no one
[01:33:54] did [ __ ] for me no one ran those [ __ ]
[01:33:56] miles lost that [ __ ] weight with the
[01:33:57] hood

[01:33:59] man who said Who I am a very competitive
[01:34:03] ultra competitive do that take it what
[01:34:06] you want man I call that personal
[01:34:08] sovereignty exactly who's not a lot of
[01:34:10] people that have that that's me and
[01:34:12] there's a lot of people that change who
[01:34:14] they are depending upon what people want
[01:34:16] from them and that's that's me yeah
[01:34:18] that's important man most people
[01:34:20] struggle their whole life to find out

[01:36:14] say [ __ ] it's a is letting you know what
[01:36:18] I'm thinking if I try to make it all
[01:36:20] pretty and [ __ ] that's not what my life
[01:36:22] was it was a violent violent struggle

[01:36:30] gonna water it down like a watered down
[01:36:32] [ __ ] wasn't fun ain't fun today
[01:36:34] I'm happy don't you think that your
[01:36:39] happiness is probably elevated by the
[01:36:42] amount of pain that you've gone through
[01:36:45] a hundred percent so the amount of
[01:36:46] suffering that you understand the amount
[01:36:48] of pain that you've gone through makes
[01:36:50] you appreciate the happiness and the
[01:36:52] beautiful moments with much more
[01:36:54] intensity that's what weak people miss
[01:36:56] about my story weak people hear this
[01:36:59] soft kid I'm a guy he must be miserable
[01:37:00] oh my god what the hell is wrong with
[01:37:02] them you're missing the [ __ ] story
[01:37:04] you're not listening to the story man
[01:37:07] look what I overcame if that doesn't put
[01:37:11] some badge of honor tattooed in your
[01:37:13] [ __ ] brain for the rest of your life
[01:37:14] you can die today talking to Joe Rogan
[01:37:17] you're missing the story man am I happy
[01:37:21] what the [ __ ] do you think don't miss it
[01:37:23] don't misunderstand the past and wish I
[01:37:25] speak for not being intensely happy
[01:37:27] happiest person in the world but I'm not
[01:37:31] done
[01:37:32] so not gonna speak to you like oh man
[01:37:34] everything is great no I have a lot more
[01:37:36] [ __ ] to do a lot more [ __ ] to do well
[01:37:40] this is in the same use of the word that
[01:37:42] you used the Warriors mentality the
[01:37:44] Warriors life right this is this is the
[01:37:47] way that you can keep balanced and sane
[01:37:50] right and and keep a good grip on who
[01:37:53] you are period and like there's a quote
[01:37:56] that was said I don't know who said it
[01:37:57] but was a great quote this guy said
[01:38:00] going into combat going into war out of
[01:38:03] the hundred men that going to war
[01:38:05] tension you [ __ ] be there eighty of
[01:38:08] them are this target's ten do most of or
[01:38:12] nine do most of fighting one is a
[01:38:14] warrior and it's a true quote to life I
[01:38:19] saw it going through train I saw it
[01:38:21] everywhere I went
[01:38:22] there's so many people who just show up
[01:38:24] to life that shouldn't even [ __ ] be
[01:38:27] around and there's a few people who do
[01:38:29] all the work I wanted to be part of that
[01:38:31] nine and I'm working towards being that
[01:38:34] one and that's how I live my life now
[01:38:37] what are you doing with your life these
[01:38:38] days right now I keep the same I'm very
[01:38:42] routine I get every morning I run I go
[01:38:45] to the gym and then at nighttime I
[01:38:47] stretch out I am a mom just trying to
[01:38:49] develop a business costing me a lot of
[01:38:52] money trying to do that I'm just getting
[01:38:53] out I'm an introvert so I never want to
[01:38:56] get on social media I'm not big on that
[01:38:59] I'm big on being with yourself
[01:39:02] I believe all these [ __ ] cameras and
[01:39:06] phones and [ __ ] it takes you away from
[01:39:08] the most powerful thing in the world
[01:39:10] which is your [ __ ] mind so I try hard
[01:39:13] to continue to grow that I'm trying to
[01:39:15] break a record again I'm trying to cross
[01:39:17] Death Valley as fast as possible top of
[01:39:19] Mount Whitney and I'm constantly trying
[01:39:21] to put goals and for me but the biggest
[01:39:23] thing is I'm trying to find more of
[01:39:24] myself and the only way I can find more
[01:39:26] is to silence the world out as much as I
[01:39:28] can because it's getting busier every
[01:39:30] day it's getting faster and the faster
[01:39:33] it gets the more you are missing who the
[01:39:36] [ __ ] you are so I trapped my own mind a
[01:39:39] lot and said look man I put my phone
[01:39:40] away I'll put [ __ ] away and I go dark I
[01:39:43] go dark a lot and it's
[01:39:45] because I have to find out I'm on a
[01:39:46] journey of life and we all have a
[01:39:48] different journey and I want to be in my
[01:39:50] [ __ ] pine box and I believe your
[01:39:53] spirit lives forever has too it's too
[01:39:54] [ __ ] powerful no way in hell that
[01:39:57] thing that's dies when you die I want to
[01:39:59] be able to look back on my life and I'm
[01:40:01] all dead and be so [ __ ] proud of
[01:40:02] myself forever this is all temporary
[01:40:05] [ __ ] to me I want to be forever proud of
[01:40:08] who I was as a man and change who I used
[01:40:11] to be the liar the insecure guy the guy
[01:40:14] who can whatever I want to be proud but
[01:40:16] if I died now if I die at 84 diet 9800 I
[01:40:19] want to look at myself as a proud of
[01:40:20] myself don't you think that also like we
[01:40:23] were saying that because you've gone
[01:40:25] through so much struggle you appreciate
[01:40:27] happiness true happiness do you think
[01:40:29] that you appreciate discipline because
[01:40:31] you weren't discipline do you think you
[01:40:32] appreciate the hard work you put in
[01:40:34] because you used to be weak yes I
[01:40:36] appreciate self-discipline yes I never
[01:40:38] had a crazy thing about what you know
[01:40:40] you say that I have a [ __ ] can
[01:40:42] wake me up at 3 o'clock in the [ __ ]
[01:40:45] morning and say hey you gotta get your
[01:40:46] [ __ ] in I had no trainer I have a
[01:40:48] nutritionist it was the self-discipline
[01:40:51] that I had to survive not survive I was
[01:40:54] weak to thrive no one say man you're 297
[01:40:59] pounds man
[01:41:00] I wanna help you out I mean you're
[01:41:03] [ __ ] you're not smart I'm gonna help
[01:41:06] you out I had to work at all this [ __ ] I
[01:41:09] had to overcome and and it self
[01:41:14] discipline is everything if you don't
[01:41:16] have it I don't look at you right now I
[01:41:18] know you're capable of more it's not
[01:41:20] discipline so much for me it's all on
[01:41:22] you it's all on you the self part it was
[01:41:27] big we need someone to hold people
[01:41:29] accountable [ __ ] that [ __ ] man
[01:41:32] [ __ ] that [ __ ] we we count on people too
[01:41:35] much to get us through [ __ ] and we look
[01:41:38] to our right we look to our left we're
[01:41:39] looking for help and if you can build
[01:41:41] that self you can build that total
[01:41:44] accountability in oneself and it's not
[01:41:47] about being selfish I'm trying to create
[01:41:49] a better me so hopefully people who are
[01:41:51] hearing this are taking it the right way
[01:41:53] can say I can run a mile anybody run a
[01:41:57] 205 [ __ ] mile doing for
[01:41:58] Venis it ain't bout all that [ __ ] she
[01:42:00] doesn't matter I want you to see how
[01:42:03] [ __ ] far you can go and that's all
[01:42:05] it's about yourself and that's where it
[01:42:08] all comes from Willis and I guarantee
[01:42:10] you've already done that
[01:42:11] what you experienced from watching that
[01:42:13] television show and with what got you
[01:42:15] out the door what got you to sort of
[01:42:18] take the first steps to change your life
[01:42:20] will you experience by watching rocky
[01:42:22] what you experience of inspiration those
[01:42:26] are critical for people they need to
[01:42:27] know that someone's done something that
[01:42:29] someone's done something that's greater
[01:42:30] than they what they could imagine
[01:42:32] themselves doing and they want to take a
[01:42:33] step towards trying to be better that
[01:42:37] inspiration is gigantic and sometimes it
[01:42:40] comes across as corny you know people
[01:42:42] read it too much of it online it becomes
[01:42:45] it drowns out you lose that the meaning
[01:42:48] gets lost I mean there's and there's a
[01:42:50] lot of posers because a lot of people
[01:42:52] are out there that are there pretending
[01:42:54] that they're trying to offer up
[01:42:55] inspiration or a true honest account of
[01:42:58] their experiences but really what
[01:43:00] they're trying to do is say something
[01:43:01] that's gonna get likes right you know
[01:43:03] they're trying to say things that they
[01:43:05] think people are gonna go yeah double
[01:43:07] high five right you know there's a thing
[01:43:09] that people are doing when they're just

[01:44:27] anything I'm not I'm not gifted

[01:44:32] trying to share that message with people
[01:44:34] this is all about you know I speak to a
[01:44:37] lot of people and that's what that's
[01:44:40] what I do now and how are you doing it
[01:44:41] as a business I do something more of a
[01:44:43] tional speaking but you know right now
[01:44:45] I'm not really try making a lot of
[01:44:47] [ __ ] money I'm just trying to build
[01:44:48] the brand I was authentic as possible
[01:44:50] because I don't want to build it too
[01:44:52] fast because my biggest fear in life is
[01:44:55] people can rewrite through a
[01:44:56] [ __ ] that's not real I do it all
[01:44:59] the time
[01:44:59] like a lot of people have these great
[01:45:01] quotes and they and they mass produce
[01:45:03] I can't mass-produce something man Brian
[01:45:07] and they and they had these great quotes
[01:45:08] and [ __ ] but are you living that
[01:45:10] [ __ ]
[01:45:10] which you dis quoted in how powerful it
[01:45:13] may sound are you getting up every
[01:45:16] [ __ ] morning and I'm not working out
[01:45:17] whatever are you really getting the [ __ ]
[01:45:19] after are you just talking to motivate
[01:45:21] people right and I don't want to be that
[01:45:23] guy who are you talking to pretend that
[01:45:25] you're exactly after and I people make
[01:45:27] this big money over here the side which
[01:45:28] Robin made a lot and they they talk this
[01:45:31] [ __ ] and they're off this until it's
[01:45:34] gone right and all Finnick a tall man
[01:45:36] you know it's all this [ __ ] right and I
[01:45:39] read it on my mask and [ __ ] right
[01:45:41] [ __ ] man [ __ ] wake up get after
[01:45:44] it live what you're saying and then it
[01:45:46] comes people can see when I talk the
[01:45:48] reason I talk so [ __ ] just passionate
[01:45:51] cuz I'm reliving my [ __ ] life I'm
[01:45:54] reliving this morning when I got up I
[01:45:56] want to do that [ __ ] I'm reliving
[01:45:58] everything I did it and I can't speak to
[01:46:00] you like all calm and [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks it
[01:46:03] sucks man so whenever I start talking
[01:46:05] about like after this podcast you'll see
[01:46:06] man
[01:46:07] god you're so calm right now what the
[01:46:09] [ __ ] is wrong with you I'm not going
[01:46:12] back through that [ __ ] man I'm not I'm
[01:46:13] not going back through the the suffering
[01:46:15] and [ __ ] that it took to become Who I am
[01:46:16] today some story so I built this brand
[01:46:18] to the point where I can slowly
[01:46:20] hopefully make people from motivated to
[01:46:23] driven because motivation is crap
[01:46:25] [ __ ] people right now maybe listen to
[01:46:27] this [ __ ] they'll be motivated to go run
[01:46:29] if it's closed somewhere where they're
[01:46:31] at a lot of my first we'll shut that
[01:46:32] door go back inside that's motivation it
[01:46:35] comes and go as how you feel if you and
[01:46:38] your wife are good if you and your kids
[01:46:40] are good if you're good at work you're
[01:46:42] motivated
[01:46:43] I like the [ __ ] whose life is
[01:46:45] imploded ain't got [ __ ] in life and says
[01:46:49] I still got [ __ ] good after today man
[01:46:52] it's what it's about so that's when you
[01:46:54] move from motivation to driven to
[01:46:56] obsessed and I want people to realize
[01:46:58] once you get to this portion of over
[01:47:00] here the driven obsessed part your
[01:47:02] stoppable this commitment that you have
[01:47:04] to authenticity is one of the reasons
[01:47:06] why people are connected to what you've
[01:47:08] met your messages that's one of the
[01:47:10] reasons why what you're saying you don't
[01:47:12] want to grow it too fast you don't want
[01:47:14] it to be [ __ ] you're terrified of
[01:47:15] that thing just like we were talking
[01:47:16] about with weak people you terrified a
[01:47:18] scene that weakness in yourself right
[01:47:20] you know we all see that we've all seen
[01:47:23] motivational things that are [ __ ]
[01:47:25] we've all talked to people that are
[01:47:26] talking and you realize there's nothing
[01:47:28] really that they're connected to they're
[01:47:31] not really connected to their words
[01:47:32] their words just a bunch of words
[01:47:33] they've pieced together because they
[01:47:35] sound like something that someone who's
[01:47:36] you know enlightened on the subject
[01:47:39] would say right yeah it doesn't it
[01:47:42] doesn't it doesn't connect at all so
[01:47:44] your struggle now is to try to figure
[01:47:46] out how to stay you and get the message
[01:47:49] out but still be fully connected to that
[01:47:51] message right that's you know it's not
[01:47:53] so much a struggle because I'm not
[01:47:56] really about I'm not driven by the
[01:48:01] business I'm not I'm not doing by trying
[01:48:03] to be I I make a very small salary from
[01:48:06] being retired from the military that's
[01:48:08] all I need so I'm not fast - I'm a
[01:48:11] minimalist [ __ ]
[01:48:12] give me a backpack of [ __ ] ground and
[01:48:15] sleep on and a pull-up bar and a [ __ ]
[01:48:17] some running shoes and a Subway sandwich
[01:48:20] with some [ __ ] and I'm [ __ ] straight
[01:48:21] so it's um I believe in patience I'm a
[01:48:26] patient dude I can watch the piece of
[01:48:28] grass grow for 20 years because I know
[01:48:31] that this is how you get somewhere in
[01:48:34] life by being that monk-like mentality
[01:48:38] and being able to watch something grow
[01:48:40] very calmly patiently and that's all I'm
[01:48:43] doing right now about monies and about
[01:48:45] people knowing me I'll keep you like me
[01:48:46] whoever wants to hear this is out there
[01:48:49] so so your your goal is to grow this
[01:48:52] right slowly very slowly and your goal
[01:48:56] is to grow this in order to impact
[01:48:58] people period that's it it's not about
[01:49:01] me what do you get out of impacting
[01:49:04] people it's a good question I don't I
[01:49:08] don't get anything out of it I'm a tool
[01:49:11] but you must get something there must be
[01:49:13] personal satisfaction must be a
[01:49:15] connection to those people there must be
[01:49:17] it must be enriching to you it's hard to
[01:49:19] connect with people because there's
[01:49:20] quite a few now that are coming in right
[01:49:22] it's my duty it's my duty to share my
[01:49:27] it's kind like it's somebody who
[01:49:30] discovered a new earth you know and
[01:49:33] discover the people on it that in the
[01:49:35] water source and the food source I
[01:49:37] discovered a whole nother part of your
[01:49:40] [ __ ] brain that a lot of people don't
[01:49:43] even know about it's my job by being the
[01:49:46] [ __ ] on this journey and being a
[01:49:47] discovery person being the person that
[01:49:49] maybe I discovered this part I
[01:49:52] discovered a very important part that I
[01:49:53] haven't met many people that have
[01:49:55] discovered this part I'm sure there's a
[01:49:58] lot out there but it's my job now take
[01:50:00] these weak people in the category that I
[01:50:02] was in and say uh-uh
[01:50:05] stop reading the [ __ ] stop listening
[01:50:07] to the [ __ ] and if my story of
[01:50:11] success can impact somebody it is my job
[01:50:13] is my duty to share this too as much as
[01:50:15] I'm not really fond of it I I'm the kind
[01:50:19] of guy that wants to sit in the [ __ ]
[01:50:20] room and just be me just be me alone by
[01:50:24] myself that's who I am I have to get
[01:50:27] uncomfortable and tell people all this
[01:50:30] [ __ ] you think it feels good tell me
[01:50:31] about it I'm a fourth grade reading
[01:50:33] level in high school I stuttered
[01:50:35] I lied to people to be their [ __ ]
[01:50:37] friends I didn't feel good it doesn't
[01:50:40] feel good at all
[01:50:41] but maybe someone's doing the same [ __ ]
[01:50:44] and maybe they can realize wow that
[01:50:47] [ __ ] was a piece of [ __ ] and he
[01:50:49] [ __ ] now is a Navy SEAL
[01:50:52] tired guy and Rosie's miles and was 297
[01:50:55] pounds and pathetic [ __ ] and Wow
[01:50:59] if he would say why are you talking so
[01:51:00] it's the [ __ ] truth I was a [ __ ]
[01:51:03] pathetic [ __ ] man people cannot
[01:51:06] say that to themselves it's we have to
[01:51:08] choose these great [ __ ] magical words
[01:51:10] that that makes that make people feel
[01:51:12] good tell yourself the truth if
[01:51:15] something - cause you're [ __ ] fat
[01:51:17] they may be bullying you but you might
[01:51:20] be [ __ ] fat someone calls you dumb
[01:51:23] it's me but you might be [ __ ] dumb
[01:51:26] its life man take it for what it's worth
[01:51:29] and change it and that terrible feeling
[01:51:32] when someone does tell you they have fat
[01:51:34] you can use that as fuel period and
[01:51:37] that's all this is about and where it
[01:51:40] goes if it goes somewhere and whatever
[01:51:43] you know I don't give a [ __ ]
[01:51:46] well you said something that I think of
[01:51:48] when I run and it's that most people
[01:51:50] quit at 40% I said that's not 40% rule
[01:51:52] man I love that about 40% rule man and I
[01:51:55] am I really developed that through my
[01:51:58] heart surgeries and I developed that
[01:51:59] through that first hunch at my run is I
[01:52:02] thought I had given 100% the house on
[01:52:04] that chair at Mile 70 I was [ __ ] up I
[01:52:06] thought I'd given 100% and to go that
[01:52:09] last I go man
[01:52:10] there had this I wasn't even near 100%
[01:52:14] so I came up with this thing called the
[01:52:17] 40% rule it's basically where you it's
[01:52:20] like a car you put a governor on a car
[01:52:22] and they said the car can go 130 that
[01:52:25] governor stops the car at 91
[01:52:27] and you're driving thinking man I want
[01:52:29] to [ __ ] Florida but I can't go I
[01:52:30] can't go any faster
[01:52:31] we do it to a brain we put a governor
[01:52:33] brain second we feel pain discomfort
[01:52:36] suffering all those words that we hate
[01:52:38] to say cuz we in this happy peaceful
[01:52:40] world we live in now we stop we slow
[01:52:44] down and if you can get through these
[01:52:46] different barriers and gain five percent
[01:52:48] 2% 3% that 40% becomes 60 that's 60 per
[01:52:52] kid kind of 70 and 80 and 90 and then
[01:52:55] you're hopefully one day near a hundred
[01:52:57] I don't I don't know many people who
[01:52:59] probably add a hundred I mean we think
[01:53:00] we're there but there's so much more it
[01:53:01] isn't a hundred at death's door though
[01:53:03] I love that I think it's true I think
[01:53:06] that's 100% true I think when you were
[01:53:08] laying in that tub you'd knocked on a
[01:53:10] door that is that is a hundred percent
[01:53:12] true no one has ever if that is our
[01:53:14] position I didn't give a hundred percent
[01:53:16] in that 101 mile run I did for the first
[01:53:18] time so that's the scary thing that's
[01:53:21] the scariest thing in the world I didn't
[01:53:23] die you probably gave 99.99999 man dude
[01:53:34] I don't know how to end this any better
[01:53:35] than that so let's just wrap this up if
[01:53:38] people want to find your stuff
[01:53:40] what's the best place to go and look for
[01:53:43] it

## Plain Text (for processing)

five four three two one boom and we're live thanks for doing this man I appreciate it hey thank you for having me I appreciate that he's the only guy I've ever had in the studio where when I showed up you were working out that's what I do mask my life that's my life it's pretty crazy though I mean how much time did you have when you got here I got here about an hour early oh yeah okay so I got here shirt off doing chin up hilarious I think if I camera out in time for you song I wanted to take some pictures well maybe next time next time well catch you after the show you are a guide that for a lot of people you sort of embody the idea of hardening your mind and figuring out a way to do things that most people think are impossible all right let's you've sort of become that guy over your life and you've become that guy for a lot of people including me online we've talked about you on the podcast a ton of times so having you in here has been it's very exciting to me I appreciate that thank you how'd you become that guy you know what I grew up not that guy yeah so a lot of people put a title on me they want to they see me now they see me now as the guy that with his shirt off who can do 4030 pull-ups in 17 hours you can run tours in five miles in 39 hours who can do all this crazy [ __ ] but what they don't understand is they don't understand the journey that it took me to get to this point and what got me to this point was I was just the opposite everything the day I was that guy who ran away from absolutely everything that I got in front of me but not many people knew that I had two people at the like the real me was like this very scared insecure stuttering got beat up by his dad all this kind of stuff and I built this fake person that walked around like my [ __ ] didn't stink you know you know that yeah so that was that's kind of how I did it and I do the process of time I realized that I was lying to myself and lying to people but that it's a fascinating journey though because you are that guy now Ryan you genuinely are legit badass right at one point in time you were a legit terrified person yes so what was the process like how did how did you step forth well it's a it's a long process right um I my dad beat the [ __ ] I mean was growing up we I was the first black baby born in this hospital called Millard Fillmore in Buffalo New York my dad owned skating rinks he owned bars he ran prostitutes from Canada to Buffalo New York my dad was a big-time pimp big-time anything bad about a person big-time hustler he was American you know that I'm with them Denzel Washington he was that but not that bad right yeah he wasn't that big but that's what it reminds me of he was that kind of guy and beat the [ __ ] out of me did she help you no I love my mom there was an instant one time when my mom got knocked out on top of stairs and they drug her down the stairs by her hair at six years old I'll never forget this in my mind I was always afraid my whole life I was afraid but I had this [ __ ] voice this this conscience that would always be battling me said hey you got to get up and do something I didn't want to do [ __ ] you know I was just afraid but I would that that voice would forced me to get up and my dad you know I try to beat him up whatever at six and I get my ass kicked so this went on for several years and I have a big time learning disability can my dad didn't believe in us going to school so my dad it was about the business the skating rink in the bar so this game you open about seven o'clock at night and this is when time I was able to walk so about five you know four or five six years old eight nine and I go to the skating rink it's ten o'clock at night and I worked the skating rink until 10:00 at night and then we would scrape the gum off the floors and we cleaned the whole skating rink up and then my dad at the office and my brother and myself asleep in the office and my mama go upstairs and worked the bar until three o'clock in the morning and then they cleaned the bar up so after all that [ __ ] was done with going to school really happened so when I went to school I was all kind of you know my learning disability I had social anxiety I was just a jacked up kid from living in this tour at home from the outside looking in we live in the all-white neighborhood and then we would travel to the ghetto of Buffalo New York with the skating rink was that so we you know we worked around mostly blacks and I lived around mostly White's but no one knew what was going on the house that on 201 Paradise Road yeah it's crazy but um my mom got courage to finally leave him when I was by 8 years old we moved to a small town in Brazil Indiana and that's when the real war started for me and Brazilian is a small town great people a lot of great people and I say that because like people get offended and I'm gonna get to the point where they get offended there was about maybe 10 black families at about 10,000 people in the town and in 1995 the KKK marched in the 4th of July parade so this was a not every bar was racist there's a lot of good people some the best people I knew was there but there's also a lot of racism there so me being one of the few black kids net you know in the area you know it kind of haunts you I had stuff on my notebook you know [ __ ] we're gonna kill you on my Spanish notebook they had that on my car [ __ ] this is early 90s and so even though I sold it didn't hurt me it was jacking me up so all the insecurities I have when I was a kid with my father I moved into this area here and it just got worse and worse and worse and it [ __ ] haunted me and that voice that talked about it kept talking louder and louder and louder I was doing nothing about it and I decided to make moves and I cheated all through school and it's kind of humbling to talk with my stories sometimes in this um it's also embarrassing but it's real it's who the [ __ ] I am is what I am is what created me and copy from the fourth grade to the to my junior year in high school on every assignment and I want to get in the military I'm gonna join the airforce and the guy gave me an as vapp test as I could water down SAT and I couldn't copy on it because the guy beside me how to test a test B they got him I write he had test C so I looked the copy on this test and I couldn't copy on so I got like a 20 and I wanted to be an Air Force pararescueman it's guys that jump out of airplanes and save down pilots it's a it's a special operator in the Air Force and my squirt was so horribly low that is we take it again and he said hey I got an 18 the second time even worse I need to get a 50 out of a 99 and so a mom and I for a while we lived in the government subsidized apartments seven dollars a month and also food stamps and we slowly moved up to a $230 a month place but at the time you know we you know pretty poor but um my mom afforded enough money for me to go to see a tutor one one hour a week so for four hours a month it had six months to study from our last test I can only take the best you know the answer to test three times and I studied my ass off and passed it I got in the Air Force and realized there was more things in front of me I was afraid of water terrified the water and I've learned how to swim but what gets everybody in this training in all special ops training is the water confidence where they try to pretty much drowned your ass you know all of our lives we've been breathing and they take that from you and they want to see how comfortable you are in the water and there's a 1% african-americans in Special Operations and I didn't know anything about African like a lot of them are negative buoyant which I am because the bone density I struggled but I'm six weeks into the program there was about 25 guys left of about 150 I was there and I was never I didn't gonna sleep for six weeks of the program and I wanted to quit so badly but I quit everything in my life I copied through school I want to prove people wrong and so here I am in this Air Force program start to get a little more confidence but this water was kicking my ass and six weeks in the program the doctor gave me a blood test and must have sickle-cell sickle cell trait not the anemia but I still killed people but so they pulled me out training for a week and when you go from being very uncomfortable in that water situation and then now you're comfortable and I'm sitting back watching the guys drown I'm not you know I'm not part of the activities anymore for this week I don't want to get back in that damn water again so the fear overcame in all my insecurities for my dad from this small town from everything started coming back and even though no one knew how [ __ ] up I was kind of create this other person tough I live with this [ __ ] all time so mean I wouldn't go back in that water the doctor called me a backup I thought to get like a like a medical kick out of the military so no quitting for me they kicked me out so I can have some pride the doctor said no I'm kidding you know we could put you back in the training and I was like [ __ ] but after a week I'm like you know what I missed one week there's only three weeks left there's a good chance you know I could tough this [ __ ] out and go on but I went back to the CEO and the commanding officer of the program and the sergeant said hey you gotta start from day one because you missed you know that that week of training and I broke I broke I couldn't imagine going back through that again so I made up a lie and I said man there's sickle-cell things really scaring me it was the [ __ ] water it wasn't sickle cell and and I pretty much quit even though they gave me a medical and I quit so um from the age of 19 days of 22 I went into the job called tack pee where you control fast movers behind enemy lines cool job but there's no water I was afraid of water so I've avoided it and I gained 125 pounds in that time frame I went from 175 to almost 300 to 297 was my heaviest and I started finding things that was comfortable and the more things I found comfortable the more uncomfortable my mind was because that voice I was telling you about it always was there I was trying to avoid that conscience I wanted to be left alone from that conscience and it wouldn't leave me alone so I got out of the Air Force and I started working for a job called ecolab respray for cockroaches at 24 and I'm spraying at different staking sheiks Red Lobster whatever from 11 o'clock at night at 7 o'clock in the morning and what changed I came home and watch this Discovery Channel show class 224 I came home from Steak N Shake I sprayed it down last get a big ol large 42 ounce shake walk across the street and get a box of mini doughnuts from 7-eleven you never drive home for 45 minutes this big old fat guy who yeah I worked out but I was fat I didn't run didn't PT I just hit the gym so I'm driving home turn the TV on and what comes on Discovery Channel so and that's what everything changed for me I was taking a shower I walked out heard these guys and I watched the show and it made me reflect big-time on the piece of [ __ ] that I am and I'm exactly what people said I was going to be so so what was on this show that really struck home it was um I saw these guys going into water so I was terrified of it I can't even express have you ever had a big fear and I know a lot of fighters have fears and stuff like that but they get over them but all of us have these fears that you just don't want to [ __ ] face and um I have a lot of them had a lot of them and that's what created the person who's in front of today and we'll get into that but I'm just a scared [ __ ] is what I was and but I was watching these guys going through hell week class 2:24 and these guys ringing the bell quitting dropping their helmet down rolling out a lot of guys is leaving and it made me reflect on my fears my insecurities and I saw real men when I thought were real men who were staying who were overcoming adversity who were overcoming all these different things that I had blamed so many [ __ ] people in my life my dad my mom for not being there when I was 14 years old my my mama's would get remarried to this great guy he got murdered and then I moved back to a small town in Brazil and and I everybody was a blame my learned disability my my skin color you know me being everything and so I sat there for a while and I was like man I gotta [ __ ] I got it no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me no one's gonna [ __ ] come to help me his [ __ ] me against me period and I'm so I had to man up and I said first thing I started doing is facing every [ __ ] fear I have no matter what the [ __ ] it is man and these things would keep me up and that no one people who are here in this [ __ ] day they will never really understand and grasp when you face these things and so many things how they keep you up and haunts you at night I think there's a lot of people out there that know what you're talking about I mean and so that's what it did and I had two options to either be that 300-pound guy who spray for cockroaches and thousand dollars a month and at 24 years old knowing we're not 50 [ __ ] years old I can reflect on this and think about what God never became or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and fail entire succeed so I started calling recruiters up I said we'll be a [ __ ] Navy SEAL and every recruiter so there's a weight and height so they weigh weight and height limit to get in the military and I was 6 foot 1 and to 97 and I had prior service which was a big deal so I called all these recruiters up and all of them said hey how tall are you bla bla they got into conversation and see if I even qualified and by the time I got to my weight phone we were hanging up pretty much like hey you know what call somebody else you know try to get in the reserves so I tried to get in the reserves and I called this guy named Steven salad your recruiter up and he said hey come on in he saw me put me through the weight standard all the sort of stuff and to get into the class I had to get into how to lose 106 pounds in less than 3 months so I was like [ __ ] that I can't do that I grabbed my chocolate milkshake and went back to Ecolab I'm going back to work man this is my life so in this job you look you know you're looking for cockroach she's looking for rodents and stuff like that and this next morning or this next night I went to work and I hit the all-night cockroaches too much I hit the mother lode of cockroaches and this restaurant got full of cockroaches and rodents and everything else and I sat there and said this is my life I said this is my life you are exactly who the [ __ ] that this is it and I said this ain't gonna be it for me so in that restaurant I quit my job left my canister in that restaurant my spray canister got back in my ecolab truck and I went home and I started working out like somebody I was I became the most obsessed person on the planet Earth that was basically I had to invent a guy that didn't exist I had to invent a guy that can take any pain any suffering any kind of judgment be called [ __ ] be called whatever the [ __ ] in the world and be understanding the [ __ ] room and said go [ __ ] yourself I had it built the I had to build this callous mind and I built it to suffering I built it to downright [ __ ] just crushing myself if it was raining outside three o'clock in the [ __ ] morning feeling the first instinct is don't go out there and do [ __ ] my instinct was we gotta [ __ ] go out there anything that was [ __ ] horrible in my life that I would normally say no that was inhumane that most people I had to go do it and I started callous in my mind at this point in my life and I lost the weight I lost the weight and I went back to recruiter I got into that class and I went through three Navy sohail weeks in one year only God ever be in three hell weeks in one year after my knowledge the first one I didn't make it through the next two I did and that I just didn't stop anymore from there and I started realizing through this through this process that the [ __ ] mind is what you created and I started opening different doors that I didn't think we're even there they didn't think even existed and the more doors are opening up the more I start realizing that my potential is damn near endless and it changed my whole mindset so I went from David Goggins and I created Goggins and that journey is a priceless journey that is hard for me to explain to people because it sounds so quick and easy that guy's lost this weight and I went through three healthiest I went to Ranger school went to Delta Force Lexus whatever it is it was brutal it's a brutal journey every [ __ ] day and if ever less what are you happy if anybody knows my life story and I try to give you a just a snippet of it where I'm at two days in front of Joe Rogan telling you my life to get through what I became to get to where I'm at now there's nothing but pride I have for myself that I can't really I can't really show people because I have this face and a space that they see like are you happy what's wrong with you I'm driven I'm obsessed and that's what you see that's it people need to hear this story this is a this is an exciting story for people because there's a lot of people out there that feel trapped and they feel stuck and they feel like they can't do anything this is who they are you're a guy who felt that exact same way but figured out how to not be that person and be a person you would admire how did you what were the first steps like you had some slips before right because you you quit because of the water thing right but then when you went back the second time and you decide you're going to lose all that weight and you quit that job did did you was it just straight forward from there or whether there's some days where you just failed and then you picked it back up again so my first run when I decided to lose the weight I was like I said 297 I was about thirty two percent body fat and I went my idea was to run four miles for my first run I didn't know how bad it's gonna [ __ ] hurt me I used to run before I was fat and I was like [ __ ] it I can do this I ran a quarter mile and walked home I walked home and sat on my couch and cried I miss my mom's house who was about 40 about maybe 20 minutes down the road and cried and getting her couch saying I can't [ __ ] do this I don't know what I'm gonna do I just got somebody pregnant my life was this [ __ ] I was making $1,000 a month my rent was 8/10 a month and my mind just kept [ __ ] with me and kept [ __ ] you're not good enough man this isn't for you man these guys are best mother [ __ ] on the planet Earth you not that and what it was and it's kind of funny I was obsessed with rocky rocky one in particular and when I was a kid I come home every day and I watched his [ __ ] show rocky and I was fast forward with the little VHS tapes to round 14 round 14 [ __ ] me up like nobody's business why this song came on right so when I bought the pull-up record I listened to the song for 17 hours it's two minutes and 13 seconds and I'm able to visualize and dream like nobody's business and I know that I can create a vision that many people can't and I work for it so the vision I had was when Apollo Creed beat the [ __ ] [ __ ] out of Rocky beat the [ __ ] out of him he's kept fighting he was a dumb fighter couldn't read couldn't [ __ ] on me couldn't read couldn't write just punchy everything about him and rocky beaches are probably [ __ ] using that corner everybody was saying stay the [ __ ] down and him getting up him getting up Apollo Creed raised his arms up in the [ __ ] air turn around thought he won the fight he turns around and sees this guy getting up and it was the face of Apollo Creed that changed my life the face of Apollo Creed it was like just by that [ __ ] getting up not winning just by him getting the [ __ ] up Apollo Creed was his champ his best rocky had taken his soul had literally taken his soul his his head goes down he looks down like Ruth what the [ __ ] are you I wanted to be that not Rocky I want to be the guy that people looked at I don't keep you've liked me or didn't like I don't care but said this [ __ ] is gonna keep coming after whatever the [ __ ] is in front of them I wanted that I wanted that I wanted that worse than anything in the world so that is I kept picturing me falling down and getting up and every [ __ ] that called me [ __ ] I was dumped even myself even myself I wanted to feel something besides two feet I wanted to just go to distance and that going a distance pushed me to a point of where now I go way past the distance so you go the first day you run a quarter-mile and you walk back home and you're you're upset how do you how do you move forward so basically idea was I came home and I had a talking milkshake I sat down and I gave up I said it saying go [ __ ] happen Mac I lose 106 pounds and I came and go a quarter a [ __ ] mile I started being able to take negative [ __ ] and be happy and this whole I say what if a lot it sounds corny and it sounds weak but it's true one of the recruiters said there's not many black Navy SEALs in fact I was a thirty six african-american seal in history is in overseas because the [ __ ] water you know I mean people get mad at me it's [ __ ] true just get over it and so I was like man what story would it be if my [ __ ] fat dumb lying to be people insecure ass can overcome this [ __ ] and that would if mentality like that that dreamer mentality just would always fuel me it was just ruin man what if I can be but if I can be a seal man what if I can go from wearing a quarter of [ __ ] mile now I run 205 miles what if I can go but just what if I can go in and what if how would that feel if I'm graduating kind of get at that graduation thing I was talking about 224th like the video I said then I'll watch this command officer stood up and he said to the graduation guys you're graduating buds like eighteen of them he said we live in a society where mediocrities often rewarded and we don't to say something about these men detest mediocrity and I wanted to be a man that the test mediocrity you know it got me a lot of trouble in the SEAL Teams and going forward in my life because I just I started looking down on people for not going hardest [ __ ] [ __ ] and I started to create different things but that's for a different day but I just believe that it you know my whole mind changed that is a problem that a lot of people who work hard to have you get angry at people who don't work hard to the point where you you know you want to insult them you want to you want to smack them and it's really because you're scared of seeing that yourself yeah that's probably the truth that's probably the truth so I guess a lot of times my life I would see people and it part was a direct reflection of who I was and I would get mad at them but reflections probably just be getting mad at myself yeah that's for me 100% when I when I see people they're half-ass some things I get terrified of seeing that in myself and I get mad at them right and it's uh it's not a good way to handle it no you know but it's it's natural because you're just terrified of seeing that trait right and it cost me so you come back mmm you do the quarter-mile right you walk back home how do you regroup so what I did I sat down then I put rocky in I got my milkshake put rocky ice you know what I was big-time in Rocky and platoon why platoon I love to see people who were getting beat down and this there's there's scenes there's scenes that this drove me and people in my hell weeks you know I was in three of them always hear me singing these songs these songs humming these songs in torturous situations when you're when everybody's quitting this [ __ ] code I would be somewhere gone somewhere [ __ ] gone if somewhere [ __ ] darkest [ __ ] there's a scene of platoon when Elias Wimborne and shoots Elias and you know they think Elias is dead and the choppers are taking off and charlie sheen's ask him you know Tom Berenger where's Elias reason lies Willem Dafoe I found him back there dead somewhere and through the woods the Viet Cong has chasing he lies through the woods and the shoot him in his [ __ ] back and all he wants to do is get to the [ __ ] chopper he's getting shot in his back he's getting up getting something face getting up and you see this guy just fighting I love the [ __ ] guy who just [ __ ] fights and so I put these things in as reminders that you're gonna have to [ __ ] suffer man this [ __ ] point two-five man this is man you're gonna have to [ __ ] suffer to go from this fat insecure [ __ ] to one of the best guys on the planet Earth this journeys could take something that is going to be incomprehensible to most people and these different visualizations how I visualized myself talked it became so nasty and dirty that I wasn't liked the fact that I went point to five so it became from being defeated to like man all right [ __ ] maybe you know maybe tomorrow and go point seven-five you know it just became this different mindset I turn negatives into positives so I would I would take it like who would even think about doing this so I would sit in my couch saying who at 297 who can't [ __ ] swim that great who scary the [ __ ] water we have the [ __ ] balls kind of balls to [ __ ] man up quit a job and go and it put everything on himself so it's how I started talking to myself and put myself in a whole different category and that was fueling me the next day and I just kept using that as fuel and fuel no one would do this [ __ ] no one do this [ __ ] you're the best [ __ ] around you're the best [ __ ] ever live and I had the guys kept fueling me with them with the right kind of message that I needed to hear that was never telling myself and through time became reality to myself so you start out on the first day and then do you start running again the second day yeah the second day was right back after again but I start realizing I can't run that for right so what I did was I became damn near a professional cyclist with the miles I put it on the bike so I never we never watched TV I had to be doing something so I was riding the bike I rode a bike a lot to lose the first initial kind of weight cuz it took my bones were just hurting so bad my bow is broken and I learned to get over that also and I tried to swim a lot I weren't a great swimmer but putting fins on kind of equalized my body I wasn't so negative buoyant so I started fitting a whole bunch and I spent hours in the pool hours in the pool trying to get more and more comfortable not because I was going underwater I was so scared of the water that I had to live in the water I had to become one with the water so going to the pool used to scare me so I went to the pool an awful awful lot and then the bike got easier I was able to run more I went from like one mile one mile was a great accomplishment two miles and then from 2 to 3 was a big one I went from 3 to 6 and then like they have a warning order that they give people to get ready for buts and the whole thing was running 6 miles five days a week and that was my goal and so I just kept I failed I go back to scratch I use some positive motivation I have like one day where I like [ __ ] defeated but I started realizing this a part of the process this is a part of the journey I had to realize this is part of my process versus just saying like I used to I'm just not good enough if I'm not good enough we always say that [ __ ] that's not good enough and then we try something else I'm gonna [ __ ] make myself good enough and that became my mentality I'm gonna make myself good enough and so I misunderstood a lot but that's that's all it came down to I made myself good enough and the days I couldn't run that far the next week I would do two a days so on the running if I ran a quarter-mile I weighed a [ __ ] couple hours it haunt me bother me I try to run a half a mile next time same day you can do more than this if I had to walk ahead and walk it just became just a process of grinding and grinding and grandees not even a good word for it it's not even a good word for it and just just going further and further and then when I got through running I go to the bike I go to the pool if I got tired somewhere my legs are tired I go to the gym and I develop this crazy workout where I was doing volume like two-three hundred reps of like very lightweight people I said how you know how come you have any like loose skin my workout routine the gym became sick it became sick I was just doing two three hundred reps four hundred reps on like chest just like for one simple exercise the best press and a racket get back on it just rep it out trying to burn as many calories I can't build that muscle mass and ice became just became obsessed with it so when you're doing this are you worried at all about repetitive stress injuries or the fact that your body's not conditioned for this and you're basically taking your body where you had abused it right and now you're you're forcing it to live like in an elite athlete right I didn't care I didn't know any better I didn't think about it wow I didn't I didn't know that working out that hard would [ __ ] you up I did it [ __ ] you up oh yeah yeah that's one reason I'm with you three Hill weeks so I don't talk about a lot but um the stress of my life getting to 24 calls me have some serious so as issues I know anything about this [ __ ] there's so as muscles what we use history hip flexor muscle and basically under stress it starts to tighten up and I was I started for from the time I was in third grade time I was in seventh grade white blotches on my skin I was just I was in that case and so the insides of me are also getting [ __ ] up so in this process my soul has mostly got real tight to my t12 I can show you the bump on the back of my head after this show is over but I had I started growing this [ __ ] like large tumor or looking bump on the back of my head from my body compressing so I'm six foot one but my muscles were like five foot nine because I just started just the muscle tightness for my so ass going to my t12 I was just getting tighter my quads everything getting tired from just stress just stress in my life so the more I stressed my body with the workouts my lower body became out of balance so I had a bunch of stress fractures bunch of injuries going through buds and how I got through buds was they gave me my third time was my last time going through hell week I basically put a black sock on at four o'clock in the morning and I would get duct-taped I had a numerous stress fractures on both of my legs because my my body was literally like coming in on itself in my legs like I was I was pronating it really bad and putting stress on my stress on my shins and so I would put duct tape I would duct tape my feet and I would show you the top of them where I have pressure ulcers they're the size of quarters from you know how the ankle joint so the foot goes to the shin and how you move this where the tape was so tight it just created a nice ulcer right there and I just uh just kept going through it so you just use that tape to just support your ankles right so I basically cast myself and for the first 30 45 minutes the pain was excruciating but then it would go numb and I would go numb and then I saw I got through Wow did that do any long-term damage oh yeah I've been out for five years so I retired from the I did 21 years in military this time in the Air Force and I did about 16 years in the Navy how old you 43 she looks like you're 30 that's good that's good you really you look very young for your age whenever I'm stressed I get after it I think I fixed was ever bothering me so I basically over the last five years everything I've done in my life I did it be very unhealthy I've never talked about it I just kept going and it cost me pretty much I was choking my insides out adrenal issues tons of general issues thyroid issues anything with the endocrine system pretty much shut down on me a lot my organs were pretty much shutting down and I went from a guy who could run 205 miles to a guy who couldn't get a bed and the doctors were trying to search what was wrong that's why I figure out the psoas muscle no one figured it out and I hit it by accident so I I've missed two days of stretching out in five years and so what happened was all this should I did to myself this dress I under physical mental all kind of [ __ ] it just choked me out from the inside and doctors put me all kind of medication and the medication started doing the exact opposite it was kind of sure I was on um DHEA I was on some different things for my estrogen different things for my I was on anything to do with your with your endocrine system thyroid medicine get God I was on quarters all kind of [ __ ] to get my stuff I'd like just lump in my throat from like the heart was always I couldn't run down the street my body was just jacked up couldn't sleep my hope I was just down shutting down I could give you a lot more than that but just give me example I was [ __ ] dying and so I couldn't do anything I went from a guy who was this guy to a guy who can't do [ __ ] and doctors like I don't know what's wrong with you me you know your labs or this is it PTSD is it what's going on I knew what any of that [ __ ] so I sat in the bed one day and I realized man my life is over this is it but it gave me time to reflect on everything I'd accomplished I've never taken time to reflect on the kid I was to the man I am now so honestly the time I wasn't working out it was the best time I live because I got a chance to really reflect back and be proud of who I became guy never took time to do that it was like one after another get the [ __ ] after get after it get after you ain't good nothing my [ __ ] get after it get after it and I'm I got halted so anyway this process went on for a while more medication this isn't working that's not working no doctor can figure it out I'm like [ __ ] it I saw this doc about eight years before this happened he was like hey man you're so [ __ ] tight I've never seen anybody in my life as tight as you you need 50,000 hours of stretching he's doing some crazy number I like whatever stretching the you know it stretch stress is bad for you so you thought stretch was but that's just bad for you why did you think that I read some article you know a man [ __ ] [ __ ] stretching man I worked out so hard I don't have time to stress man I was 150 miles a week I was biking to work man I was getting after it man I was working a full-time job and stretching and doing that so my body was literally getting tired and tired not just from what I was doing but there's all cuz you ran this nut wasn't that man and so I said no I'm gonna try to stretch out so I don't do anything for like ten minutes or you know I don't do to a six-minute abs [ __ ] so I start stretching out one hour hour and a half long story short man I shaved my head unless every morning and that bump doesn't the back of my [ __ ] head I started realizing it was shrinking for some [ __ ] reason I don't know why because I shaved my head back and I was like it's getting smaller smaller that bump got healthier I got smaller that bump got I was like oh hold up [ __ ] what's going on that so whereas muscle started getting more and more stressed out more more relaxed and over a period of five years I'm the best shape in my damn life right now from stretching out Wow that's all it was I went from like I came in counting medications I was on now I'm on a very low dose thyroid pill period do you ever do yoga all the time man all the time and I if I were to tell somebody one thing right now man that's so as muscle and getting that hip flexor opened up because we're all stressed the [ __ ] out it was it's almost worse than others it changed my life yeah how do you say Nick Gregorius how do you say his last name the Brazilian jiu-jitsu black belt from England the Greek fella he has a great quote about yoga he said yoga is a martial art you do against yourself yep it's a great way of putting it a hundred percent so what it feels like when you're in there right hundred percent and so you how many years ago was this it was five years ago anything and how long was there a period where you couldn't work out at all there was about so I always try to do something but I couldn't run hardly though I could run maybe half a mile and all that hard [ __ ] would happen in my heart would get a fit and I'll cast off what happened and I started just stretching and also I tried to pull ups every now and then but everything was just I didn't have the energy I didn't have anything I mean nothing was processing right for me so do you think that you just broke in your body you pushed it too hard hundred percent sat back in that bed that night and I had a lot of time to reflect us you know what I was actually kind of proud of myself in a very sick twisted way I even though people would understand it I had to do what I had to do and you know and I did it like I didn't tell you how I got into ultrarunning you know there's a lot of things that so I I pushed extremely hard I went way beyond what I thought was capable like my first ultra race I did I was uh I was heavier I was in Iraq you know the marcus luttrell lone survivor I was in buds I was in three hell weeks as you know as I said many times and I knew a lot of guys that died in the operation now I was at freefall school with marking the trail who is his twin brother during the operation wet wings wear market rosin on a survivor I knew market real well and I was about 200 some odd pounds and I didn't run hardly at all at this time I was a seal but I was like a bodybuilder and I did it elliptical trainer 20 minutes on Sunday all I did so I did [ __ ] that cardio stuff I was never about it until this happened so that happened and I was like man I gotta find a way to raise money for these families so I googled the I I found a foundation the Special Operations Warrior Foundation and I googled the 10 hardest races in the world I knew nothing about ultra running the first I'd ever run was 20 miles at one time and so what came up was the bad water 135 135 mile run through Death Valley in the summertime I thought was a [ __ ] stage race I know people can run her 35 miles at one time had no idea was imminent stage race would you run like 20 miles I'll camp out and then run 20 more to get her 35 miles right so I wouldn't alter runner to know ultra runner was I called the race director up Chris Kaufman of the bad water spinning he said are you an ultra runner and I was like I don't know what that is he goes have you run 100 miles in 24 hours or less I was like no but I said I'm a Navy SEAL I was in 3 Heloise I was arranged I gave him some resume he didn't give a [ __ ] he said I don't care you got qualified for my race and the deadline was up in two months for this bad water race and basically he said there's two more races you can do to qualify and I might consider you my race we select top 90 athletes in the world and you know even all true runner but I like your cause like what you're doing he said uh I come up on a Wednesday and he goes there's a race on Saturday in San Diego San Diego one day when you run around a one-mile track for 24 hours Samiha miles you get if you get 100 24 hours I will consider you in my race I did the math 14 some minute mile [ __ ] it I can do that dumb [ __ ] thinking I'll tell you that right now it was rough worst pain I've been in my entire life or this race so I have my wife that time she's not my ex-wife we go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz crackers in my licks that's what I'm gonna have for a hundred mile run so show up at the start line this race it was a you a national championships it's like the best ultra runners compete against each other to Sydney miles you can get in 24 hours and I'm this big bodybuilder looking guy but there's do it like them I would say I was at least 230 at least it may have been more than jacked yeah oh yeah I was ripped to [ __ ] up I'm a big ol chest out date I was I was jacked up there's a picture I mean he definitely didn't look like someone who could run a home run no not at all so basically I start running and I get to about mile 40 mile 50 and I'm feeling pretty good I get to mile 70 and it was the worst pain of my life i sat down this blue lawn chair at Mile 70 and my the rich crackers after mile 20 became wrist cracker bong sky wasn't hydrating correctly I don't know what to do I was drinking mile Plex for my nutrition because I couldn't eat these rich crackers have very minimal water if any at all and I was just dying so I sat down this blue lawn chair as I was watching lies runners go around in this circle and I was all dizzy and lightheaded hadn't gone in the bathroom it's been about 12 hours I went 70 miles about 12 hours which is good and I looked at my ex-wife now and I was like I am [ __ ] I started seeing like three of her and once my body stopped my mind just went off and I had to go to the bathroom and the bathroom is like it's like 20 feet away from me if that not Cooney and so I sat there and pee blood down my leg and start crapping up my back and for 30 miles to go I am my feet were broken I was just in the worst shape because once you stopped running not running like that I mean I didn't run in almost a year I was just doing body building stuff and 20 minutes on the elliptical trainer no running at all I probably ran no [ __ ] no [ __ ] no more than 50 miles the whole year that wasn't my thing I want it to be like jacked you know I didn't want to be cardio guy I want to be ripped big Navy SEAL guy and um in the day before this race is funny this guy named Joe Burns who put me through my hell weeks a SIL guy he's one of the hardest guys out there he was in the gym the Friday before I did this race and he was doing a full body squats deadlifts power cleans I get my own you know he he's a guy that proved me to do this race you know he gave me the approval to go do this race and signed off on it so I'm in the gym I went in there did a full-body hardcore squats deadlifts and everything with this guy because I knew he was gonna come watch me in this race so I've always been about all right man you're gonna see me coming here and Jack this weight and the more you watch me do a hundred mile run we can think about that so basically I paid for it so at my so he came out there with my favorite thing chocolate you know mini doughnuts because he knew my story of my past life and brought the six minute doughnuts out there and I'll have my hat pulled down and at Mile 70 men it was torturous and with blood down my leg and 30 miles to go I started reaching the cookie jars man I started pulling off all kind of stuff I reached in my mind and a lot of us when we have bad times in life even the hardest person where we forget how badass we are during that hard time I have a thing where I take a couple seconds to reflect on I hang on man you've meant to been through this you've been through that you overcame this overcame that I don't ever close my mind to the fact that this can't be done and I knew I had to get up I need nutrition I need hydration I need to get stop being dizzy so that's the first thing I did I didn't panic gonna have 30 more miles to go to get I start about the process slowly but surely I was able to stand up and I was literally hobbling around this track we're just walking no running at all I couldn't run my feet were in the worst pain it's the worst pain I've been in my entire life nothing in any training is even a comparable to this last 30 miles and what happened was my ex-wife looked at me and she's like man you're this we agreed I'm not gonna make the time I was going way too slow and at that time at mile 81 something clicked that I'll never probably be able to do again where my mind body spirit soul everything disconnected and my mind knew I wasn't [ __ ] around anymore it knew it wasn't gonna quit it knew that guy was dead and buried and gone and I was gonna die out here on this [ __ ] Walmart for whatever reason why I was gonna get through this [ __ ] I didn't give a damn it made no there was no [ __ ] crowds there was no trophy at the end there was I wasn't even in a race in my mind there was it was nothing it weren't about nothing there was no nothing it was a bunch of people who didn't know who the [ __ ] I was it was me against me and I used all these different dark places to start bringing out light and just [ __ ] going deeper and deeper in it running the next 20 miles around 101 miles and I ran the next 20 miles ran at about a 1030 pace and I did 101 miles in 18 hours and 56 minutes sat back down that blue port-a-potty now my chair that got from Walmart and that's when the body realized I was done and this great feeling came over me but also the worst pain in my life I that's when I took a humongous [ __ ] on myself literally like I like a [ __ ] log up my [ __ ] back piss so much blood down and my wife was she was a nurse and she was freaked out I couldn't get up I couldn't stand up she backed this Camry on the knoll of the grassy area I was at and we were both lifters at the time so she was decently strong I put my arms around her neck she got me to the backseat of the car that the windows down cos smelled like horrible [ __ ] and I had this poncho line because November in San Diego so I'm sitting there Jack him in the back his car and she was terrified anything dr. Anita that's take me home so we look in the second story or the second deck of this apartment complex in San Diego I got to the first deck so I get a car and I could stand up but with my arms on her neck so just leaning down I was gonna pass out got to the second or I got to the first deck went down just couldn't stand up anymore got around her neck worked up my way up the railing gamma-gamma I was on her neck again walked to the kitchen area which is right in the front door I was laying on a poncho liner crap was everywhere I managed she helped me manage to get into the toilet into the tub and it's like dirt was coming on my penis this looked horrible just just that grossly in the world it was worst pain I can ever ever ever be in in my life and the craziest thing I tell your story because it's right now I'm not sadistic I'm not crazy people may think that any way they may want to put a title on me after hearing me because it makes them feel better because they think wow this guy must be some special or just [ __ ] up crazy dude no I'm a guy that came from nothing anybody's capable of doing [ __ ] like this anybody and I sat in that tub she's put the water on me she called my mom up and my mom was dating a doctor at the time the doctor he actually said you need to get him to a hospital now she came back in all I want to do is call Chris Koster on the phone the race director of bad waters I [ __ ] did it so she some taken to doctor I said no let me sit here enjoy this pain she said what are you talking about I said you don't I go I need to go to the doctor I realize that but I never thought it was humanly possible to do what I did I went 70 miles in at 70 miles I was dead I was at a hundred percent what I thought what I thought was 100% I went 30 I went 31 more miles after being in the worst physical shape I've ever been in in my life and all that all that pain and suffering and thing was going through my [ __ ] body and I sat in that tub and the waters hitting me it was the most amazing feeling of accomplishment and I want to be numb I want people to give me drugs and numbness [ __ ] pain I wanted to I did this however as crazy as it sounds it was the most amazing moment of my entire life to overcome such to come from this kid who was mentally torturing something was torture is talk to this kid - Skyy now who was able to overcome such amazing odds and obstacles and I called Chris cost him up the race director of bad water and he said the idea of a 24-hour race is to run 24 hours you really ran 19 and he put doubt in my mind that he was that mean - bad water so a month later or so about a month and half later I went this race called the hurt 100 so hundred mile race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climb was all he said that's all he said that's so crazy I mean he's a hardcore dude but he didn't know how [ __ ] up I was right and he said he didn't say well you know I can't say no I might let you win he put enough doubt in my mind and say man I got to do more so I was broken I was broken bad and like how long does it take you to recover physically the funniest thing about this I'll tell a story very often I had signed up for I'm getting to that answer it's right now I'm in deployment and me and my wife my mom signed up for the first Las Vegas Marathon down the strip of Las Vegas and that isn't happened so I ran 100 miles before I ran a marathon two weeks later roughly December 5th was this marathon that we all signed up for I couldn't walk I could not walk I was [ __ ] up so it's ten days or two weeks after this 100 mile in one race I did this marathon December 5th Las Vegas I said you know it's the first one I can't run maybe I can walk with my mom so I tried to go out this little Knoll around our grassy area in San Diego I tried to run legs were broken I said [ __ ] I can't even I'm jacked can't do [ __ ] so I said you know what maybe I'll watch you guys do the marathon and I'll cheer you guys on whatever I said I'll try walk with my mom December 5th happened that gun went off 2005 14 days after I broke myself off and I qualified for the Boston Marathon around 308 that's crazy and what's funny about I know people here says [ __ ] even when I tell you the story I dropped I want to drop so many names google it look it up I don't give a [ __ ] like almost seems like I'm making my own story up it does it almost seems like it to you it does I cannot tell it if I were to hear somebody I said let's you know just do you Joe Rogan's podcast I heard some black dude from [ __ ] Brazilian hand talking about I this happened this happened three weeks Ranger school ran a hundred miles broke my feet broke my body I'm like this man he's the biggest [ __ ] liar on the planet or ain't nobody know [ __ ] even why I tell my story it almost sounds like some made-up [ __ ] so yes crazies you ran a hundred miles before you ever ran a marathon right then you didn't run again at all and he's still qualified for the Boston Marathon so you ran a 308 right for the first marathon you ever did ever did two weeks after you ran a hundred miles right with no training and nothing in between but it gets better than that you can see my training log to actually post it up so that's when I started training for the hurt 100 so basically what happened was after that I had about four weeks what did it feel like to run that 308 if you could barely walk when that gun went off something went off in my head and I didn't feel that much pain at all afterwards I did but something happened where I was like the gun went off and that thing came back like all right man what if because I want to qualify for Boston that was my goal but I was I was jacked up you know and I and I and I didn't run as much that sort of at all over my Iraq training I hit the weights and but my job but but my goal was my son that forward a year early I want to qualify for Boston which was a three 10:59 and I was like what if you can qualify for Boston mayor and so we wit helped me out I spent 101 miles what the [ __ ] is 26 miles to me now so the mindset going into it was like I ran 75 more miles in this so I use it to my advantage so after that happened I ran but my feet pretty much broken I would go to the physical therapist and they had this compression tape compressing tape help because I'm my feet were pretty bad off and I would run 7080 hundred mile weeks and then I went to the hurt 100 race in Hawaii 26,000 feet of climbing over 100 miles probably one of the top five hardest hundred mile races in the world I wouldn't even a real runner yeah I baked a lot of miles by the last the last but two and a half about two months but I want a runner went out there and got through the race did in 33 hours with a ninth place finisher not many people finished that that year and I qualified for bad water and got in and I went on to lose weight and train hard and I got fifth my first year I went back my second year and got there when you say you went you lost weight like what were you eventually way in so I went to the race about 190 we lost quite a bit yeah bodybuilding time right that's over a short period of time right how did you lose all that way once again I I just worked out hard I stopped taking my protein so much I got off I was on this stuff called a nitro tech and I got off all the protein stuff I started I stopped hitting the weights so hard and I just became a running fool became the Black Forest got man pretty much pretty simple man that's what happened now when you say you were using compression tape on your feet and that your feet were jacked up what was the extent of the injuries so basically because of my pronation that I never figured out cuz my soul has muscles I always had issues with stretch fractures shin splints so I put a lot of pressure on the inside of my ankles and so that there's this tendon that goes up the backside of your I don't know if it's your fibula my backside that of that little bone backs out your foot it goes right up beside that lot right alongside that bone and that thing was just so fluid up on both sides that even this flexing my foot was just killing me so I when you can you know when you cast that thing up casting my feet always helped me out because it it it locked my foot into a position that wouldn't made me pronate as much so between the casting of that and if you watched the a bad water video of 2006 you see me crossing the finish line with this compression tape literally like flying on my ankles because I went to the race with compression tape on my ankles and so basically I'd have that on my you know on my ankles I had inserts in my you know in my shoes and also this wedge on the back heel of my left foot so then it would keep me from pronating that heel so much so I had all that on just to go around and I ran my ass off and went to bad water 2006 and with compression tape on my feet and walked a lot but I got third place do you always run with regular running shoes I do yeah so now I don't have those issues anymore all the stretching has opened my body up to where I know how it should have been so my alignment is pretty good it's not perfect so now I just run in regular running shoes now no no more compression tape no more none that stuff so if you see now if you look down there you'll see they can press it up and you'll see my ex-wife here in a second taking their compression tape off of me she's doing it right now you see her right now you know she said tape yeah so that's the tape I didn't have to wear every day of my life to run Wow so as you see the story may be kind of unbelievable but there's some proof right there so that's how I was so painful yeah I was pretty [ __ ] up as you see right now me trying to get all man yeah I'm pretty destroyed right there what is the most amount of miles you've ever run at one time yeah two hundred and five and thirty nine hours Wow non-stop whoo yeah I've had quite a few people on I've met quite a few people now over the last year so that have run ultras Courtney doe Walter you know she is she won the Moab okay yeah I heard my 40 rather heard about yes she she beat all the men by 22 miles something like that some crazy things she was first place winner she beat everybody else second place one word and with her I mean you would never believe it wouldn't talk to her she seemed so normal right she drinks beer and eats nachos needs candy ultrarunner man she's just silly and she's fun yep and there's no demon there I like waiting to meet a demon right you know I'm like where's your demon like how are you getting through her demons a quiet demon right it's it's there it has to be okay there's something there has to be there's no other people that everybody I know that that can do that as a demon a lot of us don't want admit to [ __ ] yeah we got him a hundred percent it has to be yeah so when you do this and you you qualify and you do that race in Hawaii right they just let you in after that no so the race in Hawaii yeah I actually called the race jerk threw up and there wasn't like a big time like I had to have 100-mile race I believe as I had and so you know 100-mile you did the boss of merit or you did the Vegas marathon yeah so I did a hundred mile 101 miles the Vegas marathon went to hurt 100 did that hundred mile ER and all this is in a very short amount of time yeah so November was the first time jamala December was the 26 mile or not in Las Vegas January was the next hundred miles on Hawaii you know [ __ ] crazy that is like say if I was your friend and I called you up on October 20th I go hey man how many times you run like run every night I see something crazy I'm gonna pull it up or not but if you can pull my race schedule for 2007 this pull up David Goggins race results you can see something real crazy in a second they saying this is good and I gotta show you proof because why I know my story doesn't make any sense but this look at the dates of these races and we're gonna show it to you in a second it's um just look at the hundred miles and 15 hours back-to-back weekends how many weekends there were between races so if you look right here you can't really see it so he's look at 2007 yeah go all the way down keep on going 2007 steals races there and do that okay get to right there so hundred mile or Hawaii oh gee looked up first two weeks later three weeks later another one that's 50-miler a 50-miler a month later then looking at what 14 days later another 50k 50-miler month later they look at less than a month another 50-miler 53 milder in June July was another 100 miler bad water was literally reached that water was a month after I did that hundred mile or 135 Marlette Ville was less than a month after bad water the plane 100 was three weeks after Leadville Angels crest was to attend date a week after that energy modeler the bare 100 was wet thirteen days after that hundred mile or she and then I ran the two hundred and it said to her and three point five but I didn't ran toward its 205 miles around there but what's not in there was that McNaughton race I did in two thousand or fifty mile race I also did in two thousand seven that wasn't lifted so that was just my 2007 year that's insane yeah so do you think that is what [ __ ] your body up no no no because I I still run the same mileage now well [ __ ] my body up was hell week really oh yeah you don't go through three hell weeks in one year so I so what happened was when I realized that my body is really jacked up was I went I was a big-time squatter loved squatting and I went through the first hell week got messed up ii hope you got all the way through then throw hope we could got all the way through and my third hell we could hit me that guy died on Thursday and then that hell weekend and I graduated pulmonary edema it was a code name was John stop it code is [ __ ] hell week the Pacific Oceans never warm and it rained the whole time the whole time is rain and he pretty much just drown on his own fluid pretty much we were in the pool doing some evolution he sunk to the bottom his temperature was hot he missed a lot of hell week for getting pulled out for different stuff he wouldn't go quit and I'm heating up dying he'll week but um yeah so anyway after hell week ended I want to go back to the gym you know so second phase happened I face like I can get back in the gym so I jacking my weight I love jack and weight and I realized I couldn't squat so I went from squatting a lot to I couldn't even squat the bark and my lower back was all [ __ ] up I was like I don't know what's going on it was cuz this this muscle so inhale week your hip flexors are so and I went through so many of them so fast and so the hardest part of buds I went through three times not not the healthy part yes one the hardest parts but it was the initial part of the where everybody sees on TV the log PT to surf torture the dad gone boats over your head law all that [ __ ] I went through that person three times in one year and over a period of time my hip flexors got so tight that is jacked me up it jacked me up for my hip flexor so so always being so cold and so stressed out and everything led up to it but this really was the part that I noticed I could squat before hell week or before my first time going to buds after after buds I couldn't I couldn't squat anymore do you just think it might just be because your body was exhausted no cuz I for 12 years so I would I would go back and tough it out like like with Joe burns he was squatting so I said [ __ ] I almost caught with Joe burns but I just couldn't squat cuz that that muscle was attached here at t12 so what was it doing - is it locking up it was pulling and so it made my hips feel like I couldn't sink my ass oh I couldn't sink so his incredible pain and then with the weight pushing me down and then trying to push up the pain was just is just too much so so this is all range of motion is always in motion issues yeah Wow that that's an important thing for my friend cam Haynes who doesn't stretch he's another friend of mine who runs ultra races he ran that moab 240 he's run the bigfoot 205 he's run a few of those right um i know he's listening go stretch dude yes support man it was especially if you work in that hard right if you're doing that much yeah you're you're definitely locking up he could barely touch his toes yeah that's not a good thing that's not good no no it comes back to hurt you inside pretty soon now how flexible you now cuz I would imagine you probably a [ __ ] ballerina at this point because sad when your brain I'm trying to get there I'm trying to get there so I stretch every night for at least two hours there's a thing that people said that it always pissed me off like because I'm pretty flexible they said oh you're naturally flexible people have a natural threshold like oh they don't like a doctor told me that I go you don't know what you're talking about I'm like you don't know what you talk about cuz most people don't push themselves past that pain that stretch pain alright people want to put a title on your mask easy for them oh yes exactly natural exactly now you don't work hard enough [ __ ] yeah people built like chimps aren't usually flexible right you have to you have to force yourself to do that's right and I know it because I had a friend my friend Tom our dog nah he was a football player Jack big fick dude terrible flexibility was taking Taekwondo with me and over the course of a couple years I saw that dude eventually develop a full split there you go and he just did it through his mind yes was everybody else was done training that guy would be on the mat constantly stretch and always working out cuz he had built his body up so strong through all those years of squatting and lifting yeah that he just you know he was all tense everything was just like this super powerful right but all like very tense that's why I stopped you know that's why I never stretched because I wanted that strength yeah yeah you want that tight muscle but no I don't think it is stupid yeah I think you're not supposed to stretch before you do big physical activities because I think it does like weaken you somewhat but I don't think being flexible overall makes you weak or not at all yeah what certainly doesn't from martial arts because you need that flexibility to have leg dexterity to be able to kick right it's got to be fluid where it's not tightened up by the restriction of the motion of your body I get it it's truth I just think people are for whatever reason and I'm one of those drone on too much about yoga I'm like one of those vegans it's like you got to do it man right he's trying I get it knowing like a born-again Christian or something I'm getting that way now man that way now for anybody does anything hard like you know if you do anything like with weightlifting type [ __ ] or martial arts type [ __ ] where it's just everything's explosion its lifting it's heavy push push push right yoga just will balance your [ __ ] out yeah well yeah really well man and there's all these people that resist it like there was some article recently that it was something along the lines of hot yoga is just trendy nonsense I've read that and then even in the article it talked about that there might be some benefits in terms of like the strengthening your arteries and they didn't even mention heat-shock proteins is a study going on right now I believe it's at Harvard one of my friends was telling me about it where they're they're trying to find the benefits of 90 minute hot yoga classes because they think it might mirror the observed benefits of sauna which they already know for a fact has big benefits because of your body producing heat shock proteins to deal with the heat right that's why I put that sauna in here man I go in that [ __ ] all the time well no one can tell me doesn't work that's big it's proof positive you changed my life it wasn't a medication or this or a dress it was stretching yeah it was yoga stretching all that stuff combined changed it well I just think it balances out your body in those static poses where you're just holding the pose and it just it works you out in a weird way that one's a person you just don't get lifting weights or hitting the bag or anything out you're just not gonna get that that kind of working out I can't agree with you more it's so difficult crazy get your ass off and [ __ ] and you're like this is like the silent struggle it's humbling nobody knows it's like if you see like two doorways right and one of them is like [ __ ] CT Ollie Fletcher's [ __ ] super pump iron addicts gym which is hard work and then right next to it is the yoga studio you're like well once you get done with all that hard work you'll go over to that yoga studio no there's two different kinds of hard work going on it's no joke two different kinds of hard work yes sir so what do you do now in terms of like you got over this five years ago you're in this bad situation when your body's not working right now everything's working great again well I had two heart surgeries also whoa yeah so you know your heart so I had a hole in it so you know you're not supposed to have a hole in your heart and be a seal and it reborn with it I was born with it it went undetected and me pushing so hard so around in 2009 I was trying to first race across America and I just couldn't go anymore another pitfall in my life was the hole and I was pretty much off active duty steel for three years yeah you know I had two hearts for them trying to fix it so the hole was significantly large look how big that they say it was as big as a quarter now Mike Holly Hill is it big as a quarter yeah that's a pretty big hole in your heart because they had to helix patches I'm like that's impossible that the helix patches they're in my heart so the two stents what is a helix patch it is like a little mesh very like what they do for hernias like something maybe something like that so they went through my femoral artery and they placed this patch but to go through your artery yeah everything my femoral artery yeah looking with a camera yeah whoa so what no the cameras down through my throat whoa and they put this catheter through my femoral artery get went to my heart they they went and they took this helix patch they place it in there and then they found out six months later that the hole wasn't covered up enough yet because always I mean in the huge patch was very damn big so they put it go back in there in 2010 how does the patch adhere to your heart I guess your heart heals around the patch so but how did they stick it in place I I guess they put it with the holes at uh-huh and then it kind of like inflates oh wow the hole is that and then that that thing goes in there and then it kind of covers a hole and in the heart so there's two things in my heart right now that the heart just kind of covered up whoa okay so there you go Jamie's got an image of it for us whoa so so it's attached to this little probe right and then they put it over the area where the injury is Wow that's insane yeah atrial septum defect if I had atrial septal defect so basically everything I had done I then got from medicine oh [ __ ] you do I'll be done that's so crazy that they could do that yeah so I was out for I was off-duty for three years so I stuck I was in a recruiting area for three years trying to get back on active duty and that was my life for three years so they put that patch in yep and now your heart's 100% 100% it sounds percent Wow yeah that's incredible yeah I was losing you know blood and I was just I was a bad off it's just amazing that you were able to do all that with a hole in your heart that's what the doctors were saying you know because eight naw I was a seal so when I went in and the doctor that found the hole are like so they'd gave me EKGs all this stuff once again may you after I ran like 205 miles you know Ryan made you're in great shape I'm like man I just don't feel good like walking up the stairs this making me jacked up so the doctor doc Shrek he's like you know gave me he can go to the doctor get an echocardiogram so I'm in there getting echocardiogram just chilling out in there and the guys talking to him he has his little wand in my heart we're bullshitting about stuff and he when people get quiet [ __ ] not good man so he's in there this has one of my heart chilling out yeah man we doing yeah you know what's going on now like he says I'll be right back he goes and gets a doctor doctor comes in puts thing I'm a heart the doctor gets another doctor now I'm just freaking the [ __ ] out I'm like okay cuz when it comes to your heart that was a big deal so they come back in they say hey we can stop the echocardiogram I mean he talked you out in the hallway you have a hole in your heart and the guy didn't know that I was he knew I was Navy god I don't think he was a seal because not me black guys are seals and he had a conversation about you know we gotta fix this real quick I said yeah I mean then I came up that I was the seal he said man you could have died jumping you could die diving you could have died into all this stuff cuz basically the hole in your heart if it gets plugged with something like anything like you know let's say you get a bubble from diving or something like that you got died right so I I I call it luck I call it look so I I got through two surgeries they put me back on they give you the first one yeah and when do they realize that it's not done not good enough so they take you back and you get a bubble study a bubble test so it's so they like literally send bubbles that way safe bubbles that way to see if the bubble goes through your heart so they have this this echocardiogram again and they hook you up I think to ID or something like that and they throw these bubbles through your heart and they see if it goes through after six months when I should've been healed up the bubble went through so had to tell me then hey we got a you know you're not you're not good to go so I had to take a year before I have another surgery because because that patch had to be completely completely healed so they can go back in time you knew you had a hole right so so then you add a hole because of the heart surgery probably all this time like when you're waiting for it details you know you have an extra hole yes I don't have a hole yes what were you allowed to do with your body then well at that time they go you know do how you feel comfortable and so you know the hole is not going to kill you right now but you can't die if you can't jump you pretty much wouldn't steal anymore so I was a recruiter for a period of time so basically I was crazy about that is before my second surgery I was actually training for Delta Force I was I wanted to go to Delta and I was rucking ruck running a lot and before my second truck running I mean you're running with a package I pack on my back with some weight on how heavy is the pack 50 60 pounds and you run with that on well you're supposed to hike or hump like ruck hopping right I ran with it because I was you know I that's what I did right so the date of the day of the day of heart surgery I did a ruck run Jesus because I knew I was gonna be out of commission for a while so [ __ ] it matter get my last one in dude Jesus Christ all I could do I have my training launch after my second heart surgery all I could do was walk so I became an ultra Walker I walked my [ __ ] ass off and I over a period of time it took a year for that thing to heal up in the hill you know my first bubble study after my second heart surgery came back negative or positive the bubble went through again oh no and they're gonna crack me open oh man over that period of time my heart healed around that thing nicely and I passed a second bubble test so the first bubble test was how long after a year it was so the first bubble test after the first surgery was six months and then you had to go through a full six months after that variety heal then you have the second heart surgery and when does the bubble test fail after the second heart surgery it was about six months Jesus Christ and they said and the doctor looked at me and said you know I'm sorry to inform you maybe we have to crack your chest open the next time they're really getting there and so I sat back thinking this could be a third heart surgery and then that one they said we have to wait for six months to see if this thing's gonna close up right yeah I came back thinking man I'm about to get cracked the [ __ ] open and that bubble got pinned up man Wow when they go through maybe forced it through with your mind it may add something to visualize holy [ __ ] man that is crazy yeah it's crazy one on a ruck run with a hole in your heart - well I did it for several years I said [ __ ] it keep on going man that's amazing now after all said and done everything's good now yeah everything's I mean I'm sure supposed to pop up in my [ __ ] ass not to do that you know everything's good right now I'm always waiting for the next thing to pop up and I hang on the same way I was attack it but yeah I said right now I'm in the best shape my 43 years old just turned 43 February 17th I am in the best shape my life I'm not knocking on wood because life [ __ ] it life comes at you dude so right [ __ ] knocking on wood come at me I mean I would think that you would be a go-to guy for injuries yeah I give anybody had a ball I've had them all I found when you broke the world record for chin-ups didn't you rip your arm apart pull-ups yeah so if you pull up the picture man there's a picture of my hand you'll see I'll know what is it pull ups are so pull ups are here hands out hands out and chin ups our hands right hands forward so I failed three times before I finally got it the third time and I the first time I ripped the [ __ ] on my forearm and then the second time you'll see there's a picture of my hand and it it's a third-degree burn so that's my hand oh Jesus man what in the [ __ ] is going to look at you a bit by a wolf so what's funny about that as you see that uh that doesn't create after one pull-up so if you can imagine the pain of because you know you have one contact point that's it mmm you like running you can overcome it cuz it these big giant legs and right it's different when you have these little fragile punk-ass hands touching the bar no imagine four thousand thirty pull-ups how many times you're coming that bar coming off right now way 207 pounds at the time so I was I was a bigger guy I'm like 195 or 185 now so I was almost 22 pounds heavier so I was a lot bigger than I am right there ma'am you look pretty get that [ __ ] man so you were doing it in sets of five sets of five so as you see I have these different people who are witnessing you you have to have your your your number there to make sure that you're you know qualified for the Guinness Book of World Record that's 1450 I have a long way to govern another four thousand and fifteen pull-ups to go hurt Jesus Christ so yeah and how long did you do this over 24 hours it was seven so I brought it at 17 Wow and I was [ __ ] over it what did it feel like in the last chin up you know what actually here's a video that we have and I was chasing this guy named Steven Highland so this guy named Steven Highland had the record and the video is my last three pulls for broke the record I'm talking so much [ __ ] there's another [ __ ] I'm like hey [ __ ] you thought was good get it huh I told you [ __ ] ass [ __ ] I'm coming after you I'm here now is this me talking [ __ ] it's a cool video but I felt um I felt nothing I was just happy I have to do anymore I just 67,000 pull-ups in nine months G in training first record for 4000 and the failures so I I did the first time in September failed miserably on this today shot the twenty five hundred and eighty eight or something like that film is me for millions of people two months later November tried again failed again two months later in January 19th I finally [ __ ] got it so after I got it wasn't like I'm happy it was like I gotta do more [ __ ] pull-ups anymore Roger that so it was I had a [ __ ] check that [ __ ] but you were doing them when I got here today you know why cuz now it's a party dude I don't like doing this we could get somebody knocks him out you don't like doing them so you got to do them that's my whole life isn't it like someone someone gets drunk on a certain whiskey like if they smell it they'll get disgusted like like Jagermeister or something like that they smell it no oh right is that what it's like with you chin ups along with envelopes with a lot of a lot of things yeah right now I'm like running out like and people don't believe it but you know I was I was a big guy twice in my life so hence the reason why I just don't like running man it hurts it's brutal it sucks going out and I'm gonna be gone for two hours or I'm gonna be going 49 hours right running on a one mile track [ __ ] I'm not crazy man it sucks I mean you know people put me in this category of you must be some crazy guy who loves it no man no that's why I do it though that's the only way to couch your [ __ ] brain man I want me to get hard a lot people take these classes on mental toughness I even steals in the class about visualization self-talk eat an elephant one by that time breathing control Roger that you gotta put yourself in hellacious situation it's a lifestyle how are you going to react how are you gonna react all that training goes out the [ __ ] door when you're in the [ __ ] cold water and you're [ __ ] miserable it's the first hour of a hundred thirty hours of hell week and that first wave goes over your head and you're the codis you've been in your life and your mind goes from our one to our one [ __ ] thirty all that [ __ ] self talking [ __ ] dude you ain't think about anything about getting the [ __ ] out of here but if you live this [ __ ] on a daily basis and you know how to calm your mind down this self-talk will help all that stuff will help but usually we react we have pain we have suffering we react and we react about get the [ __ ] out of here we got to go it's those people were able to control that [ __ ] feeling and [ __ ] flight and say no I'm a [ __ ] there's a way through this it's not going to be your forever I'm not cold right now I let the three of them I'm not cold now I'm in a nice warm studio with you you got to think about that [ __ ] it's just going to end it's going to end but we don't know that we don't think that at that time it's gonna last forever and then you get to sit back on Friday there by walking across the you know back on the grinder all the 16 17 guys that graduated Hill week and you a chance to watch these guys victorious and then you get the chance think about that you take that hot warm shower first thing that comes to your [ __ ] minds why the [ __ ] that I quit so what keeps me going I've quit several things I know what's on the back end the [ __ ] quitting it's a lifetime of thinking about why [ __ ] did I do that and I ain't [ __ ] doing that there's something about talking to a guy like you that a lot of people hope that you're gonna say some magic thing that's gonna click in their brain everybody gets change who they are like what is it what is the thing that's why people go to these self-help conferences and they take these classes and they hope that someone's gonna say something that changes the way their mind works it's hilarious to me it is it's kind of hilarious to me too but what is also hilarious is that what you're saying is that you have to do those things you have to suffer you have to live in it you have to be comfortable in it and then maybe some of that [ __ ] will help you a little bit along the way period and I went to I was a when I was a still recruiter I got invited to MIT smart ass [ __ ] there man I'm not that I miss a garanimal Dumber knuckle-dragger and there was this guy that I forget his name but he was like the top head head guy old white guy you know all genius doubt and we were on this panel and they were asking us all these questions about the mind mental toughness and [ __ ] he was answering them and I wasn't answering any questions now I'll never forget he was just answering off of theory mmm he never put his [ __ ] ass and [ __ ] you read a bunch of [ __ ] books and you think that you know how the [ __ ] mind works and [ __ ] I've gone through hell just a kid and then all the way up until now right so I know so that theory is [ __ ] yeah there's a lot of good stuff out there you can read from people but I had lived hell and when you put yourself in hell that's the only time you can figure out how the [ __ ] to get through that [ __ ] you can't you can't read somebody else's book about some theory on how to do [ __ ] some guy who was set up in there a nice warm office and read and wrote some book with a nice cup of coffee in the [ __ ] hand no I want to see that guy who put immersed himself in [ __ ] hell and he thought about quitting and leaving him and his wife and his kids and why am I here is it is it worth it all this crazy [ __ ] it still said if I not a way to get through it so basically that's that's the bottom line of it all we all want to read about how we can quickly get somewhere that's why that six-minute abs and also it's so powerful did you make it some results from it they're not permanent the permanent result comes from you [ __ ] I say it all time you have to suffer you have to make that a tattoo on your [ __ ] brain so when that hard time comes again you don't forget it you may forget it for a second but you can go back in the cookie jar call it it's a it's something that we've all indoors I call it the cookie jar and we often forget how hard we are but you got reflect back take a cup of sighs reflect I've been through this I've been through that and then remind yourself I'm a bad [ __ ] and then you can get do that [ __ ] but if you don't believe it you ever endured [ __ ] you're just blowing smoke man and you're not gonna get to anything what was this guy saying look what was his theories that he was throwing out there his theories was about I forget exactly what it was was there some about what the mind does under stress and how we can't he said how we can't do something and I did it I did what he said we couldn't do like what was he saying he couldn't do it was somebody if you're born if you're born a certain way somebody if you're born a certain way you can't become this way it was totally saying that would Who I am now like I had to be born with some not genetic power or some some gift from God but I had to have some kind of special gift had to have some kinda special gift I forget what set me off but was that we had to be - to be somewhere you had to be born with it what was the concept and I know what I was born with and I know the battle that I had in my mind so when he said it is sad to look at my face and some on the crowd ask me a question yeah I totally count addicted everything he said and I was like nah man I mean I [ __ ] know for a fact that you can be this [ __ ] up dude like really [ __ ] up dude and with the right mindset it is it sounds so easy with the right mindset doesn't sound easy it's know what you're saying it sounds very simplistic answer right you can you can't but you have to go into the dark chambers that we often shut off and you got to open them up you can open up and fight that [ __ ] demon get in there talk to that [ __ ] and say what's up and we often take that we all like to take this four-lane highway the easy highway has has [ __ ] signs it has restaurants we all loved that four-lane highway we always step over the shovel and all I did was I picked up that [ __ ] shovel and that shovel I made my own path and you may have big boulders and [ __ ] they may be getting towards and miles up the road faster than you but going through this path of life this journey over here that you make yourself that's incredibly difficult but it comes out to the other end of that [ __ ] is some glorious [ __ ] that you can't even explain to people and we're afraid bottom line is most of us even the people have all these theories and [ __ ] it's easier to accept the fact that I'm just not good enough I wasn't made to do that and yeah some of us can't be LeBron [ __ ] James but I'll tell you right now man we can do a lot of [ __ ] when it comes to this pure long guts and willpower and getting through [ __ ] we have a lot more with a lot more and we think we have yeah the problem with a guy like that with his theory is his theories of based on results and those results are based on human beings and most human beings there's certain people that are born with certain gifts like a guy like LeBron James is a physical talent you know John Jones and MMA obviously physical talent but there's when you look at someone who's super successful you always assume that it has to be because of some sort of physical gifts because people look at themselves and I'm sure this doctor this old dude probably had like a little gut and probably exactly I looked a little tiny arms weak shoulders and probably thought well there's certain people that are just mesomorphic and probably broke it down all these scientific terms right you know they just have a fast twitch muscle fibers and they'll say all this crazy [ __ ] that is true at the very highest levels of the winners right but it doesn't mean that you can't become that no it just means that it's too painful for most people to go through so very few people ever get there so if you look at the actual results he would be correct but he's not correct because he doesn't take the shovel exactly that's not the more the story does not some easy lit up streetlights right half with nice smooth roads right it's a difficult [ __ ] where you're gonna fail and you're gonna be in your head you could be saying I'm not good enough and it's how you get through that is how you get through that on a daily basis when that thing is say man I'm 43 I've done so much you start to become civilized the refrigerator gets full you start getting making money and you start I'm not getting cold anymore I'm retired what's in at forty people shouldn't be playing basketball or football or beating them up you start to believe this [ __ ] and it becomes in your [ __ ] mind like there's people who are retiring you know at 40-something years or 37 years old at 43 I'm still putting a hundred-mile weeks still doing thousands of pull-ups thousands of push-ups because I'm not allowing myself to become civilized the worst didn't happen to a man's become civilized you lose that [ __ ] fight you you you you lose that why the [ __ ] am i doing this [ __ ] I'm good you ain't good man you ain't never [ __ ] arrived and that's just my mentality you may have more but you'd never [ __ ] arrive you want to be uncommon a most uncommon people period uncommon amongst uncommon people is one of the greatest ways to put it that's it like if you're if you're like for me what got me in trouble with the Navy SEALs is I want to be one so bad so bad I fought my ass off yeah I saw them as uncommon people very uncommon but once you become a Navy SEAL you're all Navy SEALs so guess what happens your [ __ ] common again I wanted to be uncommon amongst uncommon people I want it to be the guy I don't care if you [ __ ] like knock if you understand me I didn't give a [ __ ] once I went through this [ __ ] journeys path of life you ain't got in a whole bunch of [ __ ] guys that don't [ __ ] like me I don't give a [ __ ] I'm a warrior period who's like I've been a lot more combat to me a Warriors not always that words a [ __ ] who says hey I'm here again today I'm here again tomorrow gonna be here the next day I'm 50 years old I'm still [ __ ] getting after it it's a person that puts no [ __ ] limit on what's possible and that's what got me in trouble like that's why I went to Ranger School as a seal that's why I try to go to Delta Force twice you know I bet I've been through all these different training programs cuz I was looking for in the military what I saw is in the training these people get their ass handed to him after they get out a lot of them get civilized I always wanted to go back in the training and I we were always I want to go back to war in the war was in that training program where you see guys you can quit guys who are brutal guys who are suffering guys who are you go so as a seal you don't volunteer for Ranger school I did I put in seven chicks got turned down I get you know got accepted I went at 28 29 years old and they go why did you go because I started becoming civilized I started becoming complacent I I needed to get my [ __ ] ass kicked again and when you go as a seal going down to it you have no rank and Ranger school you could be a major you're just [ __ ] Joe Brown you're nobody and you're not eating you're not sleeping so I always would put myself I would immerse myself and [ __ ] like that even IRA climb the ladder and I intentionally fall back down that [ __ ] to say all right man getting soft dude getting soft kick your [ __ ] ass again and I you know it's kind of process did you find resistance from that amongst other guys that didn't like to make that you were making them uncomfortable because that is something that people there's a natural instinct that people have when someone's working harder than them to somehow another diminish that person well I know that a lot of guys don't like me for a lot of reasons and I realize that I am a guy that doesn't care if you like me or not and when you're an alpha male and you're against other alpha males and we eat our own alpha males eat their own now I love that [ __ ] let's [ __ ] go man I want to eat a man I'm all about that kind of mentality but I was sometimes take it to another level now I went part of a of a good old boy network I don't wanna be part I want to be David [ __ ] gaga for too long in my life and it got me in trouble for time I left I wanted to be accepted growing up I lied I [ __ ] did what I could for if you [ __ ] like UFC and I didn't I love it I love it man let's go [ __ ] watch me be my friend be my buddy that [ __ ] weak-ass [ __ ] I found out through this path of life who is David Gaga's Who am I so going through all I did it alone there was no [ __ ] trophy on the [ __ ] wall on the mantel that trophy is my [ __ ] brain no one helped me get you know I pay my [ __ ] bills no one did [ __ ] for me no one ran those [ __ ] miles lost that [ __ ] weight with the hood I suffered on my own and developed this man who said Who I am a very competitive ultra competitive do that take it what you want man I call that personal sovereignty exactly who's not a lot of people that have that that's me and there's a lot of people that change who they are depending upon what people want from them and that's that's me yeah that's important man most people struggle their whole life to find out who they are struggle their whole their whole life to find out what defines them what they actually enjoy and what they don't you start putting yourself in situations that suck you'll find yourself yeah you'll find it real quick that is the thing right and that's one of the things that have gotten from paying attention to you is that you what you're preaching what you're talking about is finding yourself through struggle it's it it's only way to find yourself you don't find yourself if you like best present and you [ __ ] press all the [ __ ] time what are you finding out if you like to swim that's all you want to do is swim what are you finding out put that in people always I people talk about triple down on your [ __ ] strengths right that's the [ __ ] weakest [ __ ] in the world no triple down on your [ __ ] weaknesses yeah find out something about yourself you right know that you're good [ __ ] you know the happy [ __ ] right that's why I'm on my Facebook page because why don't you talk about good times you know how to get you that [ __ ] [ __ ] you don't need a [ __ ] you don't need to I tell you how to get to its happy right that's easy [ __ ] right I want to tell you how you can help yourself get through the times that suck real life this is real life 90% of your life will suck 10% will be [ __ ] happy you may be lucky God have a lot of [ __ ] money have a great ass woman all this [ __ ] trust me one on one with that [ __ ] guy he's missing something his life still sucks that he hasn't faced something that bothered him his whole [ __ ] life something is still eating that [ __ ] up almost everybody everybody eating you the [ __ ] up but maybe you found a good way how I did growing up on how to ignore that voice that's saying you ain't facing some [ __ ] period man I'm not special I just stopped listening I I listen to that voice it was why I talk so [ __ ] aggressive people said man do you believe in God you cuss so much when I say [ __ ] it's a is letting you know what I'm thinking if I try to make it all pretty and [ __ ] that's not what my life was it was a violent violent struggle daily to get where I'm at today I'm not gonna water it down like a watered down [ __ ] wasn't fun ain't fun today I'm happy don't you think that your happiness is probably elevated by the amount of pain that you've gone through a hundred percent so the amount of suffering that you understand the amount of pain that you've gone through makes you appreciate the happiness and the beautiful moments with much more intensity that's what weak people miss about my story weak people hear this soft kid I'm a guy he must be miserable oh my god what the hell is wrong with them you're missing the [ __ ] story you're not listening to the story man look what I overcame if that doesn't put some badge of honor tattooed in your [ __ ] brain for the rest of your life you can die today talking to Joe Rogan you're missing the story man am I happy what the [ __ ] do you think don't miss it don't misunderstand the past and wish I speak for not being intensely happy happiest person in the world but I'm not done so not gonna speak to you like oh man everything is great no I have a lot more [ __ ] to do a lot more [ __ ] to do well this is in the same use of the word that you used the Warriors mentality the Warriors life right this is this is the way that you can keep balanced and sane right and and keep a good grip on who you are period and like there's a quote that was said I don't know who said it but was a great quote this guy said going into combat going into war out of the hundred men that going to war tension you [ __ ] be there eighty of them are this target's ten do most of or nine do most of fighting one is a warrior and it's a true quote to life I saw it going through train I saw it everywhere I went there's so many people who just show up to life that shouldn't even [ __ ] be around and there's a few people who do all the work I wanted to be part of that nine and I'm working towards being that one and that's how I live my life now what are you doing with your life these days right now I keep the same I'm very routine I get every morning I run I go to the gym and then at nighttime I stretch out I am a mom just trying to develop a business costing me a lot of money trying to do that I'm just getting out I'm an introvert so I never want to get on social media I'm not big on that I'm big on being with yourself I believe all these [ __ ] cameras and phones and [ __ ] it takes you away from the most powerful thing in the world which is your [ __ ] mind so I try hard to continue to grow that I'm trying to break a record again I'm trying to cross Death Valley as fast as possible top of Mount Whitney and I'm constantly trying to put goals and for me but the biggest thing is I'm trying to find more of myself and the only way I can find more is to silence the world out as much as I can because it's getting busier every day it's getting faster and the faster it gets the more you are missing who the [ __ ] you are so I trapped my own mind a lot and said look man I put my phone away I'll put [ __ ] away and I go dark I go dark a lot and it's because I have to find out I'm on a journey of life and we all have a different journey and I want to be in my [ __ ] pine box and I believe your spirit lives forever has too it's too [ __ ] powerful no way in hell that thing that's dies when you die I want to be able to look back on my life and I'm all dead and be so [ __ ] proud of myself forever this is all temporary [ __ ] to me I want to be forever proud of who I was as a man and change who I used to be the liar the insecure guy the guy who can whatever I want to be proud but if I died now if I die at 84 diet 9800 I want to look at myself as a proud of myself don't you think that also like we were saying that because you've gone through so much struggle you appreciate happiness true happiness do you think that you appreciate discipline because you weren't discipline do you think you appreciate the hard work you put in because you used to be weak yes I appreciate self-discipline yes I never had a crazy thing about what you know you say that I have a [ __ ] can wake me up at 3 o'clock in the [ __ ] morning and say hey you gotta get your [ __ ] in I had no trainer I have a nutritionist it was the self-discipline that I had to survive not survive I was weak to thrive no one say man you're 297 pounds man I wanna help you out I mean you're [ __ ] you're not smart I'm gonna help you out I had to work at all this [ __ ] I had to overcome and and it self discipline is everything if you don't have it I don't look at you right now I know you're capable of more it's not discipline so much for me it's all on you it's all on you the self part it was big we need someone to hold people accountable [ __ ] that [ __ ] man [ __ ] that [ __ ] we we count on people too much to get us through [ __ ] and we look to our right we look to our left we're looking for help and if you can build that self you can build that total accountability in oneself and it's not about being selfish I'm trying to create a better me so hopefully people who are hearing this are taking it the right way can say I can run a mile anybody run a 205 [ __ ] mile doing for Venis it ain't bout all that [ __ ] she doesn't matter I want you to see how [ __ ] far you can go and that's all it's about yourself and that's where it all comes from Willis and I guarantee you've already done that what you experienced from watching that television show and with what got you out the door what got you to sort of take the first steps to change your life will you experience by watching rocky what you experience of inspiration those are critical for people they need to know that someone's done something that someone's done something that's greater than they what they could imagine themselves doing and they want to take a step towards trying to be better that inspiration is gigantic and sometimes it comes across as corny you know people read it too much of it online it becomes it drowns out you lose that the meaning gets lost I mean there's and there's a lot of posers because a lot of people are out there that are there pretending that they're trying to offer up inspiration or a true honest account of their experiences but really what they're trying to do is say something that's gonna get likes right you know they're trying to say things that they think people are gonna go yeah double high five right you know there's a thing that people are doing when they're just trying to just get social cred I said yes social media is man I'm gonna paint you the picture of my fake life right right right I paint you a picture of my [ __ ] real life yeah period like it or not man but that brought that real life is fuel for people right it's fuel for me I mean I died I love that [ __ ] I live off of it there's a lot of people that I follow online and you're one of them that I can get something out of that I could watch a short clip of you talking I'm sure clips of this podcast people gonna play these clips and go for [ __ ] crazy runs afterwards right well hope so [ __ ] yeah uh-huh you don't even have to hope it's gonna happen that's good that's good what is this business you're doing well it's my own Goggins LLC basically I I'm investing in myself I'm invested in myself and I hope that this story is can can change somebody's life not to be me cuz they ain't bout me and I and I I try to be as real as I can because we're all [ __ ] for in this world we're all hurting and I try to take away all titles you want to give me that you know that I did not come from that [ __ ] that's right to be so authentic and so real about my own insecurities my own faults my this being a [ __ ] up person I'm not the best at anything I'm not I'm not gifted I'm just driven and it's all about trying to share that message with people this is all about you know I speak to a lot of people and that's what that's what I do now and how are you doing it as a business I do something more of a tional speaking but you know right now I'm not really try making a lot of [ __ ] money I'm just trying to build the brand I was authentic as possible because I don't want to build it too fast because my biggest fear in life is people can rewrite through a [ __ ] that's not real I do it all the time like a lot of people have these great quotes and they and they mass produce I can't mass-produce something man Brian and they and they had these great quotes and [ __ ] but are you living that [ __ ] which you dis quoted in how powerful it may sound are you getting up every [ __ ] morning and I'm not working out whatever are you really getting the [ __ ] after are you just talking to motivate people right and I don't want to be that guy who are you talking to pretend that you're exactly after and I people make this big money over here the side which Robin made a lot and they they talk this [ __ ] and they're off this until it's gone right and all Finnick a tall man you know it's all this [ __ ] right and I read it on my mask and [ __ ] right [ __ ] man [ __ ] wake up get after it live what you're saying and then it comes people can see when I talk the reason I talk so [ __ ] just passionate cuz I'm reliving my [ __ ] life I'm reliving this morning when I got up I want to do that [ __ ] I'm reliving everything I did it and I can't speak to you like all calm and [ __ ] [ __ ] sucks it sucks man so whenever I start talking about like after this podcast you'll see man god you're so calm right now what the [ __ ] is wrong with you I'm not going back through that [ __ ] man I'm not I'm not going back through the the suffering and [ __ ] that it took to become Who I am today some story so I built this brand to the point where I can slowly hopefully make people from motivated to driven because motivation is crap [ __ ] people right now maybe listen to this [ __ ] they'll be motivated to go run if it's closed somewhere where they're at a lot of my first we'll shut that door go back inside that's motivation it comes and go as how you feel if you and your wife are good if you and your kids are good if you're good at work you're motivated I like the [ __ ] whose life is imploded ain't got [ __ ] in life and says I still got [ __ ] good after today man it's what it's about so that's when you move from motivation to driven to obsessed and I want people to realize once you get to this portion of over here the driven obsessed part your stoppable this commitment that you have to authenticity is one of the reasons why people are connected to what you've met your messages that's one of the reasons why what you're saying you don't want to grow it too fast you don't want it to be [ __ ] you're terrified of that thing just like we were talking about with weak people you terrified a scene that weakness in yourself right you know we all see that we've all seen motivational things that are [ __ ] we've all talked to people that are talking and you realize there's nothing really that they're connected to they're not really connected to their words their words just a bunch of words they've pieced together because they sound like something that someone who's you know enlightened on the subject would say right yeah it doesn't it doesn't it doesn't connect at all so your struggle now is to try to figure out how to stay you and get the message out but still be fully connected to that message right that's you know it's not so much a struggle because I'm not really about I'm not driven by the business I'm not I'm not doing by trying to be I I make a very small salary from being retired from the military that's all I need so I'm not fast - I'm a minimalist [ __ ] give me a backpack of [ __ ] ground and sleep on and a pull-up bar and a [ __ ] some running shoes and a Subway sandwich with some [ __ ] and I'm [ __ ] straight so it's um I believe in patience I'm a patient dude I can watch the piece of grass grow for 20 years because I know that this is how you get somewhere in life by being that monk-like mentality and being able to watch something grow very calmly patiently and that's all I'm doing right now about monies and about people knowing me I'll keep you like me whoever wants to hear this is out there so so your your goal is to grow this right slowly very slowly and your goal is to grow this in order to impact people period that's it it's not about me what do you get out of impacting people it's a good question I don't I don't get anything out of it I'm a tool but you must get something there must be personal satisfaction must be a connection to those people there must be it must be enriching to you it's hard to connect with people because there's quite a few now that are coming in right it's my duty it's my duty to share my it's kind like it's somebody who discovered a new earth you know and discover the people on it that in the water source and the food source I discovered a whole nother part of your [ __ ] brain that a lot of people don't even know about it's my job by being the [ __ ] on this journey and being a discovery person being the person that maybe I discovered this part I discovered a very important part that I haven't met many people that have discovered this part I'm sure there's a lot out there but it's my job now take these weak people in the category that I was in and say uh-uh stop reading the [ __ ] stop listening to the [ __ ] and if my story of success can impact somebody it is my job is my duty to share this too as much as I'm not really fond of it I I'm the kind of guy that wants to sit in the [ __ ] room and just be me just be me alone by myself that's who I am I have to get uncomfortable and tell people all this [ __ ] you think it feels good tell me about it I'm a fourth grade reading level in high school I stuttered I lied to people to be their [ __ ] friends I didn't feel good it doesn't feel good at all but maybe someone's doing the same [ __ ] and maybe they can realize wow that [ __ ] was a piece of [ __ ] and he [ __ ] now is a Navy SEAL tired guy and Rosie's miles and was 297 pounds and pathetic [ __ ] and Wow if he would say why are you talking so it's the [ __ ] truth I was a [ __ ] pathetic [ __ ] man people cannot say that to themselves it's we have to choose these great [ __ ] magical words that that makes that make people feel good tell yourself the truth if something - cause you're [ __ ] fat they may be bullying you but you might be [ __ ] fat someone calls you dumb it's me but you might be [ __ ] dumb its life man take it for what it's worth and change it and that terrible feeling when someone does tell you they have fat you can use that as fuel period and that's all this is about and where it goes if it goes somewhere and whatever you know I don't give a [ __ ] well you said something that I think of when I run and it's that most people quit at 40% I said that's not 40% rule man I love that about 40% rule man and I am I really developed that through my heart surgeries and I developed that through that first hunch at my run is I thought I had given 100% the house on that chair at Mile 70 I was [ __ ] up I thought I'd given 100% and to go that last I go man there had this I wasn't even near 100% so I came up with this thing called the 40% rule it's basically where you it's like a car you put a governor on a car and they said the car can go 130 that governor stops the car at 91 and you're driving thinking man I want to [ __ ] Florida but I can't go I can't go any faster we do it to a brain we put a governor brain second we feel pain discomfort suffering all those words that we hate to say cuz we in this happy peaceful world we live in now we stop we slow down and if you can get through these different barriers and gain five percent 2% 3% that 40% becomes 60 that's 60 per kid kind of 70 and 80 and 90 and then you're hopefully one day near a hundred I don't I don't know many people who probably add a hundred I mean we think we're there but there's so much more it isn't a hundred at death's door though I love that I think it's true I think that's 100% true I think when you were laying in that tub you'd knocked on a door that is that is a hundred percent true no one has ever if that is our position I didn't give a hundred percent in that 101 mile run I did for the first time so that's the scary thing that's the scariest thing in the world I didn't die you probably gave 99.99999 man dude I don't know how to end this any better than that so let's just wrap this up if people want to find your stuff what's the best place to go and look for it I'm just at David Goggins man social media or Instagram Facebook I don't tweak that much stuff out because I'm I write these I write messages and I always link that you know on Twitter to my Facebook and Instagram but it's just at David Goggins it was an honor and privilege thanks like your lunch man I really really really appreciate it thank you Dave and Goggins ladies and gentlemen go after it you [ __ ] come on if that doesn't fire me [Applause] [Music] [Music]
