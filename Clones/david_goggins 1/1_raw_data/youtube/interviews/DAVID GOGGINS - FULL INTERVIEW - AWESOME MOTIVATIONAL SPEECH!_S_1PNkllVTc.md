[00:00] foreign
[00:06] so what I want to do is I want you all
[00:08] to help me welcome to the stage someone
[00:11] that I'm super proud and privileged to
[00:13] introduce you to
[00:15] um he's someone you might have heard a
[00:17] story you might not have but I can tell
[00:18] you right now that I know that you're
[00:21] going to gain a huge level of awareness
[00:23] and distinction from meeting him and I
[00:27] want to introduce you to our friend Mr
[00:28] David Goggins
[00:35] [Applause]
[00:37] we're an interesting species as a human
[00:39] being all of us know that we're designed
[00:42] for more designed for greatness and let
[00:44] me tell you why
[00:45] is because when we're in the presence of
[00:48] greatness
[00:49] we see a piece of ourselves in that in
[00:52] them when we see someone that's doing
[00:54] something that's extraordinary
[00:57] we identify ourselves in that that's why
[01:00] it makes the back of our hair on the
[01:02] neck stand up right
[01:04] and when we witness that it has nothing
[01:07] to do with Talent it has nothing to do
[01:09] with skill
[01:10] what resonates the most with us is when
[01:14] we see someone with heart that's
[01:17] overcoming to become they're doing what
[01:20] isn't as if it were
[01:21] how many of you see that when you see
[01:23] his story yes or no
[01:26] but for those that don't know your story
[01:28] because I saw probably I'd say 30 40 of
[01:31] the audience they don't know your story
[01:33] I don't do it justice I'm not going to
[01:35] attempt to do it
[01:37] um but Captain share with us you know
[01:39] David Goggins you know I mean who are
[01:42] you where did your story begin
[01:44] well I won't get too too deep I'll give
[01:46] you the quick you know Cliff No
[01:48] highlights
[01:50] I was born with a very abusive father
[01:54] um beat his army every day was an
[01:57] alcoholic
[01:58] I end up suffering with um toxic stress
[02:02] the last incident that happened in our
[02:05] family
[02:06] was my dad came home one night from work
[02:08] real drunk
[02:10] and when he got drunk he got real
[02:11] violent
[02:13] he um had me go in the room take all my
[02:15] clothes off this is very typical it's a
[02:17] typical day for our family
[02:19] and you know you have to do anything
[02:21] like major for him to beat your ass he
[02:24] whatever he just get mad and just beat
[02:26] you up so I was about eight years old
[02:29] and my dad had me go in the bedroom he
[02:32] was very tactical mind tactics had me
[02:35] lay on the bed 90 degree angles my butt
[02:37] was hanging off
[02:38] door shut so my back was facing the door
[02:42] and I waited there for 45 minutes
[02:45] he walked up and was beating me all over
[02:48] the place
[02:49] my mom saw it she walked in and it was
[02:52] one of the worst beans ever got she says
[02:54] something to him set him off she smacked
[02:57] you know he smacked her in the face
[02:58] knocked her out gathered by her hair
[03:01] if you actually down the stairs by her
[03:02] hair
[03:03] we ended up leaving Buffalo New York
[03:06] and we went to a small town in Brazil
[03:08] Indiana so at this time my mom's you
[03:11] know she did this for 17 years I did it
[03:13] for eight
[03:14] and her soul was taken by him I was all
[03:18] messed up had a horrible foundation and
[03:20] we moved to a place called Brazil
[03:22] Indiana
[03:23] Brazil Indiana was about 15 minutes from
[03:27] Center Point Center Point was Hub of the
[03:30] KKK at the time so it was about five
[03:33] black families we were one of them so
[03:35] coming from this Foundation from Buffalo
[03:37] New York and moving to this area it was
[03:41] horrible for me but when you're young
[03:42] you know being a young black kid with a
[03:45] bunch of whites wasn't that bad and like
[03:47] I said about five black families
[03:49] but I didn't realize I had a severe
[03:51] learning disability
[03:53] because like when I was growing up I
[03:55] never went to school my dad had us
[03:57] working the skating rink the family
[03:58] business he didn't believe in going to
[03:59] school
[04:00] so fast forward
[04:02] my my third grade year comes and I'm
[04:05] copying the whole time I'm cheating on
[04:06] every test because they want to put me
[04:08] in a special school we all know what
[04:10] special means you're about to be you
[04:12] know have a nice title on you for the
[04:13] rest of your life so when I heard this I
[04:15] started this cheating so when I got to
[04:18] my junior year in high school I had a
[04:19] third grade reading level my mom never
[04:21] saw a report card we lived in a seven
[04:23] dollar a month place we lived on
[04:25] government subsidized apartment food
[04:27] stamps all that good stuff
[04:30] and
[04:31] um around my when I was about 14 years
[04:33] old my mom met a guy so we moved from
[04:36] Brazil to Indianapolis Indiana
[04:38] he got murdered
[04:40] he got murdered we moved back to
[04:41] Indianapolis Indiana or my father Brazil
[04:43] Indiana by this time the kids were grown
[04:46] and when you're young they'll know black
[04:48] and white you're just David Goggins when
[04:50] you get in high school they start
[04:51] realizing you look a little different
[04:53] so I got my car my first car ever got
[04:56] was a brown citation
[04:58] I pull up to school leave it there all
[05:00] day come out of school spray paint on it
[05:02] was [ __ ] we're going to kill you
[05:04] so this went on from my sophomore year
[05:06] to my senior year
[05:08] but my junior year I was like I gotta
[05:10] get to hell out of Brazil Indiana
[05:12] and I was like I want to go in the Air
[05:14] Force I'd get out of here and they join
[05:16] the military
[05:17] so I went to the military and and the
[05:20] guy was like Hey you gotta take an ASVAB
[05:22] test having a third grade reading level
[05:24] I didn't know he had to take a test to
[05:25] get in the military
[05:26] so the as-baptist I sit down trying to
[05:29] take it and I got a 20 the first time so
[05:32] I went back home and got my best friend
[05:33] Johnny so I can copy off of him
[05:36] Johnny came in took the test he had test
[05:38] a I had test B so I couldn't cheat
[05:42] so long story short you get three
[05:44] chances to take this ASVAB test
[05:47] on the third chance I had six months to
[05:50] pretty much study for this test that's
[05:52] when my whole life got revealed to my
[05:54] mom she was always gone she didn't know
[05:56] I was flunking out of school she know I
[05:58] wasn't going to school because getting
[05:59] you know getting bullied getting called
[06:01] [ __ ] all this other stuff
[06:02] so I walk into my mom was going on we
[06:05] didn't have much money so she got me a
[06:07] tutor for one hour a week that cost 15
[06:09] bucks so I had six months four hours a
[06:13] month to study and what the tutor
[06:15] realized was I can't retain anything
[06:17] from all the toxic stress I don't know
[06:19] if it's a learning disability or what I
[06:20] can't retain stuff my my mind was just
[06:23] messed up for my life
[06:25] so How I Learned was I had to get spiral
[06:29] notebooks and literally if I had a
[06:31] manual I had to write down every single
[06:33] word of the manual so it may take you an
[06:35] hour to learn would take me six or seven
[06:37] days to learn and just literally write
[06:39] it down so I didn't really retain it I
[06:41] just memorized it so I can go in my mind
[06:43] right now I remember page 71
[06:46] look at the question and go okay that's
[06:48] what I saw that's how I remembered it
[06:50] and put it down so I ended up passing
[06:52] the test
[06:53] I passed the test go back get in the Air
[06:55] Force and I wanted to be Air Force para
[06:57] rescue men it's like a special
[06:59] operations guy and I didn't know that um
[07:02] blacks and water not so much
[07:06] I know this though
[07:08] so in Special Ops what gets everybody is
[07:12] the water
[07:13] you know and being that there's only one
[07:16] percent of all Special Operations that
[07:18] are black had no idea at 19 years old
[07:20] this was the case they give you this
[07:22] warning order so now I pass this ASVAB
[07:25] test I'm a senior in high school and I'm
[07:27] going through this warning order and it
[07:29] pushed up sit-ups pull-ups all this
[07:31] stuff
[07:32] and so I'm doing all this but the last
[07:34] page has swimming okay easy day
[07:37] I went to uh Barnes and Noble wherever I
[07:39] went I got a how-to book on swimming
[07:43] first page was easy float right
[07:46] so my black ass gets the water and I'm
[07:48] like okay it's cool
[07:49] I didn't know any of this [ __ ] all right
[07:52] so I get in the water and everything was
[07:54] literally I taught myself everything in
[07:57] my whole life
[07:58] so I get in the water and lay back I'm
[08:00] looking up and I long dark the bottom of
[08:02] the pool
[08:02] I'm gonna Obama pool literally walking
[08:04] like this
[08:06] looking up thinking what the hell so I
[08:08] can't even swim so I pushed off I
[08:09] grabbed the gun on the Lifeguard sees me
[08:11] comes over and says hey I've taught
[08:13] thousands of people how to swim I said
[08:16] okay great man it was okay look just
[08:18] relax just need to relax swimming is all
[08:20] about relaxing
[08:22] okay relax let me go long dark bomb the
[08:25] pool I come up he says man you're [ __ ]
[08:31] I said why man he goes well you're
[08:33] negative buoyant I know what that was I
[08:37] do now obviously native buoyancies you
[08:39] know pretty much you sink in the Diagon
[08:41] water you can't float so mostly white
[08:43] people out here can float
[08:46] seventy percent of African-Americans
[08:48] have heavier bone density therefore it's
[08:50] not too fun it's like throwing a cat in
[08:52] the [ __ ] water
[08:55] so basically
[08:57] I take the same mentality that I had
[09:01] to become this intelligent guy you all
[09:05] see today
[09:07] and I applied that yeah
[09:09] make me feel better that's it
[09:13] I'm lying I'm dumb as [ __ ] so anyway I
[09:18] took that same mentality and I applied
[09:20] it to you know swimming
[09:22] after several several months I can swim
[09:26] so now I go into pear Rescue Training
[09:28] get to the first day second day third
[09:30] day I'm kicking butt I'm doing great
[09:33] a few days into training they had the
[09:35] thing called water confidence this
[09:38] special thing was not in the warning
[09:40] order I know what this was basically
[09:42] what water Compass is they drowned your
[09:45] ass
[09:46] so they put 16 pound weight belts on you
[09:49] now I'm negative born already I think to
[09:51] the bound with just myself
[09:54] they put twin ladies on your back and
[09:56] the whole idea if you're supposed to go
[09:58] down to the deep end
[09:59] with all this crap on you have your
[10:02] feelings on your feet and there's a side
[10:04] of the pool you hit the bottom it you
[10:06] know so it's 10 foot you're supposed to
[10:08] bound up you can't swim up jump up get
[10:11] up and they say switch you kick your
[10:13] fins off your feet put them on your
[10:15] hands and this is all you can do to get
[10:17] up
[10:18] so I would literally get like this high
[10:20] and here's the water and here are my
[10:22] lips this is all I was getting for air
[10:25] so over this period of time like 12 more
[10:28] events and all these events are water
[10:30] confidence this is what kicks you out of
[10:32] Special Operations trades not swimming
[10:34] it's not cold water it's not yelling
[10:35] they try to drown you
[10:37] so basically this went off for six more
[10:39] weeks I didn't quit it went from 200
[10:42] guys to about 25 guys I'm still in the
[10:44] class so here I am going through
[10:46] training I don't go to sleep for six
[10:48] weeks because I'm scared to death of the
[10:50] water this program is 10 weeks long
[10:52] after six weeks they thought well the
[10:55] guys in the program are going to go on
[10:57] through for the training because these
[10:59] guys are going to make it they're good
[11:00] to go Roger that
[11:02] so I went to the doctor we all went to
[11:05] the doctor for a nice huge long
[11:07] extensive medical test they drew blood
[11:09] on me three days later they got the
[11:12] results back the doc calls me in the
[11:14] office and says hey David you have
[11:15] sickle cell
[11:17] okay Sickle Cell for you I don't
[11:19] understand or know what it is it's a
[11:21] blood disease that when you get under
[11:22] stressful situations or whatever
[11:24] dehydration your blood will sickle when
[11:27] the sickles stroke heart attack sudden
[11:29] death all those great things that can
[11:31] happen to you
[11:32] so in that period of time
[11:34] I joined the Air Force 175 pounds
[11:38] came out at 297. we'll get to that in a
[11:40] second so they drew my blood and they
[11:43] kept me out of training for a week they
[11:45] didn't know if this Sickle Cell was
[11:47] going to kill me they have a lot of you
[11:49] know information about it so I'm sitting
[11:51] there so when you go from very
[11:52] uncomfortable to comfortable like I was
[11:55] now I wasn't in training I wasn't
[11:57] drowning you never want to go back to
[11:59] being uncomfortable again
[12:00] so I'm sitting there relaxing chilling
[12:02] out I'm thinking well man they're gonna
[12:03] kick me out of here I'm not going to
[12:05] quit though so this is good because I
[12:07] don't want to get back in the water ever
[12:08] again so I can leave training so this is
[12:10] my thought process the doc calls me in a
[12:13] week later I'm skipping down to the
[12:14] doc's office think I'm getting the hell
[12:15] out of here I'm not going to quit but
[12:17] they're kicking me out so that's good
[12:18] for me I'm walking the doctor's office
[12:20] he says Hey ma'am we're putting you back
[12:22] into training
[12:23] ah it's not good it's not good
[12:27] if I'm like okay let me see I've been
[12:28] here six weeks seven weeks three weeks
[12:30] left I can tough it out
[12:33] I'm walking back to my uh compound
[12:35] talking to the head of the school
[12:37] walking to the CEO of the school I said
[12:39] Hey sir they let me back in the train
[12:41] and he goes That's great he goes well
[12:43] you missed a week of training is a very
[12:45] important block of training you missed
[12:47] you have to start from day one but when
[12:49] you're insecure like I was and you're
[12:51] afraid of everything like I used to be
[12:53] you lie really fast because you don't
[12:56] want the person knowing that you're a
[12:58] punk so I sat there and I said you know
[13:00] what the doctor didn't know a whole
[13:02] bunch about sickle cell
[13:04] so I'm not comfortable going back into
[13:07] training
[13:08] the CEO bit off on it and I never quit
[13:12] but he gave me a medical out of pair
[13:14] rescue but you all know I quit then
[13:16] we'll go back in the water but I ain't
[13:18] tell anybody that for several years
[13:20] so in that time frame in four years that
[13:22] became 297 pounds
[13:25] very minimal education as you all know
[13:27] and I get a job spraying for cockroaches
[13:29] at Ecolab okay
[13:32] yeah it's a good job
[13:34] so I don't like cockroaches though
[13:38] so I'm making about a thousand dollars a
[13:40] month spraying for cockroaches and I'm
[13:43] working from 11 o'clock at night to
[13:44] seven o'clock in the morning this is for
[13:46] about six months
[13:48] in my nightly or so at seven o'clock in
[13:51] the morning I would go to Steak and
[13:52] Shake
[13:53] my last stop spray them down get a large
[13:56] chocolate milkshake
[13:58] go across the street to 7-Eleven get a
[14:00] box of mini donuts chocolate donuts
[14:03] because I had a 45 minute commute home I
[14:06] was depressed and food felt good
[14:08] so I'm driving home sipping my shake
[14:10] eating my Donuts chilling out listen to
[14:13] the radio
[14:14] I get home this day my routine was to
[14:16] get home
[14:17] walk in the door turn the TV on walk in
[14:21] the back start taking a shower
[14:24] this particular day the TV came on and
[14:28] they said world's toughest training Navy
[14:31] whatever
[14:33] get my towel which can barely fit me my
[14:35] ass was so big had a pinch it like this
[14:38] so I come back down I sit down all this
[14:40] [ __ ] this falls out
[14:43] so I'm watching TV and I'm like my God
[14:47] man those guys are [ __ ] nuts carrying
[14:49] boats and laws guys going through SEAL
[14:51] training and wet and Sandy getting cold
[14:54] Jack cameras not bubbles chafed up guys
[14:57] ringing the bell just quitting left and
[14:59] right
[15:00] at the end of the show this command
[15:03] officer comes up at graduation there's
[15:04] 22 guys that made it through and the
[15:07] command Officer says we live in the
[15:09] world we're meeting we're mediocrity is
[15:11] often rewarded
[15:12] these men did test mediocrity
[15:15] and I sat there and I had time to
[15:17] reflect back on my life
[15:19] being bullied coming from nothing
[15:21] learning disability messed up Foundation
[15:25] life isn't fair
[15:26] at all
[15:28] at all
[15:30] so what are you gonna do about it I knew
[15:32] that no one would come back to help me
[15:34] no one's going to Miracle me to be
[15:36] somebody special everybody that called
[15:38] me [ __ ] my dad my mom all my
[15:41] situations were on me now and solely on
[15:44] me
[15:45] so I had to start developing an
[15:47] indestructible mental toolbox
[15:50] so I sat there in that couch and I
[15:51] realized man I am a piece of [ __ ]
[15:54] and even though the world helped me get
[15:56] here
[15:57] my false reality helped me even more
[16:01] and listen to somebody else's dialogue
[16:04] further helped me get here so I sat
[16:06] there and I had this Bright Idea being
[16:09] torn 97 pounds to go be a Navy SEAL so
[16:13] the bright idea happens 297 I watched
[16:16] this show
[16:17] I finished my chocolate milkshake and I
[16:19] said I'm gonna be a Navy SEAL
[16:21] so now the next two weeks I'm calling
[16:23] these recruiters up and then you so
[16:25] these guys are used to getting studs
[16:27] that want to be a Navy SEAL not 297
[16:29] pound fat guy

[17:45] the scale had a nice big chart it was a
[17:48] height weight chart so to get the Navy I
[17:50] could be six foot one in 191 pounds
[17:55] that was it I'm 297 he writes it down he
[17:58] goes man you're a big boy and he starts
[18:00] writing stuff down he gets these huge
[18:02] manuals out and brings him out you in
[18:04] the Air Force before yeah how many years
[18:06] four and a half he's doing all these
[18:07] figures calculating stuff up how old are
[18:09] you I'm 24 and a half years old Okay
[18:12] blah blah blah doing this
[18:14] next thing I know he goes hey the
[18:15] program the only program we can get you
[18:17] in to be a Navy SEAL is about to end
[18:19] in three months you have to drop 106
[18:22] pounds in three months Roger that
[18:25] I got my chocolate milkshake and walked
[18:27] out
[18:29] so here I go I go back to work
[18:31] and I'm spraying for cockroaches the
[18:33] Ecolab and I'm chilling out and I'm like
[18:35] you know what man maybe I can just be
[18:37] the best Ecolab guy in the world and I
[18:39] was spraying for cockroaches and I never
[18:41] really looked for cockroach areas so I
[18:43] just spray them so there's these holes
[18:46] in the wall
[18:47] where you're supposed to find a hole in
[18:49] the kitchen is supposed to find a column
[18:50] and that goes along and it kind of
[18:53] flushes out the Cockroaches if you find
[18:55] the right column it's like it's Pay Dirt
[18:58] it's called the money spot so I had my
[19:01] wand in this place I'm talking but I
[19:03] can't talk about it because it's you
[19:05] know I signed a confidentiality
[19:06] agreement okay but it's called Old
[19:09] Country Buffet
[19:13] so I'm spraying for cockroaches
[19:16] and if that's filmed I'm killing you so
[19:19] I'm spraying for cockroaches
[19:22] and my brownie Falls because they have
[19:24] some good ass brownies
[19:27] so I pick up my Brownie and as I pick it
[19:29] up
[19:30] I felt stuff
[19:33] [Applause]
[19:35] and I'm I keep my head focused on the
[19:38] Browning
[19:41] and I'm thinking
[19:42] there's no way in hell
[19:45] I found that and as I'm bending over I
[19:50] had a big ass
[19:51] and my mom would put socks she was so
[19:55] socks in my ass in my and that ripped
[19:57] out
[19:57] and so I'm sitting as a bad time of life
[20:02] and I stayed in this position for a
[20:04] while and I put my hands down here and
[20:06] stuff this fall into my neck and I
[20:08] looked up at the tile and it's open and
[20:09] stuff this is crawling around and
[20:11] falling around I hit the money spot
[20:13] people all right
[20:15] so I give my canister real slow I'm
[20:17] trying to shake my shirt out I get my
[20:19] canister I take my mask off and I leave
[20:22] it there and I get in my car I start it
[20:25] up
[20:26] I sit there for a second and I drive
[20:28] home and I quit my job
[20:33] so yeah
[20:35] done
[20:36] [Applause]
[20:37] but now what am I gonna do your best
[20:40] broadcast to come when you're least
[20:42] motivated where's that come from it
[20:44] comes from basically
[20:45] I had to stop thinking normal I had to
[20:49] stop thinking normal I can no longer be
[20:51] a common man walking around doing common
[20:53] things but no one taught me this stuff
[20:56] it was like I had you know I paid a
[20:58] trainer to come train me Jenny Craig
[21:00] didn't come down and Miracle my ass
[21:02] none of this happened it was on me and
[21:05] that's the thing you have to realize
[21:07] everything you do you may have some
[21:09] support you may not but it's on you you
[21:12] have to make the decision whether you
[21:14] want to be a badass
[21:16] or whether you want just want to be
[21:17] mediocre and everything's okay but being
[21:20] a badass hurts
[21:22] real bad
[21:24] and that's why I didn't want to do it
[21:25] so
[21:27] over the next two and a half months
[21:29] you know boy with details I lost the
[21:32] weight I went back to the recruiter and
[21:35] I went to buds Navy still training and I
[21:37] was the only person in history or navy
[21:39] still trained to go through three hell
[21:40] weeks in one year hell week is 130 hours
[21:42] of continuous training
[21:44] and
[21:46] um starts on Sunday is on Friday you
[21:49] might get two hours of sleep and I did
[21:51] all that in one year why'd it do that in
[21:53] one year catch the chase again there was
[21:56] an old crusty commanding officer named
[21:58] captain Bowen Captain bone was old
[22:00] Vietnam vet this is his last tour Duty
[22:03] and he believed you know so over 70
[22:06] years this train has been going on he
[22:07] believed no matter where you were at you
[22:10] will start from day one if you don't
[22:11] make it through
[22:12] so I get to Wednesday ruptured hernia
[22:15] back to day one week one
[22:17] gets my gets my second hell week I get
[22:19] through that hell week getting ready to
[22:20] start second phase break my kneecap roll
[22:23] back day one week one in my third hell
[22:25] week I'm standing there
[22:27] I have 16 stress fractures so I have 16
[22:30] stress facts this is me and my first two
[22:32] week I believe so I have 16 stress
[22:34] fractures I'm on my crutches I'm looking
[22:36] at him and he says uh Goggins this is
[22:39] your last time you're going through
[22:40] training
[22:41] you have four classes to get better so I
[22:45] got hurt in May had to come back in
[22:47] January from a broken kneecap all kind
[22:48] of crap stress fracture is totally
[22:51] jacked up
[22:52] so how I did it I actually came back
[22:56] stress factions don't heal really well
[22:58] so I got through my third hell week and
[23:01] my third class and in that hell week we
[23:04] had a guy die of pulmonary edema
[23:06] it was one of the coldest hell weeks on
[23:08] the planet is is they freeze your butt
[23:10] off and usually you get done freezing
[23:12] and they try to warm you up in this
[23:14] particular hell week it just continued
[23:17] and continued to rain so we never got
[23:19] warm he ended up dying Wednesday night a
[23:22] pulmonary edema
[23:23] so when I got through with hell week my
[23:26] stress fractures were so bad and I
[23:29] realized I can't go through track like I
[23:31] need to get rolled again I'm broken
[23:33] and he's like no more rolls and I
[23:35] remember that so at this whole week I
[23:37] said to myself man I can't even walk I
[23:39] was on crutches again but after hell we
[23:41] could get walk week and after walk we
[23:43] could have 20 more weeks of getting your
[23:44] butt kicked so I had a plan my plan was
[23:48] to show up at 3 30 in the morning
[23:50] put my black sock on go on my dive cage
[23:53] and get duct tape and I would literally
[23:56] cast my feet up to me in my calf
[23:59] and for the first 40 minutes of the run
[24:01] that it would I have a pressure so I
[24:04] still have them now pressure ulcers
[24:05] they're not healed up but you can see
[24:07] the scars from deflection of the joint
[24:11] so basically how so what I did was I
[24:13] pretty much cast my ankle up my shin so
[24:16] I wasn't doing this and activating those
[24:19] stress fractures so I ran on my hip
[24:21] flexors for the first 45 minutes the
[24:24] pain was so excruciating but then after
[24:26] that it was subside
[24:28] and I would be able to finish the day
[24:30] out the pain will come back
[24:32] so I get them with still training I gain
[24:35] the weight back I'm about 250 pounds and
[24:38] have you guys heard of the story Lone
[24:39] Survivor
[24:41] Marcus the trail is a great friend of
[24:43] mine we speak on the Patriot tour
[24:44] together
[24:46] um I went through buds training with
[24:47] Danny deese Michael Murphy ax and also
[24:50] Marcus Luttrell
[24:53] Marcus was the only guy that lived on
[24:54] this operation
[24:56] it it went bad qrf team came in quick
[24:59] reaction for his team came in of Navy
[25:00] SEALs they got blown up everybody died
[25:03] but Marcus the trail I was at Free Fall
[25:06] school with his twin brother Morgan
[25:07] Latrell who's also a Navy SEAL heard
[25:10] about it went home Googled
[25:13] ways to raise money Googled races all
[25:15] this other stuff but came up at 250
[25:18] hadn't put running shoes on over a year
[25:20] was a race called the badwater 135.
[25:23] where you run 135 miles in one day
[25:26] pretty much 48 hours
[25:28] and it's in Death Valley
[25:30] in summertime I didn't know anything
[25:32] about this crazy world
[25:34] I thought it was a stage race I thought
[25:36] you ran like 10 15 miles camped out
[25:38] barbecued and ran again
[25:41] so I called the race director up Chris
[25:43] Kaufman I said hey man I want to do this
[25:45] race to raise money he said have you ran
[25:47] 100 miles before I said what in the
[25:49] calendar year
[25:50] he said no in one day I call him up on a
[25:53] Wednesday
[25:54] and he says you don't have two more
[25:56] races to qualify for my bad water race
[25:58] and basically
[26:00] you have to run 100 miles in 24 hours
[26:02] the race right there in San Diego that
[26:05] Saturday was called the San Diego one
[26:06] day where you run around a one mile
[26:08] track for 24 hours
[26:11] haven't run into you know in basically a
[26:13] year I said hey I'm gonna do it I'm a
[26:15] Navy SEAL
[26:16] bad idea
[26:18] go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz
[26:21] crackers mildplex
[26:23] and um that's my nutrition people first
[26:26] 400 miles pretty stupid right I have my
[26:28] ex-wife out there with me she's crewing
[26:30] me I get to mile 70 we get to mile 70
[26:33] and you haven't run past 20 miles in
[26:36] your life and you sit down for the first
[26:37] time what do you think happens
[26:40] pretty jacked up right yeah
[26:42] well I'm looking at three of my ex-wife
[26:45] and
[26:47] I'm sitting there she's looking at me
[26:50] I'm looking at her and I said um it's
[26:53] I'm kind of making it very abbreviated
[26:55] in the book it's a lot more than this
[26:57] but I'm abbreviate it real quick I asked
[27:00] her if she loved me
[27:01] she said yes why I said come and take a
[27:04] [ __ ] on myself right now
[27:06] because I couldn't stand up because my
[27:08] blood pressure was all messed up start
[27:10] peeing blood down my leg
[27:11] she's a nurse so she's freaking out and
[27:15] there's one thing a black man never
[27:16] wants to hear ever
[27:18] she said you're starting to turn white
[27:24] so this is where the 40 rule comes in
[27:27] people worst shaped my entire life I've
[27:29] been through Ranger school of Delta
[27:30] Force election twice three hell weeks
[27:33] all this crap this is the worst pain
[27:35] I've ever been in to this day I'm 43
[27:38] years old right now to 21 years in the
[27:39] military I've done 60 Ultra races pull
[27:42] up records all kind of stuff this is the
[27:44] worst pain of my entire life to this day
[27:46] but this is what I had to realize one
[27:48] thing I had to break this humongous
[27:51] thing down to very small all I put in my
[27:54] mind was let's not quit yet I'm gonna
[27:57] quit but not yet
[27:59] so I sat there I can't stand up so let's
[28:02] get some nutrition
[28:03] all right I'm not dizzy anymore
[28:06] let me clean this crap off me okay I
[28:10] need some food I'm gonna quit after
[28:12] eating peanut butter and jelly sandwich
[28:14] all right but not yet
[28:16] let me see if I can stand up stand up
[28:19] maybe I'll quit let me see if I can walk
[28:20] to the car there's the car it's a one
[28:23] mile track I'll walk past the car I'm
[28:24] just gonna get back to the chair
[28:26] I'm not gonna quit yet I kept this
[28:28] mindset the whole time
[28:31] I ended up doing 30 more miles
[28:33] did 31 miles truthfully after that I did
[28:35] 101 miles in 19 hours if you're driving
[28:38] the car the car may say 130 miles an
[28:40] hour
[28:40] the factory puts a governor on it so it
[28:42] only go 91. so he's sitting there with a
[28:45] race somebody they have no Governor
[28:47] they're fine boom you can't because
[28:50] every time you get to 91 the car starts
[28:51] doing this it starts doing this
[28:54] we put a governor on our brain and the
[28:56] second we get to that Governor our
[28:58] bodies start doing this oh this sucks
[29:01] this is uncomfortable no no no no no
[29:03] let's go this way let's stop
[29:05] it starts giving you all these questions
[29:07] that we cannot answer if you can't
[29:09] answer the questions your brain is
[29:11] asking you you quit if you have the
[29:13] answers to those questions of why the
[29:16] hell am I out here and you give it a
[29:18] quick answer the brain starts shutting
[29:20] up because it knows why we're doing what
[29:22] we're doing I started figuring these
[29:24] things out in my life so we have this
[29:27] governor on our brain and how you start
[29:31] pushing past that Governor start
[29:32] realizing your brain has the Tactical
[29:35] advantage over you why
[29:37] because it knows your insecurities it
[29:39] knows when you're lying it knows your
[29:40] fears knows everything about you it
[29:43] whenever those things start like right
[29:44] now I'm scared to death up here why when
[29:47] I was in sixth grade I was in the play
[29:51] and I stood up for a whole bunch of
[29:52] white people that probably didn't you
[29:54] know I was being judged in my mind
[29:55] scared the [ __ ] out of me
[29:58] and I stuttered severely bad I knew I
[30:01] stuttered bad my line was this long it's
[30:03] like hello or some [ __ ]
[30:06] and I stood up for everybody I was like
[30:08] this
[30:09] and I walked off stage so when I walk up
[30:12] in front of the thousands but 1200
[30:14] people it's still there my mind's
[30:17] telling me Go
[30:18] run off the stage
[30:21] I have to tell my mind something
[30:22] different I had to remember my resume
[30:25] what I've been through that all of you
[30:28] in here are just as [ __ ] up as me we
[30:31] post our real life never on Instagram
[30:34] reports the life that we want to have
[30:36] out there
[30:37] that's not me anymore I'm gonna tell you
[30:39] exactly about me who I am that's how you
[30:41] get better that's how you fix yourself
[30:42] that's how you grow
[30:44] I'm gonna move on real quick to the very
[30:46] end of my story I could be up here for a
[30:47] long time I need some questions I did
[30:49] everything I talked about up here I ran
[30:51] 205 miles I ran 7 000 miles in 2007 to
[30:55] raise two million dollars for Special
[30:56] Operations Warrior Foundation
[31:00] thank you
[31:03] I did it all with a hole in my heart the
[31:07] size of a dime
[31:09] so basically
[31:10] I was sick as hell and I'd get into all
[31:12] of this once again all these stories in
[31:14] my book with all these takeaways that I
[31:15] have that you know I'm not a theorist
[31:17] people there's a bunch of people who are
[31:19] theorists who go to the library and stay
[31:21] the mind they study it in a book I
[31:24] studied it by being a practitioner
[31:26] I put my mind in hell
[31:28] and I realized how I was thinking and I
[31:31] figured out tools and tactics on how to
[31:33] get through it by being in it not by
[31:36] studying it by being in it and literally
[31:38] that's how I started callousing over you
[31:39] know how so I did what I did 67 000
[31:42] pull-ups in nine months and it calloused
[31:44] my hands
[31:45] it counts my hands real good to protect
[31:48] my hands against the bar I started
[31:50] learning how to callous my mind to
[31:52] callous over my victims mentality and
[31:54] that's what I did
[32:00] so back to the hole in my heart
[32:03] everything I talked about three hell
[32:05] weeks range of school running swimming I
[32:08] did triple Iron Mans I did all kind of
[32:10] crap
[32:11] and I got to about 33 34 years old I
[32:14] started being extremely sick when you
[32:16] have an ASD and so ASD is atrial septum
[32:19] defect a lot of us are born with a hole
[32:22] in our heart when we get to a certain
[32:23] age it closes mine was very large so
[32:26] basically the good blood would give it
[32:29] the bad blood so the oxygenated blood
[32:31] would be deoxygenated and I was so the
[32:34] bad blood was going through my body long
[32:35] story short and that's how I was doing
[32:37] everything
[32:38] and so they sent me to John Hopkins
[32:41] everybody studied my body they studied
[32:43] everything and one guy says you know
[32:45] what we can't find anything and how you
[32:47] did all this how are you able to do all
[32:48] this
[32:49] a head guy came in from MIT and he said
[32:53] you know how he did it
[32:59] [Applause]
[33:02] understand something people
[33:04] we are leaving a lot on the table
[33:07] my book is called can't hurt me why is
[33:10] it called can't hurt me life isn't fair
[33:14] we have to understand that
[33:16] it shouldn't be fair it's a trial ground
[33:18] it's a testing grounds built to make us
[33:19] harder it's built to make us as strong
[33:22] as we can to test us to drive us
[33:25] so mentality is the only thing that gets
[33:28] us through life
[33:29] I was an underdog we are all underdogs
[33:32] in life even the baddest person in the
[33:34] world is to think that way so you should
[33:36] always have I've never arrived mentality
[33:39] and there can't hurt me mentality
[33:41] doesn't matter where you come from the
[33:42] sewer or wherever you think you're from
[33:45] when I got out of the sewer I got to the
[33:47] road and looked around and said can't
[33:49] hurt me
[33:50] nothing should be able to hurt you if
[33:52] you believe that it starts to become
[33:54] true
[33:55] I pass it off to you I mean I
[33:58] think I'm kind of speechless again it's
[33:59] it's stuff like what are you asking
[34:03] um
[34:03] you know one of the things that that I'm
[34:06] curious about is along the way what
[34:08] inspired you to keep pushing yourself
[34:10] like
[34:12] you know you talked a little bit about
[34:14] the shifting point right you know but
[34:16] what was it what was the trigger what
[34:18] was the defining moment that made you
[34:21] say or what even what was the point that
[34:24] kept you saying that you wanted to go
[34:25] forward
[34:27] it was honestly I started shaving my
[34:29] head at a young age and I lied so much
[34:32] because I wanted everybody to like me I
[34:34] wanted to be accepted so badly so
[34:36] whatever you liked I liked I mean I
[34:38] liked it but just so you like me that's
[34:40] what I thought about so a period of time
[34:43] looking in that mirror every day you
[34:45] can't lie to yourself man that dirty
[34:46] bathroom mirror that
[34:48] with all that daggone toothpaste gum and
[34:50] whatever on it it's telling you the
[34:52] truth they said hey man you are a jacked
[34:54] up cat
[34:55] and a lot of us have this voice in our
[34:57] head
[34:58] we all know that voice in our head that
[35:00] tells us the truth every single day that
[35:02] we try to run away from that says we're
[35:03] scared of this let's go this way
[35:05] it started gnawing at me so horribly bad
[35:08] that it wouldn't allow me to live
[35:12] anymore
[35:13] without facing me
[35:15] I had to go back into dungeon so when I
[35:17] tell my story
[35:19] I tell on a very surface level
[35:22] I had to go down in the dungeon the
[35:23] sewer where my mind used to be at and
[35:26] talk to that guy
[35:27] because I I wanted to live my life in a
[35:31] way that when I died I was proud of
[35:33] myself I know what Pride felt like
[35:35] and if it took
[35:37] pushing myself to death I was willing to
[35:40] do that but I want to look in that
[35:41] mirror not impress anybody not money not
[35:44] fame not nothing I wanted to impress the
[35:46] guy in the daggone mirror and I worked
[35:48] endlessly and tirelessly to do that and
[35:51] it happened
[35:53] so what was would you say you know
[35:55] because a lot of times we talk about
[35:57] inspiration I say a lot of times
[35:59] motivation is temporary inspiration
[36:01] lasts forever right is and then there's
[36:04] a lot of words thrown around you've been
[36:06] on the speaker circuit a lot of people
[36:07] get up and they talk a lot of cliche
[36:09] words or sayings or one-liners a bunch
[36:12] of [ __ ] in
[36:14] if no one's putting the work and they
[36:16] they they're saying that going back to
[36:17] the Bungalows chill not with room
[36:19] service and [ __ ] yeah it's a bus it's a
[36:21] bunch of noise so what what would you
[36:23] say is your inspiration today and then
[36:27] the Curiosity that I have is what is
[36:29] your inspiration and how would you
[36:30] define leadership I mean you've come up
[36:32] through the military and right you had
[36:34] to find an opportunity to lead yourself
[36:36] at some point and I just think it's
[36:37] interesting because if you ask
[36:39] everybody in this audience what their
[36:41] definition of leadership is everyone's
[36:43] going to give you a little bit different
[36:44] answer a different perspective so I
[36:46] don't know I'm just curious that's
[36:47] something I'm just curious about well
[36:49] we'll do leadership first leadership is
[36:51] being
[36:52] very uncomfortable all the time it is
[36:55] holding yourself to such a standard that
[36:58] is almost Untouchable you may not have
[37:00] any friends you may have a a jacked up
[37:03] life maybe you have a jacked up marriage
[37:05] it's being unbalanced you've literally
[37:07] dedicated your life to a higher cause a
[37:09] higher purpose Beyond you and it takes
[37:12] that person in your life to understand
[37:14] your mission
[37:16] and it's totally Mission oriented it's
[37:18] that guy that's like okay let's say
[37:20] we're going to work out at five o'clock
[37:21] and I'm and I'm in charge I'm the leader
[37:24] my guys and my girls whoever it may be
[37:26] need to see me running to work at 3 30.
[37:29] I need to take every excuse that they
[37:31] may have away from them then you see me
[37:34] outworking them every day not trying to
[37:36] put them down but saying God man if he's
[37:38] doing this man so I'm not so when I tell
[37:40] you to do something you can't say no
[37:43] you realize [ __ ] he's getting after it
[37:46] every day I cannot say no to him he's
[37:49] leading by example
[37:51] so that's what it's all about it's about
[37:52] and people say lead by example it's it's
[37:55] so easy to say that man it's so easy to
[37:58] say that but to do that every day to
[37:59] wake up every day miserable and say God
[38:01] I don't want to do this anymore that's
[38:03] when you know your leader when you're at
[38:05] that point and you're saying yourself
[38:06] every night it's Groundhog's Day
[38:10] every single day you know
[38:12] I'm going back in the lab again man
[38:14] I'm going back in the lab every single
[38:16] day you know it's not going to end
[38:17] that's when you know you're being a
[38:19] leader when your life truly is in a it
[38:22] sucks
[38:23] [Laughter]
[38:26] it's just truth man respective being a
[38:28] leader is horrible
[38:30] it is I I did it for a lot of years man
[38:33] you have to set that bar even higher
[38:35] because you so you have to have some so
[38:37] you know for for people to look for
[38:39] people to reach yeah I mean and there's
[38:42] weight right there's responsibility we
[38:44] uh we have a another event we call
[38:46] leadership coaching Dynamics which
[38:48] we look at defining leadership and a lot
[38:50] of times there's a difference in
[38:51] somebody that's achieving versus leading
[38:54] right and um one of the things that
[38:55] we've defined on it is is accepting the
[38:57] responsibility and realizing that once
[39:00] you accept that responsibility it has
[39:02] weight everyone wants the recognition of
[39:04] a leader to be called a leader but not
[39:06] everybody wants to accept the
[39:08] responsibility of what that means so to
[39:10] speak and so that's
[39:11] kind of how we we
[39:14] I guess would phrase it in leadership
[39:16] coaching Dynamics people love scoring
[39:18] the touchdowns man but no one wants to
[39:19] be lineman right they get praised
[39:21] between a touchdowns that you know that
[39:23] line is doing all the work right yep
[39:25] yeah so what's
[39:26] um what's ins like what inspires you
[39:29] what inspires you right now today to
[39:31] keep moving forward to keep going like
[39:33] what you know because obviously you
[39:36] started setting crazy goals even after
[39:40] you accomplished something that was
[39:42] crazy they're doing it right so what is
[39:44] it that inspires you
[39:46] is you have to believe
[39:48] you are here on this Earth so what
[39:51] changed my whole mindset really
[39:52] I was thinking like why the hell did God
[39:54] put me here
[39:55] what am I doing here if you have that
[39:57] mentality you could be nothing you have
[39:59] to believe that you are here for a
[40:01] reason
[40:02] that there's some reason me getting beat
[40:05] up me getting torture me being bullied
[40:07] me being more North Foundation me having
[40:09] to figure all this [ __ ] out of my own
[40:11] figuring out this indestructible mental
[40:13] toolbox had to be for a reason
[40:17] and my reason I believe now I know for a
[40:20] fact was to unlock
[40:24] the code the human potential
[40:27] and for me to share that with people
[40:35] so if when you reflect back you talk
[40:37] about unlocking the code of human
[40:39] potential do you see that there is more
[40:41] oh on but this is the thing though
[40:44] it's easier said than done right
[40:47] on the other end of suffering
[40:49] is a life that many people don't know
[40:52] even exist it's a beautiful world
[40:53] because like like the 40 rule we all
[40:57] live in this world where our brains are
[40:59] keeping us in this box
[41:01] outside that box on the other Edge is
[41:04] suffering which is all the others of
[41:05] that 40 percent
[41:07] is a world that's endless of opportunity
[41:11] but we are afraid to go outside that box
[41:13] because in that box it's comfortable
[41:15] that's where all of our nice stuff you
[41:17] know that's where the nice four-lane
[41:19] highway is at I know where the restrooms
[41:21] are at I know the gas stations are at
[41:24] outside that box man God gives you a
[41:26] shovel
[41:27] it says Man start digging
[41:29] that's not fun but when you dig you dig
[41:32] your own path to all kind of stuff
[41:33] that's unknown and that's why I started
[41:35] realizing man like on the other end of
[41:37] this it's some beautiful stuff so I got
[41:40] outside my box and I was man 300 pounds
[41:42] now look at me I'm 185 pounds and on the
[41:45] other side of the box was all this stuff
[41:47] and I know it's over there until I
[41:49] climbed the wall and saw it so what wall
[41:51] are you climbing now
[41:53] man right now I've climbed a lot of
[41:55] walls there's no more walls anymore
[41:57] the reason why is because I know how to
[41:58] climb
[42:02] I was trying to figure out how to climb
[42:04] before
[42:05] I got all the right gear man I got the
[42:07] ropes I got the shoes I got the chalk I
[42:09] got the harnesses I'm good I'm not
[42:11] scared to climb anymore I go to the Rock
[42:14] hammered in
[42:15] I got my belay and I'm good to go so you
[42:18] got to figure out how to climb first and
[42:20] that's all we all have a different way
[42:21] of climbing I said there's a lot of
[42:23] books out there um mental toughness it's
[42:25] all crap why because it's a Cookie
[42:27] Cutter Way life isn't cookie cutter like
[42:30] 3.14 is pi
[42:33] it's how you figure out equations we're
[42:35] all different equations we all come from
[42:37] we all have a story
[42:38] we don't have to strengthen our mind to
[42:40] figure out our own equation once you
[42:41] figure out your own equation in life you
[42:44] can then start picking away and how to
[42:46] be better but you first have to figure
[42:48] out your equation in life once you
[42:49] figure that out man you can do anything
[42:50] you know I believe inherently everyone
[42:52] knows that they have more insight on
[42:54] them everybody wants more right
[42:56] um you know and we want to do more we
[42:58] want to achieve more but in order to do
[43:00] that we have to become more right and
[43:02] then we can then we have something to
[43:03] contribute you can't get what you don't
[43:05] have and I think that identifying is
[43:07] half the battle what what is holding you
[43:09] back you know what are those what did
[43:11] you call it false sense of reality is
[43:12] that that you're you're putting down but
[43:15] what would you suggest or recommend for
[43:17] anyone in here that they're on that
[43:19] Tipping Point of breaking through you
[43:21] know they're on that Tipping Point
[43:22] because right now we have this
[43:24] incredible environment where the energy
[43:25] is high people's mindsets right in the
[43:29] military you you are trained in
[43:30] environments that's why they tried to
[43:31] you know drown you and I remember last
[43:34] time you told a story of being put in
[43:36] like the black ocean right you know
[43:39] overnight but what would you suggest to
[43:42] them their path to their more their path
[43:45] to their better you know that's kind of
[43:46] like our entire Mantra as a company why
[43:49] we do what we do is to pursue better so
[43:51] we can Inspire other people to do the
[43:53] same but if we're not pursuing it right
[43:54] then we're not doing it
[43:56] um is what would you recommend for them
[43:58] when they go back into those
[44:00] environments of what to expect and you
[44:03] know what's maybe a tool that you would
[44:04] recommend for them to try on to see if
[44:06] it fits well the biggest thing well I
[44:09] like what you're saying because my big
[44:10] saying is motivation is crap
[44:12] right now a lot of you right now can be
[44:14] motivated as hell go out of here and
[44:15] like yeah I'm motivated but you said
[44:17] you're right without being driven or
[44:19] obsessed this motivation Fades and
[44:23] motivations at the all-time high when
[44:25] your bills are paid when your wife or
[44:27] husband is good and everything is good
[44:28] you're motivated it's that person all
[44:31] hell breaks loose and everything falls
[44:33] apart that says I still got to get it in
[44:36] and how you get to that point in life
[44:37] where I figured out it's so noisy right
[44:39] now this world is so noisy we we all
[44:42] walk around these phones computers
[44:44] the world is so fast
[44:47] we're not able to think the the most
[44:49] powerful weapon in the world
[44:52] we walk around with it it's our mind
[44:55] it's our brain
[44:56] you have to be able to go into a very
[44:58] dark place in your mind
[45:01] and figure who you are go back
[45:04] to what you want to do what's your
[45:06] purpose we can't figure our purpose out
[45:08] or why we're here or why we're even born
[45:10] or whatever because our it's so loud in
[45:13] their mind
[45:14] we don't have any quiet time with
[45:16] ourselves to sit back and say what do I
[45:17] really want there's so many different
[45:19] dialogues in our head that we can't
[45:21] think so my biggest thing is you have to
[45:24] be alone in a very dark place in your
[45:27] mind to think about what is important to
[45:28] you
[45:29] awesome and so
[45:31] kind of piggyback off that
[45:34] you spend a lot of time alone what is
[45:36] something that you learned about
[45:37] yourself through your process or your
[45:39] journey
[45:41] I learned I was leaving a lot on the
[45:43] table
[45:43] and that's what scares me the most
[45:45] I I'm I'm good now but what haunts me
[45:49] is that at 24 years old
[45:51] I was 300 pounds and if I didn't make a
[45:54] right turn
[45:55] if I decided to just give in to the
[45:57] feelings I had
[45:59] I would have died a three or four
[46:01] hundred pound man working some minimum
[46:04] wage job in my casket never knowing that
[46:09] I was this guy and with fear so I
[46:12] believe in God and what scares me the
[46:13] most is I believe that God
[46:16] in my own mind I'm a big visualization
[46:18] person so so what keeps me going is like
[46:20] visualizing it's not true but it helps
[46:22] me I believe that God had this big chart
[46:25] in heaven
[46:26] and when you get there if you earn your
[46:28] right to get there you get there in
[46:30] heaven and you get there let's say I
[46:31] walked about 300 pounds and God says hey
[46:34] man great job you made to heaven
[46:36] and he rips this page down from Brian
[46:39] Underwood and now it says David Goggins
[46:41] his chart he rips it down
[46:44] throws that paper to the side and he
[46:46] says look at this and I'm reading it I
[46:48] go what is this
[46:49] he goes how much do you weigh 300 pounds
[46:52] what did you do I was a pest control guy
[46:54] for 40 years
[46:56] he says this is what you were supposed
[46:57] to be
[47:01] you know what I'm saying
[47:04] 185 pound person
[47:07] be able to run 205 miles break the
[47:10] pull-up record motivate people energize
[47:12] people make them driven make him
[47:14] passionate make him find more
[47:18] so am I in heaven or in hell
[47:22] that's what motivates me
[47:27] it scares me also
[47:29] because I believe that we are all
[47:31] leaving a lot a lot on the table
[47:34] and now when I go to heaven when I want
[47:37] God to look at me and say is
[47:39] as you were living
[47:41] I'm the all-knowing man I had to get a
[47:45] damn marker out and write more as you
[47:48] were living
[47:49] you see what I'm saying
[47:51] I want to impress him
[47:54] that's what I'm here for
[47:56] I want to do the impossible
[47:58] [Applause]
[48:09] [Music]
[48:16] [Music]
[48:22] do the impossible
[48:24] [Applause]
[48:28] you know I heard a speaker uh when I was
[48:30] 20 years old in say something very
[48:33] similar and um I heard him speaking like
[48:36] it hit me like that hit me right and it
[48:38] hit everybody in here but that thought
[48:40] goes through everyone's mind at some
[48:42] point in time in their life if it
[48:43] doesn't I don't believe that they're
[48:45] alive right but he he talked about you
[48:48] know you're gonna go meet your maker one
[48:50] day and he's going to look at you and
[48:51] he's going to say I gave you all this
[48:53] potential what did you do with it like
[48:55] it's almost like an interview
[48:56] everybody's story does either harm or
[48:58] good to them
[49:01] you have to go back in there in that
[49:03] muck
[49:04] face that muck fix that because what
[49:07] happens is when I was a Navy still
[49:09] training my job one of my jobs was to
[49:11] train guys to get through Navy SEAL
[49:13] training
[49:15] and when I started realizing I was
[49:16] training these guys they were you know
[49:18] they were getting bigger stronger faster
[49:19] all this other stuff
[49:21] but they would still quit
[49:23] all I was doing was building bigger
[49:25] stronger faster quitters and I started
[49:27] down I was like what the hell am I doing
[49:29] wrong man
[49:30] I was changing all the external crap
[49:33] I wasn't going into the internal and
[49:36] changing what really matters
[49:38] so that's what that's what the first
[49:39] step is and I and I talk about a lot in
[49:41] my book about how like the steps about
[49:43] doing that man but the first step you
[49:45] have to do is face yourself and be
[49:47] accountable for what you're not
[49:50] so then you can be what you want to be
[49:52] but first face what you're not so I I
[49:54] like garyvee but I'm not tripling down
[49:56] on strengths I don't trip them down on
[49:58] weaknesses
[50:00] that's what I do
[50:02] that's
[50:05] um
[50:05] we use
[50:07] you like basketball oh yeah we talk
[50:10] basketball when we first met right uh
[50:13] yeah because you were good you wanted to
[50:14] go watch uh Trey yeah Trey young yeah
[50:17] yeah
[50:18] um you like Michael Jordan right he's a
[50:21] yep I met him when I was 12 years old
[50:22] yeah his energy like just being his like
[50:25] you could feel his I don't know at least
[50:27] I did when I when I met him but the
[50:29] thing that it's always unique about
[50:30] Michael Jordan we talk about this a lot
[50:31] at the events is that he could have
[50:33] become very complacent very casual
[50:35] whenever you know he became the scoring
[50:38] leader in the All-Star and um but for
[50:40] Michael his brain was not you know be
[50:43] the greatest in the game at that time
[50:44] it's can I be the greatest that's ever
[50:46] played the game so what he did is he
[50:48] went in the gym they said he couldn't
[50:50] play defense he started focusing when
[50:52] you say double down on your weakness I
[50:54] think this is what you mean he started
[50:56] focusing in on defense right and then
[50:59] two years later he's a defensive player
[51:00] of the year then they said well you
[51:01] can't shoot you know then the next year
[51:03] he shoots like 40 from three-point line
[51:06] um is that what you mean by exactly it's
[51:09] about so I hate the water
[51:11] hated the water and that was about being
[51:13] in that box
[51:15] if I didn't give her my fear of being
[51:16] you know a being in the water I'd never
[51:18] be sealed
[51:19] I'm gonna be up here right now I have no
[51:21] story to share about me saying okay
[51:23] ma'am I'm afraid the water
[51:25] and that's kind of shackling my mind
[51:28] is by facing those things that's how you
[51:30] open up different doors of your life
[51:32] because all these things that that we're
[51:34] afraid of the doors that can possibly
[51:37] lead you to a whole other world
[51:40] but we keep them shut for fear for
[51:42] insecurities and that's one thing about
[51:44] trip on down on your weaknesses so then
[51:47] those weaknesses end up becoming your
[51:49] strengths right y'all get that right
[51:52] very cool
[51:53] um
[51:54] quick question you know we talked about
[51:56] we talked about it backstage
[51:58] authenticity and I think that like
[52:00] authenticity his because judgment runs
[52:03] so rampant in the world right
[52:05] um and it's usually about the person
[52:07] that's judging rather than the person
[52:08] that they are judging but we talk about
[52:10] authenticity is
[52:12] it's almost like a buzzword now our
[52:14] cliche word in terms of oh yeah let's be
[52:18] authentic but what does authentic you
[52:20] know being be an authentic mean to you
[52:23] like what what is your views on
[52:25] authenticity and what is the power of
[52:28] being authentic it's the ultimate power
[52:30] to stand in front of a group of people
[52:31] and you all can ask me any question you
[52:33] want to and I answer it
[52:35] that right there is what's up about
[52:37] authenticity it's
[52:38] being able to know that your life is
[52:40] jacked up that we all come from a past
[52:42] that may you know maybe bad or good and
[52:44] to own it not to be ashamed of it
[52:47] to not to not be afraid for people to
[52:50] judge you
[52:51] you know not care other people think to
[52:54] be able to walk around your own skin and
[52:55] be so comfortable in it that you can
[52:57] write your whole life all the bad not
[53:00] the good
[53:01] all the bad on the billboard and walk
[53:03] around like this
[53:10] this is me man
[53:12] this is me that's authenticity to me and
[53:15] when you get to that point when you can
[53:17] walk around with those middle fingers up
[53:18] not really like being mean to people but
[53:21] saying Jasmine man this is it this is
[53:24] who I am but I'm fixing it I'm not just
[53:26] letting it this you know it's not
[53:28] defining who I am but that's a part of
[53:31] my life
[53:32] you know and it's just owning who you
[53:34] are and not being ashamed of it
[53:37] strong
[53:39] and um
[53:40] [Applause]
[53:42] you know
[53:43] I'm just curious like right now you have
[53:46] a lot of perspective that can bring
[53:47] value to everyone's life right because
[53:49] everyone's gone through something and
[53:51] you've got through the other side We're
[53:52] Not Fragile people and
[53:55] you know I always find it interesting to
[53:58] find what someone's grateful for as they
[54:01] look back so like gratitude you know as
[54:04] you're moving forward in your life what
[54:06] what are the things that you hold the
[54:08] deers from uh from a gratitude
[54:10] standpoint or a reflection standpoint
[54:13] honestly man it's the story I just told
[54:15] you all right now that is my dearest
[54:17] thing in my life like
[54:19] uh top five Publishing House came to me
[54:22] and wanted to buy my life story can't
[54:24] hurt me for three hundred thousand
[54:26] dollars
[54:27] and for a guy that makes you know in the
[54:30] military I made 70 grand my whole life
[54:32] they came to me
[54:34] eight months ago when I was writing my
[54:37] book and they said we're going to offer
[54:38] you as a first time offer 300 000 a lot
[54:41] of damn money
[54:43] and I was getting ready to send the
[54:44] contract
[54:46] and I sat there with my fiance and I was
[54:48] like
[54:49] I can't do it
[54:51] she said like you know this is a lot of
[54:54] damn money
[54:55] and I'm like uh I wouldn't sell my life
[54:58] for anything in the world what I did
[55:00] would overcame would I all the struggles
[55:02] all the trials and tribulations
[55:04] so I self-published turned the contract
[55:07] down self-published
[55:08] [Applause]
[55:18] pretty cool you know one thing that you
[55:19] said the last event that resonated with
[55:21] me is uh had to do with a book you know
[55:24] we have we talk about uh being a legend
[55:27] or leaving a legacy
[55:29] um you know when it's all said and done
[55:31] it's
[55:32] you were mentioning
[55:35] um the perspective of look you're
[55:37] writing your story right now right and
[55:39] you're the author of your story uh but
[55:41] you had a little bit of definition of
[55:43] one of the things that you want to do is
[55:45] make sure that when you finish your
[55:47] story if you gave it to someone that's
[55:49] right will it change their life forever
[55:52] that's right so my whole thing was
[55:55] I'm kind of far out and I think I'm a
[55:57] real deep thinker because I I use my
[56:00] mind to get over so many obstacles and
[56:02] as I was writing my book I started
[56:04] writing it a long time ago
[56:06] and my whole thing is let's say you're
[56:08] in the hospital bed and you're getting
[56:10] ready to die and somebody walks in the
[56:12] room
[56:12] and you don't know them they don't know
[56:14] you and you have one copy of your book
[56:17] and it's sitting right there on the
[56:18] table
[56:20] and you're taking your last breath and
[56:23] you're talking to this person you say to
[56:24] them
[56:26] I want you to read this book
[56:28] as you're dying
[56:30] think about this
[56:32] that book that you just wrote that woman
[56:35] man whatever reading that book would it
[56:38] change their life forever
[56:40] and if it's not changing your life
[56:41] forever you have to rewrite your book
[56:44] you gotta start rewriting it right now
[56:46] you've obviously I mean coming through
[56:48] the military you either had friends
[56:49] mentors acquaintances coaches
[56:53] um figures in your life that have helped
[56:56] you forge this toolbox or this mindset
[56:58] or people that you respect leadership
[57:00] that you've respected
[57:02] um what were qualities in them that
[57:05] you know that that inspired you or you
[57:08] know that helped you grow and those
[57:11] mentors or the or those coaches what
[57:13] would you say the significant factor was
[57:15] and the reason I'm asking this is
[57:16] because like in leadership coaching
[57:18] Dynamics at an event we do a lot of
[57:19] people believe that being likable is the
[57:23] key to you know leading people or being
[57:25] a cheerleader
[57:27] um but I'm just curious on how you would
[57:29] answer that question
[57:30] I don't respect a whole bunch of people
[57:33] but the few that I did respect are the
[57:35] people who were uncommon amongst
[57:37] uncommon people and what that means is
[57:39] those people who aren't afraid to stand
[57:40] alone
[57:41] those people who have morals values who
[57:43] did not go with if all you guys are
[57:46] going left it's that one person who say
[57:49] no let's not the right way I'm gonna go
[57:52] right who didn't follow the crowd that
[57:54] person who's not afraid of doing what
[57:56] they believe is right in their heart and
[57:59] not following someone else because
[58:00] someone else said let's go this way and
[58:02] they agree with everybody I don't like
[58:04] yes men or yes women if you're right
[58:06] you're right we're gonna follow you but
[58:08] like people who stand for something they
[58:10] believe in something and this is the way
[58:12] I'm going to go whether you like me or
[58:14] not and that's what it's about
[58:16] so
[58:17] so in your life is there a coach or a
[58:21] mentor that you interface with that you
[58:22] had a lot of respect for
[58:25] you know I I had several people but
[58:27] don't take this wrong
[58:28] I believe that we are our own hero
[58:32] and if you have a culture let's say
[58:34] right now you guys idolize me and then
[58:36] tomorrow I go outside and I have some
[58:39] kind of issue we could I can let you
[58:41] down I'm human
[58:43] all your mentors everybody you like
[58:45] we're human
[58:47] you got to put yourself on that pedestal
[58:49] hold yourself to a higher standard hold
[58:51] yourself accountable
[58:52] and then look up to yourself I'm not
[58:54] saying kiss your own ass
[58:56] but I'm saying hold yourself to a
[58:58] standard and look inside yourself and
[59:00] try to be the best you can be we start
[59:03] trying to mimic somebody else don't be
[59:05] them be you and that's the kind of my
[59:07] mindset

## Plain Text (for processing)

foreign so what I want to do is I want you all to help me welcome to the stage someone that I'm super proud and privileged to introduce you to um he's someone you might have heard a story you might not have but I can tell you right now that I know that you're going to gain a huge level of awareness and distinction from meeting him and I want to introduce you to our friend Mr David Goggins [Applause] we're an interesting species as a human being all of us know that we're designed for more designed for greatness and let me tell you why is because when we're in the presence of greatness we see a piece of ourselves in that in them when we see someone that's doing something that's extraordinary we identify ourselves in that that's why it makes the back of our hair on the neck stand up right and when we witness that it has nothing to do with Talent it has nothing to do with skill what resonates the most with us is when we see someone with heart that's overcoming to become they're doing what isn't as if it were how many of you see that when you see his story yes or no but for those that don't know your story because I saw probably I'd say 30 40 of the audience they don't know your story I don't do it justice I'm not going to attempt to do it um but Captain share with us you know David Goggins you know I mean who are you where did your story begin well I won't get too too deep I'll give you the quick you know Cliff No highlights I was born with a very abusive father um beat his army every day was an alcoholic I end up suffering with um toxic stress the last incident that happened in our family was my dad came home one night from work real drunk and when he got drunk he got real violent he um had me go in the room take all my clothes off this is very typical it's a typical day for our family and you know you have to do anything like major for him to beat your ass he whatever he just get mad and just beat you up so I was about eight years old and my dad had me go in the bedroom he was very tactical mind tactics had me lay on the bed 90 degree angles my butt was hanging off door shut so my back was facing the door and I waited there for 45 minutes he walked up and was beating me all over the place my mom saw it she walked in and it was one of the worst beans ever got she says something to him set him off she smacked you know he smacked her in the face knocked her out gathered by her hair if you actually down the stairs by her hair we ended up leaving Buffalo New York and we went to a small town in Brazil Indiana so at this time my mom's you know she did this for 17 years I did it for eight and her soul was taken by him I was all messed up had a horrible foundation and we moved to a place called Brazil Indiana Brazil Indiana was about 15 minutes from Center Point Center Point was Hub of the KKK at the time so it was about five black families we were one of them so coming from this Foundation from Buffalo New York and moving to this area it was horrible for me but when you're young you know being a young black kid with a bunch of whites wasn't that bad and like I said about five black families but I didn't realize I had a severe learning disability because like when I was growing up I never went to school my dad had us working the skating rink the family business he didn't believe in going to school so fast forward my my third grade year comes and I'm copying the whole time I'm cheating on every test because they want to put me in a special school we all know what special means you're about to be you know have a nice title on you for the rest of your life so when I heard this I started this cheating so when I got to my junior year in high school I had a third grade reading level my mom never saw a report card we lived in a seven dollar a month place we lived on government subsidized apartment food stamps all that good stuff and um around my when I was about 14 years old my mom met a guy so we moved from Brazil to Indianapolis Indiana he got murdered he got murdered we moved back to Indianapolis Indiana or my father Brazil Indiana by this time the kids were grown and when you're young they'll know black and white you're just David Goggins when you get in high school they start realizing you look a little different so I got my car my first car ever got was a brown citation I pull up to school leave it there all day come out of school spray paint on it was [ __ ] we're going to kill you so this went on from my sophomore year to my senior year but my junior year I was like I gotta get to hell out of Brazil Indiana and I was like I want to go in the Air Force I'd get out of here and they join the military so I went to the military and and the guy was like Hey you gotta take an ASVAB test having a third grade reading level I didn't know he had to take a test to get in the military so the as-baptist I sit down trying to take it and I got a 20 the first time so I went back home and got my best friend Johnny so I can copy off of him Johnny came in took the test he had test a I had test B so I couldn't cheat so long story short you get three chances to take this ASVAB test on the third chance I had six months to pretty much study for this test that's when my whole life got revealed to my mom she was always gone she didn't know I was flunking out of school she know I wasn't going to school because getting you know getting bullied getting called [ __ ] all this other stuff so I walk into my mom was going on we didn't have much money so she got me a tutor for one hour a week that cost 15 bucks so I had six months four hours a month to study and what the tutor realized was I can't retain anything from all the toxic stress I don't know if it's a learning disability or what I can't retain stuff my my mind was just messed up for my life so How I Learned was I had to get spiral notebooks and literally if I had a manual I had to write down every single word of the manual so it may take you an hour to learn would take me six or seven days to learn and just literally write it down so I didn't really retain it I just memorized it so I can go in my mind right now I remember page 71 look at the question and go okay that's what I saw that's how I remembered it and put it down so I ended up passing the test I passed the test go back get in the Air Force and I wanted to be Air Force para rescue men it's like a special operations guy and I didn't know that um blacks and water not so much I know this though so in Special Ops what gets everybody is the water you know and being that there's only one percent of all Special Operations that are black had no idea at 19 years old this was the case they give you this warning order so now I pass this ASVAB test I'm a senior in high school and I'm going through this warning order and it pushed up sit-ups pull-ups all this stuff and so I'm doing all this but the last page has swimming okay easy day I went to uh Barnes and Noble wherever I went I got a how-to book on swimming first page was easy float right so my black ass gets the water and I'm like okay it's cool I didn't know any of this [ __ ] all right so I get in the water and everything was literally I taught myself everything in my whole life so I get in the water and lay back I'm looking up and I long dark the bottom of the pool I'm gonna Obama pool literally walking like this looking up thinking what the hell so I can't even swim so I pushed off I grabbed the gun on the Lifeguard sees me comes over and says hey I've taught thousands of people how to swim I said okay great man it was okay look just relax just need to relax swimming is all about relaxing okay relax let me go long dark bomb the pool I come up he says man you're [ __ ] I said why man he goes well you're negative buoyant I know what that was I do now obviously native buoyancies you know pretty much you sink in the Diagon water you can't float so mostly white people out here can float seventy percent of African-Americans have heavier bone density therefore it's not too fun it's like throwing a cat in the [ __ ] water so basically I take the same mentality that I had to become this intelligent guy you all see today and I applied that yeah make me feel better that's it I'm lying I'm dumb as [ __ ] so anyway I took that same mentality and I applied it to you know swimming after several several months I can swim so now I go into pear Rescue Training get to the first day second day third day I'm kicking butt I'm doing great a few days into training they had the thing called water confidence this special thing was not in the warning order I know what this was basically what water Compass is they drowned your ass so they put 16 pound weight belts on you now I'm negative born already I think to the bound with just myself they put twin ladies on your back and the whole idea if you're supposed to go down to the deep end with all this crap on you have your feelings on your feet and there's a side of the pool you hit the bottom it you know so it's 10 foot you're supposed to bound up you can't swim up jump up get up and they say switch you kick your fins off your feet put them on your hands and this is all you can do to get up so I would literally get like this high and here's the water and here are my lips this is all I was getting for air so over this period of time like 12 more events and all these events are water confidence this is what kicks you out of Special Operations trades not swimming it's not cold water it's not yelling they try to drown you so basically this went off for six more weeks I didn't quit it went from 200 guys to about 25 guys I'm still in the class so here I am going through training I don't go to sleep for six weeks because I'm scared to death of the water this program is 10 weeks long after six weeks they thought well the guys in the program are going to go on through for the training because these guys are going to make it they're good to go Roger that so I went to the doctor we all went to the doctor for a nice huge long extensive medical test they drew blood on me three days later they got the results back the doc calls me in the office and says hey David you have sickle cell okay Sickle Cell for you I don't understand or know what it is it's a blood disease that when you get under stressful situations or whatever dehydration your blood will sickle when the sickles stroke heart attack sudden death all those great things that can happen to you so in that period of time I joined the Air Force 175 pounds came out at 297. we'll get to that in a second so they drew my blood and they kept me out of training for a week they didn't know if this Sickle Cell was going to kill me they have a lot of you know information about it so I'm sitting there so when you go from very uncomfortable to comfortable like I was now I wasn't in training I wasn't drowning you never want to go back to being uncomfortable again so I'm sitting there relaxing chilling out I'm thinking well man they're gonna kick me out of here I'm not going to quit though so this is good because I don't want to get back in the water ever again so I can leave training so this is my thought process the doc calls me in a week later I'm skipping down to the doc's office think I'm getting the hell out of here I'm not going to quit but they're kicking me out so that's good for me I'm walking the doctor's office he says Hey ma'am we're putting you back into training ah it's not good it's not good if I'm like okay let me see I've been here six weeks seven weeks three weeks left I can tough it out I'm walking back to my uh compound talking to the head of the school walking to the CEO of the school I said Hey sir they let me back in the train and he goes That's great he goes well you missed a week of training is a very important block of training you missed you have to start from day one but when you're insecure like I was and you're afraid of everything like I used to be you lie really fast because you don't want the person knowing that you're a punk so I sat there and I said you know what the doctor didn't know a whole bunch about sickle cell so I'm not comfortable going back into training the CEO bit off on it and I never quit but he gave me a medical out of pair rescue but you all know I quit then we'll go back in the water but I ain't tell anybody that for several years so in that time frame in four years that became 297 pounds very minimal education as you all know and I get a job spraying for cockroaches at Ecolab okay yeah it's a good job so I don't like cockroaches though so I'm making about a thousand dollars a month spraying for cockroaches and I'm working from 11 o'clock at night to seven o'clock in the morning this is for about six months in my nightly or so at seven o'clock in the morning I would go to Steak and Shake my last stop spray them down get a large chocolate milkshake go across the street to 7-Eleven get a box of mini donuts chocolate donuts because I had a 45 minute commute home I was depressed and food felt good so I'm driving home sipping my shake eating my Donuts chilling out listen to the radio I get home this day my routine was to get home walk in the door turn the TV on walk in the back start taking a shower this particular day the TV came on and they said world's toughest training Navy whatever get my towel which can barely fit me my ass was so big had a pinch it like this so I come back down I sit down all this [ __ ] this falls out so I'm watching TV and I'm like my God man those guys are [ __ ] nuts carrying boats and laws guys going through SEAL training and wet and Sandy getting cold Jack cameras not bubbles chafed up guys ringing the bell just quitting left and right at the end of the show this command officer comes up at graduation there's 22 guys that made it through and the command Officer says we live in the world we're meeting we're mediocrity is often rewarded these men did test mediocrity and I sat there and I had time to reflect back on my life being bullied coming from nothing learning disability messed up Foundation life isn't fair at all at all so what are you gonna do about it I knew that no one would come back to help me no one's going to Miracle me to be somebody special everybody that called me [ __ ] my dad my mom all my situations were on me now and solely on me so I had to start developing an indestructible mental toolbox so I sat there in that couch and I realized man I am a piece of [ __ ] and even though the world helped me get here my false reality helped me even more and listen to somebody else's dialogue further helped me get here so I sat there and I had this Bright Idea being torn 97 pounds to go be a Navy SEAL so the bright idea happens 297 I watched this show I finished my chocolate milkshake and I said I'm gonna be a Navy SEAL so now the next two weeks I'm calling these recruiters up and then you so these guys are used to getting studs that want to be a Navy SEAL not 297 pound fat guy so I'm calling the guys up hey man I'm gonna be a Navy SEAL Okay blah blah blah blah we get to the last question how much do you weigh 297 dial tone call somebody else this went on for two weeks so I called a guy named named Steven saljo last guy I was giving up Steven salger was so busy Navy recruiter said come on in I don't have time to talk to you so I'm driving in after work chocolate milkshake in hand I put my shake down he looks at me and says please don't tell me that you are David Goggins I said yeah man I got over here in my shirt Goggins he said yeah I'm being a smart ass and he goes man you're you know you're you're fat and you're black I said man you're an observant [ __ ] sorry I cussed a little bit because my life was hard so I wanna I don't want to water it down I'm real I'm real I got about five more customers before I get cut off though so I sit there he's laughing at me I'm looking at him with this straight up stoic face like look man I'm being serious so he humors me takes me back to the scale I step on the scale so I'm from the scale had a nice big chart it was a height weight chart so to get the Navy I could be six foot one in 191 pounds that was it I'm 297 he writes it down he goes man you're a big boy and he starts writing stuff down he gets these huge manuals out and brings him out you in the Air Force before yeah how many years four and a half he's doing all these figures calculating stuff up how old are you I'm 24 and a half years old Okay blah blah blah doing this next thing I know he goes hey the program the only program we can get you in to be a Navy SEAL is about to end in three months you have to drop 106 pounds in three months Roger that I got my chocolate milkshake and walked out so here I go I go back to work and I'm spraying for cockroaches the Ecolab and I'm chilling out and I'm like you know what man maybe I can just be the best Ecolab guy in the world and I was spraying for cockroaches and I never really looked for cockroach areas so I just spray them so there's these holes in the wall where you're supposed to find a hole in the kitchen is supposed to find a column and that goes along and it kind of flushes out the Cockroaches if you find the right column it's like it's Pay Dirt it's called the money spot so I had my wand in this place I'm talking but I can't talk about it because it's you know I signed a confidentiality agreement okay but it's called Old Country Buffet so I'm spraying for cockroaches and if that's filmed I'm killing you so I'm spraying for cockroaches and my brownie Falls because they have some good ass brownies so I pick up my Brownie and as I pick it up I felt stuff [Applause] and I'm I keep my head focused on the Browning and I'm thinking there's no way in hell I found that and as I'm bending over I had a big ass and my mom would put socks she was so socks in my ass in my and that ripped out and so I'm sitting as a bad time of life and I stayed in this position for a while and I put my hands down here and stuff this fall into my neck and I looked up at the tile and it's open and stuff this is crawling around and falling around I hit the money spot people all right so I give my canister real slow I'm trying to shake my shirt out I get my canister I take my mask off and I leave it there and I get in my car I start it up I sit there for a second and I drive home and I quit my job so yeah done [Applause] but now what am I gonna do your best broadcast to come when you're least motivated where's that come from it comes from basically I had to stop thinking normal I had to stop thinking normal I can no longer be a common man walking around doing common things but no one taught me this stuff it was like I had you know I paid a trainer to come train me Jenny Craig didn't come down and Miracle my ass none of this happened it was on me and that's the thing you have to realize everything you do you may have some support you may not but it's on you you have to make the decision whether you want to be a badass or whether you want just want to be mediocre and everything's okay but being a badass hurts real bad and that's why I didn't want to do it so over the next two and a half months you know boy with details I lost the weight I went back to the recruiter and I went to buds Navy still training and I was the only person in history or navy still trained to go through three hell weeks in one year hell week is 130 hours of continuous training and um starts on Sunday is on Friday you might get two hours of sleep and I did all that in one year why'd it do that in one year catch the chase again there was an old crusty commanding officer named captain Bowen Captain bone was old Vietnam vet this is his last tour Duty and he believed you know so over 70 years this train has been going on he believed no matter where you were at you will start from day one if you don't make it through so I get to Wednesday ruptured hernia back to day one week one gets my gets my second hell week I get through that hell week getting ready to start second phase break my kneecap roll back day one week one in my third hell week I'm standing there I have 16 stress fractures so I have 16 stress facts this is me and my first two week I believe so I have 16 stress fractures I'm on my crutches I'm looking at him and he says uh Goggins this is your last time you're going through training you have four classes to get better so I got hurt in May had to come back in January from a broken kneecap all kind of crap stress fracture is totally jacked up so how I did it I actually came back stress factions don't heal really well so I got through my third hell week and my third class and in that hell week we had a guy die of pulmonary edema it was one of the coldest hell weeks on the planet is is they freeze your butt off and usually you get done freezing and they try to warm you up in this particular hell week it just continued and continued to rain so we never got warm he ended up dying Wednesday night a pulmonary edema so when I got through with hell week my stress fractures were so bad and I realized I can't go through track like I need to get rolled again I'm broken and he's like no more rolls and I remember that so at this whole week I said to myself man I can't even walk I was on crutches again but after hell we could get walk week and after walk we could have 20 more weeks of getting your butt kicked so I had a plan my plan was to show up at 3 30 in the morning put my black sock on go on my dive cage and get duct tape and I would literally cast my feet up to me in my calf and for the first 40 minutes of the run that it would I have a pressure so I still have them now pressure ulcers they're not healed up but you can see the scars from deflection of the joint so basically how so what I did was I pretty much cast my ankle up my shin so I wasn't doing this and activating those stress fractures so I ran on my hip flexors for the first 45 minutes the pain was so excruciating but then after that it was subside and I would be able to finish the day out the pain will come back so I get them with still training I gain the weight back I'm about 250 pounds and have you guys heard of the story Lone Survivor Marcus the trail is a great friend of mine we speak on the Patriot tour together um I went through buds training with Danny deese Michael Murphy ax and also Marcus Luttrell Marcus was the only guy that lived on this operation it it went bad qrf team came in quick reaction for his team came in of Navy SEALs they got blown up everybody died but Marcus the trail I was at Free Fall school with his twin brother Morgan Latrell who's also a Navy SEAL heard about it went home Googled ways to raise money Googled races all this other stuff but came up at 250 hadn't put running shoes on over a year was a race called the badwater 135. where you run 135 miles in one day pretty much 48 hours and it's in Death Valley in summertime I didn't know anything about this crazy world I thought it was a stage race I thought you ran like 10 15 miles camped out barbecued and ran again so I called the race director up Chris Kaufman I said hey man I want to do this race to raise money he said have you ran 100 miles before I said what in the calendar year he said no in one day I call him up on a Wednesday and he says you don't have two more races to qualify for my bad water race and basically you have to run 100 miles in 24 hours the race right there in San Diego that Saturday was called the San Diego one day where you run around a one mile track for 24 hours haven't run into you know in basically a year I said hey I'm gonna do it I'm a Navy SEAL bad idea go to Walmart get a blue lawn chair Ritz crackers mildplex and um that's my nutrition people first 400 miles pretty stupid right I have my ex-wife out there with me she's crewing me I get to mile 70 we get to mile 70 and you haven't run past 20 miles in your life and you sit down for the first time what do you think happens pretty jacked up right yeah well I'm looking at three of my ex-wife and I'm sitting there she's looking at me I'm looking at her and I said um it's I'm kind of making it very abbreviated in the book it's a lot more than this but I'm abbreviate it real quick I asked her if she loved me she said yes why I said come and take a [ __ ] on myself right now because I couldn't stand up because my blood pressure was all messed up start peeing blood down my leg she's a nurse so she's freaking out and there's one thing a black man never wants to hear ever she said you're starting to turn white so this is where the 40 rule comes in people worst shaped my entire life I've been through Ranger school of Delta Force election twice three hell weeks all this crap this is the worst pain I've ever been in to this day I'm 43 years old right now to 21 years in the military I've done 60 Ultra races pull up records all kind of stuff this is the worst pain of my entire life to this day but this is what I had to realize one thing I had to break this humongous thing down to very small all I put in my mind was let's not quit yet I'm gonna quit but not yet so I sat there I can't stand up so let's get some nutrition all right I'm not dizzy anymore let me clean this crap off me okay I need some food I'm gonna quit after eating peanut butter and jelly sandwich all right but not yet let me see if I can stand up stand up maybe I'll quit let me see if I can walk to the car there's the car it's a one mile track I'll walk past the car I'm just gonna get back to the chair I'm not gonna quit yet I kept this mindset the whole time I ended up doing 30 more miles did 31 miles truthfully after that I did 101 miles in 19 hours if you're driving the car the car may say 130 miles an hour the factory puts a governor on it so it only go 91. so he's sitting there with a race somebody they have no Governor they're fine boom you can't because every time you get to 91 the car starts doing this it starts doing this we put a governor on our brain and the second we get to that Governor our bodies start doing this oh this sucks this is uncomfortable no no no no no let's go this way let's stop it starts giving you all these questions that we cannot answer if you can't answer the questions your brain is asking you you quit if you have the answers to those questions of why the hell am I out here and you give it a quick answer the brain starts shutting up because it knows why we're doing what we're doing I started figuring these things out in my life so we have this governor on our brain and how you start pushing past that Governor start realizing your brain has the Tactical advantage over you why because it knows your insecurities it knows when you're lying it knows your fears knows everything about you it whenever those things start like right now I'm scared to death up here why when I was in sixth grade I was in the play and I stood up for a whole bunch of white people that probably didn't you know I was being judged in my mind scared the [ __ ] out of me and I stuttered severely bad I knew I stuttered bad my line was this long it's like hello or some [ __ ] and I stood up for everybody I was like this and I walked off stage so when I walk up in front of the thousands but 1200 people it's still there my mind's telling me Go run off the stage I have to tell my mind something different I had to remember my resume what I've been through that all of you in here are just as [ __ ] up as me we post our real life never on Instagram reports the life that we want to have out there that's not me anymore I'm gonna tell you exactly about me who I am that's how you get better that's how you fix yourself that's how you grow I'm gonna move on real quick to the very end of my story I could be up here for a long time I need some questions I did everything I talked about up here I ran 205 miles I ran 7 000 miles in 2007 to raise two million dollars for Special Operations Warrior Foundation thank you I did it all with a hole in my heart the size of a dime so basically I was sick as hell and I'd get into all of this once again all these stories in my book with all these takeaways that I have that you know I'm not a theorist people there's a bunch of people who are theorists who go to the library and stay the mind they study it in a book I studied it by being a practitioner I put my mind in hell and I realized how I was thinking and I figured out tools and tactics on how to get through it by being in it not by studying it by being in it and literally that's how I started callousing over you know how so I did what I did 67 000 pull-ups in nine months and it calloused my hands it counts my hands real good to protect my hands against the bar I started learning how to callous my mind to callous over my victims mentality and that's what I did so back to the hole in my heart everything I talked about three hell weeks range of school running swimming I did triple Iron Mans I did all kind of crap and I got to about 33 34 years old I started being extremely sick when you have an ASD and so ASD is atrial septum defect a lot of us are born with a hole in our heart when we get to a certain age it closes mine was very large so basically the good blood would give it the bad blood so the oxygenated blood would be deoxygenated and I was so the bad blood was going through my body long story short and that's how I was doing everything and so they sent me to John Hopkins everybody studied my body they studied everything and one guy says you know what we can't find anything and how you did all this how are you able to do all this a head guy came in from MIT and he said you know how he did it [Applause] understand something people we are leaving a lot on the table my book is called can't hurt me why is it called can't hurt me life isn't fair we have to understand that it shouldn't be fair it's a trial ground it's a testing grounds built to make us harder it's built to make us as strong as we can to test us to drive us so mentality is the only thing that gets us through life I was an underdog we are all underdogs in life even the baddest person in the world is to think that way so you should always have I've never arrived mentality and there can't hurt me mentality doesn't matter where you come from the sewer or wherever you think you're from when I got out of the sewer I got to the road and looked around and said can't hurt me nothing should be able to hurt you if you believe that it starts to become true I pass it off to you I mean I think I'm kind of speechless again it's it's stuff like what are you asking um you know one of the things that that I'm curious about is along the way what inspired you to keep pushing yourself like you know you talked a little bit about the shifting point right you know but what was it what was the trigger what was the defining moment that made you say or what even what was the point that kept you saying that you wanted to go forward it was honestly I started shaving my head at a young age and I lied so much because I wanted everybody to like me I wanted to be accepted so badly so whatever you liked I liked I mean I liked it but just so you like me that's what I thought about so a period of time looking in that mirror every day you can't lie to yourself man that dirty bathroom mirror that with all that daggone toothpaste gum and whatever on it it's telling you the truth they said hey man you are a jacked up cat and a lot of us have this voice in our head we all know that voice in our head that tells us the truth every single day that we try to run away from that says we're scared of this let's go this way it started gnawing at me so horribly bad that it wouldn't allow me to live anymore without facing me I had to go back into dungeon so when I tell my story I tell on a very surface level I had to go down in the dungeon the sewer where my mind used to be at and talk to that guy because I I wanted to live my life in a way that when I died I was proud of myself I know what Pride felt like and if it took pushing myself to death I was willing to do that but I want to look in that mirror not impress anybody not money not fame not nothing I wanted to impress the guy in the daggone mirror and I worked endlessly and tirelessly to do that and it happened so what was would you say you know because a lot of times we talk about inspiration I say a lot of times motivation is temporary inspiration lasts forever right is and then there's a lot of words thrown around you've been on the speaker circuit a lot of people get up and they talk a lot of cliche words or sayings or one-liners a bunch of [ __ ] in if no one's putting the work and they they they're saying that going back to the Bungalows chill not with room service and [ __ ] yeah it's a bus it's a bunch of noise so what what would you say is your inspiration today and then the Curiosity that I have is what is your inspiration and how would you define leadership I mean you've come up through the military and right you had to find an opportunity to lead yourself at some point and I just think it's interesting because if you ask everybody in this audience what their definition of leadership is everyone's going to give you a little bit different answer a different perspective so I don't know I'm just curious that's something I'm just curious about well we'll do leadership first leadership is being very uncomfortable all the time it is holding yourself to such a standard that is almost Untouchable you may not have any friends you may have a a jacked up life maybe you have a jacked up marriage it's being unbalanced you've literally dedicated your life to a higher cause a higher purpose Beyond you and it takes that person in your life to understand your mission and it's totally Mission oriented it's that guy that's like okay let's say we're going to work out at five o'clock and I'm and I'm in charge I'm the leader my guys and my girls whoever it may be need to see me running to work at 3 30. I need to take every excuse that they may have away from them then you see me outworking them every day not trying to put them down but saying God man if he's doing this man so I'm not so when I tell you to do something you can't say no you realize [ __ ] he's getting after it every day I cannot say no to him he's leading by example so that's what it's all about it's about and people say lead by example it's it's so easy to say that man it's so easy to say that but to do that every day to wake up every day miserable and say God I don't want to do this anymore that's when you know your leader when you're at that point and you're saying yourself every night it's Groundhog's Day every single day you know I'm going back in the lab again man I'm going back in the lab every single day you know it's not going to end that's when you know you're being a leader when your life truly is in a it sucks [Laughter] it's just truth man respective being a leader is horrible it is I I did it for a lot of years man you have to set that bar even higher because you so you have to have some so you know for for people to look for people to reach yeah I mean and there's weight right there's responsibility we uh we have a another event we call leadership coaching Dynamics which we look at defining leadership and a lot of times there's a difference in somebody that's achieving versus leading right and um one of the things that we've defined on it is is accepting the responsibility and realizing that once you accept that responsibility it has weight everyone wants the recognition of a leader to be called a leader but not everybody wants to accept the responsibility of what that means so to speak and so that's kind of how we we I guess would phrase it in leadership coaching Dynamics people love scoring the touchdowns man but no one wants to be lineman right they get praised between a touchdowns that you know that line is doing all the work right yep yeah so what's um what's ins like what inspires you what inspires you right now today to keep moving forward to keep going like what you know because obviously you started setting crazy goals even after you accomplished something that was crazy they're doing it right so what is it that inspires you is you have to believe you are here on this Earth so what changed my whole mindset really I was thinking like why the hell did God put me here what am I doing here if you have that mentality you could be nothing you have to believe that you are here for a reason that there's some reason me getting beat up me getting torture me being bullied me being more North Foundation me having to figure all this [ __ ] out of my own figuring out this indestructible mental toolbox had to be for a reason and my reason I believe now I know for a fact was to unlock the code the human potential and for me to share that with people so if when you reflect back you talk about unlocking the code of human potential do you see that there is more oh on but this is the thing though it's easier said than done right on the other end of suffering is a life that many people don't know even exist it's a beautiful world because like like the 40 rule we all live in this world where our brains are keeping us in this box outside that box on the other Edge is suffering which is all the others of that 40 percent is a world that's endless of opportunity but we are afraid to go outside that box because in that box it's comfortable that's where all of our nice stuff you know that's where the nice four-lane highway is at I know where the restrooms are at I know the gas stations are at outside that box man God gives you a shovel it says Man start digging that's not fun but when you dig you dig your own path to all kind of stuff that's unknown and that's why I started realizing man like on the other end of this it's some beautiful stuff so I got outside my box and I was man 300 pounds now look at me I'm 185 pounds and on the other side of the box was all this stuff and I know it's over there until I climbed the wall and saw it so what wall are you climbing now man right now I've climbed a lot of walls there's no more walls anymore the reason why is because I know how to climb I was trying to figure out how to climb before I got all the right gear man I got the ropes I got the shoes I got the chalk I got the harnesses I'm good I'm not scared to climb anymore I go to the Rock hammered in I got my belay and I'm good to go so you got to figure out how to climb first and that's all we all have a different way of climbing I said there's a lot of books out there um mental toughness it's all crap why because it's a Cookie Cutter Way life isn't cookie cutter like 3.14 is pi it's how you figure out equations we're all different equations we all come from we all have a story we don't have to strengthen our mind to figure out our own equation once you figure out your own equation in life you can then start picking away and how to be better but you first have to figure out your equation in life once you figure that out man you can do anything you know I believe inherently everyone knows that they have more insight on them everybody wants more right um you know and we want to do more we want to achieve more but in order to do that we have to become more right and then we can then we have something to contribute you can't get what you don't have and I think that identifying is half the battle what what is holding you back you know what are those what did you call it false sense of reality is that that you're you're putting down but what would you suggest or recommend for anyone in here that they're on that Tipping Point of breaking through you know they're on that Tipping Point because right now we have this incredible environment where the energy is high people's mindsets right in the military you you are trained in environments that's why they tried to you know drown you and I remember last time you told a story of being put in like the black ocean right you know overnight but what would you suggest to them their path to their more their path to their better you know that's kind of like our entire Mantra as a company why we do what we do is to pursue better so we can Inspire other people to do the same but if we're not pursuing it right then we're not doing it um is what would you recommend for them when they go back into those environments of what to expect and you know what's maybe a tool that you would recommend for them to try on to see if it fits well the biggest thing well I like what you're saying because my big saying is motivation is crap right now a lot of you right now can be motivated as hell go out of here and like yeah I'm motivated but you said you're right without being driven or obsessed this motivation Fades and motivations at the all-time high when your bills are paid when your wife or husband is good and everything is good you're motivated it's that person all hell breaks loose and everything falls apart that says I still got to get it in and how you get to that point in life where I figured out it's so noisy right now this world is so noisy we we all walk around these phones computers the world is so fast we're not able to think the the most powerful weapon in the world we walk around with it it's our mind it's our brain you have to be able to go into a very dark place in your mind and figure who you are go back to what you want to do what's your purpose we can't figure our purpose out or why we're here or why we're even born or whatever because our it's so loud in their mind we don't have any quiet time with ourselves to sit back and say what do I really want there's so many different dialogues in our head that we can't think so my biggest thing is you have to be alone in a very dark place in your mind to think about what is important to you awesome and so kind of piggyback off that you spend a lot of time alone what is something that you learned about yourself through your process or your journey I learned I was leaving a lot on the table and that's what scares me the most I I'm I'm good now but what haunts me is that at 24 years old I was 300 pounds and if I didn't make a right turn if I decided to just give in to the feelings I had I would have died a three or four hundred pound man working some minimum wage job in my casket never knowing that I was this guy and with fear so I believe in God and what scares me the most is I believe that God in my own mind I'm a big visualization person so so what keeps me going is like visualizing it's not true but it helps me I believe that God had this big chart in heaven and when you get there if you earn your right to get there you get there in heaven and you get there let's say I walked about 300 pounds and God says hey man great job you made to heaven and he rips this page down from Brian Underwood and now it says David Goggins his chart he rips it down throws that paper to the side and he says look at this and I'm reading it I go what is this he goes how much do you weigh 300 pounds what did you do I was a pest control guy for 40 years he says this is what you were supposed to be you know what I'm saying 185 pound person be able to run 205 miles break the pull-up record motivate people energize people make them driven make him passionate make him find more so am I in heaven or in hell that's what motivates me it scares me also because I believe that we are all leaving a lot a lot on the table and now when I go to heaven when I want God to look at me and say is as you were living I'm the all-knowing man I had to get a damn marker out and write more as you were living you see what I'm saying I want to impress him that's what I'm here for I want to do the impossible [Applause] [Music] [Music] do the impossible [Applause] you know I heard a speaker uh when I was 20 years old in say something very similar and um I heard him speaking like it hit me like that hit me right and it hit everybody in here but that thought goes through everyone's mind at some point in time in their life if it doesn't I don't believe that they're alive right but he he talked about you know you're gonna go meet your maker one day and he's going to look at you and he's going to say I gave you all this potential what did you do with it like it's almost like an interview everybody's story does either harm or good to them you have to go back in there in that muck face that muck fix that because what happens is when I was a Navy still training my job one of my jobs was to train guys to get through Navy SEAL training and when I started realizing I was training these guys they were you know they were getting bigger stronger faster all this other stuff but they would still quit all I was doing was building bigger stronger faster quitters and I started down I was like what the hell am I doing wrong man I was changing all the external crap I wasn't going into the internal and changing what really matters so that's what that's what the first step is and I and I talk about a lot in my book about how like the steps about doing that man but the first step you have to do is face yourself and be accountable for what you're not so then you can be what you want to be but first face what you're not so I I like garyvee but I'm not tripling down on strengths I don't trip them down on weaknesses that's what I do that's um we use you like basketball oh yeah we talk basketball when we first met right uh yeah because you were good you wanted to go watch uh Trey yeah Trey young yeah yeah um you like Michael Jordan right he's a yep I met him when I was 12 years old yeah his energy like just being his like you could feel his I don't know at least I did when I when I met him but the thing that it's always unique about Michael Jordan we talk about this a lot at the events is that he could have become very complacent very casual whenever you know he became the scoring leader in the All-Star and um but for Michael his brain was not you know be the greatest in the game at that time it's can I be the greatest that's ever played the game so what he did is he went in the gym they said he couldn't play defense he started focusing when you say double down on your weakness I think this is what you mean he started focusing in on defense right and then two years later he's a defensive player of the year then they said well you can't shoot you know then the next year he shoots like 40 from three-point line um is that what you mean by exactly it's about so I hate the water hated the water and that was about being in that box if I didn't give her my fear of being you know a being in the water I'd never be sealed I'm gonna be up here right now I have no story to share about me saying okay ma'am I'm afraid the water and that's kind of shackling my mind is by facing those things that's how you open up different doors of your life because all these things that that we're afraid of the doors that can possibly lead you to a whole other world but we keep them shut for fear for insecurities and that's one thing about trip on down on your weaknesses so then those weaknesses end up becoming your strengths right y'all get that right very cool um quick question you know we talked about we talked about it backstage authenticity and I think that like authenticity his because judgment runs so rampant in the world right um and it's usually about the person that's judging rather than the person that they are judging but we talk about authenticity is it's almost like a buzzword now our cliche word in terms of oh yeah let's be authentic but what does authentic you know being be an authentic mean to you like what what is your views on authenticity and what is the power of being authentic it's the ultimate power to stand in front of a group of people and you all can ask me any question you want to and I answer it that right there is what's up about authenticity it's being able to know that your life is jacked up that we all come from a past that may you know maybe bad or good and to own it not to be ashamed of it to not to not be afraid for people to judge you you know not care other people think to be able to walk around your own skin and be so comfortable in it that you can write your whole life all the bad not the good all the bad on the billboard and walk around like this this is me man this is me that's authenticity to me and when you get to that point when you can walk around with those middle fingers up not really like being mean to people but saying Jasmine man this is it this is who I am but I'm fixing it I'm not just letting it this you know it's not defining who I am but that's a part of my life you know and it's just owning who you are and not being ashamed of it strong and um [Applause] you know I'm just curious like right now you have a lot of perspective that can bring value to everyone's life right because everyone's gone through something and you've got through the other side We're Not Fragile people and you know I always find it interesting to find what someone's grateful for as they look back so like gratitude you know as you're moving forward in your life what what are the things that you hold the deers from uh from a gratitude standpoint or a reflection standpoint honestly man it's the story I just told you all right now that is my dearest thing in my life like uh top five Publishing House came to me and wanted to buy my life story can't hurt me for three hundred thousand dollars and for a guy that makes you know in the military I made 70 grand my whole life they came to me eight months ago when I was writing my book and they said we're going to offer you as a first time offer 300 000 a lot of damn money and I was getting ready to send the contract and I sat there with my fiance and I was like I can't do it she said like you know this is a lot of damn money and I'm like uh I wouldn't sell my life for anything in the world what I did would overcame would I all the struggles all the trials and tribulations so I self-published turned the contract down self-published [Applause] pretty cool you know one thing that you said the last event that resonated with me is uh had to do with a book you know we have we talk about uh being a legend or leaving a legacy um you know when it's all said and done it's you were mentioning um the perspective of look you're writing your story right now right and you're the author of your story uh but you had a little bit of definition of one of the things that you want to do is make sure that when you finish your story if you gave it to someone that's right will it change their life forever that's right so my whole thing was I'm kind of far out and I think I'm a real deep thinker because I I use my mind to get over so many obstacles and as I was writing my book I started writing it a long time ago and my whole thing is let's say you're in the hospital bed and you're getting ready to die and somebody walks in the room and you don't know them they don't know you and you have one copy of your book and it's sitting right there on the table and you're taking your last breath and you're talking to this person you say to them I want you to read this book as you're dying think about this that book that you just wrote that woman man whatever reading that book would it change their life forever and if it's not changing your life forever you have to rewrite your book you gotta start rewriting it right now you've obviously I mean coming through the military you either had friends mentors acquaintances coaches um figures in your life that have helped you forge this toolbox or this mindset or people that you respect leadership that you've respected um what were qualities in them that you know that that inspired you or you know that helped you grow and those mentors or the or those coaches what would you say the significant factor was and the reason I'm asking this is because like in leadership coaching Dynamics at an event we do a lot of people believe that being likable is the key to you know leading people or being a cheerleader um but I'm just curious on how you would answer that question I don't respect a whole bunch of people but the few that I did respect are the people who were uncommon amongst uncommon people and what that means is those people who aren't afraid to stand alone those people who have morals values who did not go with if all you guys are going left it's that one person who say no let's not the right way I'm gonna go right who didn't follow the crowd that person who's not afraid of doing what they believe is right in their heart and not following someone else because someone else said let's go this way and they agree with everybody I don't like yes men or yes women if you're right you're right we're gonna follow you but like people who stand for something they believe in something and this is the way I'm going to go whether you like me or not and that's what it's about so so in your life is there a coach or a mentor that you interface with that you had a lot of respect for you know I I had several people but don't take this wrong I believe that we are our own hero and if you have a culture let's say right now you guys idolize me and then tomorrow I go outside and I have some kind of issue we could I can let you down I'm human all your mentors everybody you like we're human you got to put yourself on that pedestal hold yourself to a higher standard hold yourself accountable and then look up to yourself I'm not saying kiss your own ass but I'm saying hold yourself to a standard and look inside yourself and try to be the best you can be we start trying to mimic somebody else don't be them be you and that's the kind of my mindset foreign
