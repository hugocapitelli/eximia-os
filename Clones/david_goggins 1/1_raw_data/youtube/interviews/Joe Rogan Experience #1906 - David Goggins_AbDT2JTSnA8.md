[00:39] good to get a reset cuz I come back in
[00:41] guns blazing like I really I don't I
[00:44] don't risk any mental burnout when I do
[00:46] it well I have resets but my resets are
[00:49] like um I call them Aid stations mental
[00:51] Aid stations so when you're going
[00:54] [ __ ] hard and you're grind all the
[00:55] [ __ ] time like everybody knows you're
[00:58] 24 hours in the day but I'm in the
[01:00] shower it's a mental aid station I don't
[01:02] think about [ __ ] I don't [ __ ] think
[01:04] about people I don't think about work I
[01:06] don't think about running I don't think
[01:07] about working out I'm in the car another
[01:10] [ __ ] mental aid station when I'm
[01:12] [ __ ] eating mental aid station so
[01:15] people EA and they work and all sort
[01:17] [ __ ] man so I I can grind hard because a
[01:20] lot of times I'm in mental [ __ ] a
[01:22] stations chilling so you have little
[01:24] mini vacations mini vacations man all
[01:26] day long all day long do you feel now
[01:30] almost a
[01:31] responsibility to like stay at it all
[01:34] the time cuz so many people are watching
[01:36] and paying attention and drawing
[01:37] inspiration from you 100% I mean like I
[01:41] probably would have retired a long time
[01:42] ago but I get these emails from people
[01:46] and it's like they're living through me
[01:50] like their strength comes through what
[01:53] they know I'm doing so there's so many
[01:55] times I want to get up and say oh man
[01:57] [ __ ] it I got mine I'm good and I'm like
[02:00] [ __ ] [ __ ] Tommy out there
[02:03] [ __ ] [ __ ] Tommy talking about
[02:05] tomm in his email Tommy talking about
[02:07] [ __ ] saved his life man I ran 10
[02:09] miles last night because of you man I'm
[02:11] like you know a lot of people can live
[02:13] off of that and they can [ __ ] be good
[02:14] with that and you know a lot of
[02:16] motivational people come out here man
[02:18] and run their [ __ ] mouths about
[02:20] [ __ ] and I know they are not doing [ __ ]
[02:23] they sit back and they're [ __ ] like
[02:25] you know they have their little
[02:26] brainstorming sessions about oh what
[02:29] should we say
[02:30] what's going what's going to connect
[02:31] with people while they're sing their
[02:33] [ __ ] ass my brainstorming sessions is
[02:36] [ __ ] out there in the [ __ ] grip of
[02:38] life [ __ ] grinding and that's where
[02:40] the all my material comes from the suck
[02:43] every bit of it comes from the
[02:45] suck and that's the difference between
[02:48] there's a there's like a whole industry
[02:50] now that's dedicated to trying to help
[02:52] people get motivated and a lot of the
[02:54] people that are involved in that are
[02:56] very unqualified 100% cuz they're not
[02:59] really doing anything no there's so many
[03:00] people that haven't actually done
[03:02] anything but they'll try to teach you
[03:05] how to get your life in order and how to
[03:07] get your mind right and develop that
[03:09] Warrior mentality i'm like [ __ ] you
[03:10] don't have that well they're utilizing
[03:12] the weakness of the world right now yeah
[03:14] the world's in a very bad place so the
[03:17] PE these these people who are like K
[03:19] artists they sit back and say oh I can
[03:22] come up with this I can come up with
[03:23] this and this right here probably make
[03:24] me some money yeah so they're in it for
[03:27] for for [ __ ] up reasons this just not
[03:29] a whole lot of people like you you you
[03:31] know I love that phrase uncommon amongst
[03:35] uncommon men cuz it's it's such a good
[03:37] phrase because it just shows you you
[03:40] you've been on this path for so long and
[03:43] you're grinding for so long but you're
[03:46] also honest about there's moments where
[03:48] you don't want to [ __ ] do this oh
[03:51] which is why it's so interesting because
[03:54] you do it right you you do it without
[03:57] any reservation you just go through it
[04:00] right but you always talk about I don't
[04:01] want to [ __ ] do this [ __ ] but you
[04:03] always do it but that's what people need
[04:05] to hear because they feel like that
[04:07] somewhere out there there's some
[04:09] superhuman person who never feels
[04:11] Despair and doesn't have any there's
[04:15] there's
[04:16] no no hesitation so they feel like
[04:20] there's this person that's so different
[04:21] than them and so much stronger than them
[04:23] and doesn't ever have any
[04:27] procrastination and you're like that's
[04:28] not me
[04:30] no I love that phrase you told me once
[04:32] he goes sometimes I look at my [ __ ]
[04:33] shoes for half an hour AP put those
[04:35] [ __ ]
[04:36] on it's a true statement but but what I
[04:39] do though man is I I came with this
[04:41] thing called perform without purpose and
[04:44] so many people they need to have a 5k a
[04:47] 10K I need to have a a a course in front
[04:50] of me I need to have something in front
[04:52] of me for me get my [ __ ] ass up and
[04:54] do some [ __ ] and that used to be me and
[04:58] nowadays you know [ __ ] for past 20 some
[05:01] years I don't need [ __ ] purpose and
[05:03] people miss out on this man the purpose
[05:06] we're all looking for this golden
[05:07] purpose is it this is it that is it
[05:09] making money it is is it my family
[05:12] [ __ ] the purpose is you we
[05:14] forget that every [ __ ] day I wake up
[05:17] and I don't want to do some [ __ ] [ __ ]
[05:19] I'm like okay man do you want to be a
[05:20] [ __ ] today do you want to feel like a
[05:22] little [ __ ] do you want to walk around
[05:23] all day knowing that you could but you
[05:25] didn't so I I it's performed without
[05:28] purpose you you have to learn how to get
[05:31] up and do [ __ ] when you ain't got no
[05:32] [ __ ] 5K no 10K nothing nothing exists
[05:36] your life [ __ ] sucks you're in the
[05:38] [ __ ] dungeon but guess what
[05:40] [ __ ] I'm still going to get it
[05:43] because when that time comes cu the time
[05:45] is going to come when that purpose is
[05:48] there you'll be ready but most of us
[05:50] [ __ ] aren't ready because we don't
[05:51] know how to do without having the golden
[05:54] carrot in front of us yeah and so you're
[05:57] all [ __ ] there's also this thing where
[05:59] if you do it once it's over you get a
[06:01] break oh like that's what a 10K is
[06:04] that's what a marathon is I'm going to
[06:05] train for this marathon and you're
[06:07] you're training and you're training for
[06:08] that big day but you're also recognizing
[06:10] when that marathon's
[06:11] over that's right that's right and as
[06:14] you get better at that H moment the all
[06:17] moment becomes less and less so my all
[06:20] moments now are like oh I ran today I
[06:22] went to the gym today I did this and
[06:24] this today I studied
[06:25] today I have about eight hours off in
[06:28] those eight hours are glorious to me and
[06:31] every day you go back out and you start
[06:33] earning that and every day you wake up
[06:35] it sucks and when it's over you feel
[06:37] better it sucks you feel better and as
[06:40] you get going as every step you take in
[06:42] that Journey as you're like for me run I
[06:45] run every day [ __ ] hate it but every
[06:47] step I take I'm like all right
[06:49] [ __ ] you're beating the demon
[06:51] again you run every day but I don't
[06:52] think people understand how [ __ ] up
[06:55] your knees are no you you you run when
[06:58] you sent me that x-ray after your
[07:02] surgery and I looked at what they did to
[07:04] your knee and and I looked at what it
[07:08] looks like right what the actual bone on
[07:10] bone looks like and how it had distorted
[07:14] because there's no cushioning at all no
[07:16] and the doctor said to you I can't even
[07:19] believe you could [ __ ] walk on these
[07:20] knees yeah forget about run thousands of
[07:22] miles so you're doing this every day in
[07:25] constant pain right right what is it
[07:28] like well I don't suggest explain your
[07:30] knees first of all so okay so PE people
[07:34] think that my knees are bad from a lot
[07:36] of running and they're wrong I'm I
[07:39] wasn't born healthy I wasn't born with
[07:41] some great body alignment some great you
[07:43] know I have sickle cell I have all kind
[07:45] of [ __ ] I have all kind of health issues
[07:47] you know all kind of I'm I'm [ __ ] up
[07:50] so I had a choice to make and the choice
[07:53] was you know growing up you know okay
[07:55] this hurts that hurts we can just sit
[07:57] down and do nothing or we can see how
[08:00] far we can push the human body so on
[08:03] that Journey as I started getting more
[08:05] and more into my mind and start
[08:06] realizing that while what I'm capable of
[08:09] doing my mind got stronger so the so the
[08:12] pain in my knees while it sucked I've
[08:15] been doing it for so long it was like it
[08:18] became my new Norm like okay my knees
[08:20] hurt [ __ ] it stop you know and I and I
[08:24] call like um stop feeling sorry for
[08:25] yourself but you sometimes have to
[08:27] ignore your feelings I'm Ming Jamie a
[08:29] picture you KNE oh no do I I I think
[08:32] Jamie has some uh do you have a picture
[08:34] of his KNE Jamie did I ever show send it
[08:36] to you
[08:37] Jamie I have it here hold on let me just
[08:41] but keep going no so it's like for for
[08:44] me I I made decision and my decision was
[08:46] to be the best person I could and I
[08:51] basically a lot of mornings I wake up
[08:53] and say [ __ ] your
[08:54] feelings and that doesn't mean like you
[08:57] know don't take it literally [ __ ] your
[08:59] feelings
[09:00] but sometimes you have to go beyond what
[09:02] you're feeling and my knees were [ __ ]
[09:04] but guess what I wanted to run and I
[09:06] knew that okay you can get knee
[09:07] Replacements this and that like I said
[09:09] it wasn't because of I Ran too much
[09:11] people always want to say oh man you ran
[09:13] so much so you [ __ ] up your body you
[09:14] know you don't want to be like David
[09:16] Goggins I hear all the time you w't be
[09:18] like David Goggins but so there's your
[09:20] name yeah there it is look look at the
[09:23] fact that there's zero space between
[09:26] those bones yes sir from the top from
[09:28] your your your tibia to your femur
[09:31] there's zero space it's just
[09:34] kneecap covering two bones that are
[09:37] rubbing against each other and
[09:39] so this was after surgery where they had
[09:43] to cut your
[09:44] knee slice your shin like in half and
[09:48] then take a chunk out of it because it
[09:50] had deformed so much from you running
[09:53] with bone on bone that it was starting
[09:55] to like swell out in One Direction and
[09:58] it was changing the alignment of your
[10:00] leg right this happened back in 2000
[10:03] 2001 I was going through buds so this
[10:06] happened for a long this is this right
[10:07] here has been going on for a long time
[10:10] so and it got to a point where it's like
[10:12] okay I'm done and that's the pl that's
[10:16] in there right now so as you see the
[10:18] wedge that part right there in the bone
[10:20] that's opened up yeah so they had to cut
[10:22] it realign it and then um now the uh
[10:26] alignment is better but this is now
[10:28] about 17 months ago 17 18 months ago
[10:30] when this happened so couldn't I get
[10:33] some screws that fit go back to that
[10:35] real quick
[10:36] real the one sticks right out of the
[10:39] [ __ ] bone hey cut that [ __ ] off yeah
[10:42] that [ __ ] down is that thing sticking
[10:43] into your leg no I don't well I feel the
[10:45] plate every single time I move yeah so
[10:48] every time so because it's like
[10:49] connected to the hamstring so whenever I
[10:53] [ __ ] whenever I move that plate is
[10:56] very irritating so every step even like
[10:59] when I walk when I run it's just it's a
[11:00] very irritating thing and then you got
[11:02] to wait for so long for that leg to
[11:05] start getting back into place and if you
[11:07] see that other picture I sent of the
[11:10] foam my my foam leg that I put my hand
[11:13] in I think Jennifer sent it to you Jamie
[11:16] with the foam leg you'll see this in a
[11:17] second this is [ __ ] up so like the
[11:19] swelling in that leg was [ __ ] nuts oh
[11:23] when you had EMA yeah you showed it to
[11:24] me in Vegas you you were sticking your
[11:27] thumb into your sh I grabbed it yeah
[11:29] yeah so it was it was pretty nuts but um
[11:32] you know once again it's just things you
[11:33] uh things I was willing to endure to get
[11:37] it right
[11:38] there so that's just all post surgery
[11:42] swelling yeah so when the doctor said
[11:46] this to you and he he said look this is
[11:48] how [ __ ] up your knee is did he say
[11:51] you need a replacement what what was he
[11:52] saying basically I had two options so I
[11:55] went to the first guy had the surgery
[11:56] done that's in the book I talked about
[11:58] that but then the second guy so after
[12:00] the first surgery I was done so this is
[12:02] the first surgery after buds no so this
[12:05] is like back in uh looking at 2000 so me
[12:09] and Cameron this is recently so I didn't
[12:12] have any surgery going through buds
[12:14] really I didn't have any surgery at all
[12:16] so I went through in 2001 I [ __ ] up 20
[12:20] 2001 whatever it was I messed up my leg
[12:21] real bad and hell we kept on going on it
[12:23] just kept on going kept what did you do
[12:25] to it in how week it was like I I [ __ ]
[12:28] it up somehow like running or whatever I
[12:29] Happ it it can't hurt me but um it was
[12:32] uh I think the boat I fell it twisted
[12:36] but over a period of time it's got worse
[12:37] and worse and worse so I was getting
[12:38] like Tor all shots every day and then
[12:41] just got worse but I'm like [ __ ] it I'm
[12:43] good so I kept going on it so it kind of
[12:44] healed all [ __ ] up so this kept going
[12:47] kept going kept going years later years
[12:50] later just kept going on it so I stopped
[12:52] squatting so it became like okay my
[12:54] knee's [ __ ] up my align is messed up
[12:56] my hips are messed up I can't squat so
[12:58] but I still run it's okay I started
[13:01] running cuz running doesn't require you
[13:03] to bend down and [ __ ] so I'm running a
[13:05] lot and it got to um 20 years later
[13:08] pretty much and it was
[13:10] 2020 or i g get this right camon Haynes
[13:14] came down we went for a 20 mile run my
[13:17] knees were [ __ ] up for like 10 years
[13:19] long story short it was like okay man I
[13:22] got to get this thing looked at so when
[13:24] got looked at the doc was like oh we can
[13:26] go in there and just do a quick little
[13:28] [ __ ] you know cleanup job and the
[13:31] cleanup job went so quick guy was
[13:33] breaking tools and [ __ ] [ __ ] up like
[13:36] literally broke tools and I have it in
[13:38] there he he was breaking tools I talked
[13:39] to him I know he told me your meniscus
[13:42] was the hardest meniscus he's ever
[13:44] experienced in his life he's like dude
[13:46] he goes I didn't know that miniscus
[13:48] could get that way he goes like he's not
[13:51] human he goes when I was cutting into
[13:53] meniscus it broke the scalpel yep Wolf's
[13:56] lost and Joie said Wolf's lost something
[13:58] yeah yeah he said normally when you cut
[14:01] in meniscus it just slices right through
[14:03] like butter he's like I couldn't cut it
[14:06] yeah might went butter I went butter so
[14:08] all those [ __ ] who think I went
[14:09] putting them 100 while weeks go [ __ ]
[14:11] yourself [ __ ] you don't get no [ __ ]
[14:13] like that baby i s on the [ __ ] couch
[14:16] no I mean that's the craziest thing I've
[14:17] ever heard like you've hardened your
[14:19] meniscus just through constant pressure
[14:21] and pounding yeah so he went in there to
[14:23] clean it up and then what happened so
[14:25] basically that little meniscus that
[14:28] whatever the [ __ ] was in there so my so
[14:29] my alignment was so bad the only thing
[14:33] that was keeping me able to do anything
[14:36] was that little [ __ ] up messed up um
[14:39] meniscus it was all Jarred up and jacked
[14:42] up but the second that thing got out
[14:45] dude it was like I was have you seen
[14:47] Star Wars those those storm thing those
[14:49] those those those big [ __ ] um things
[14:51] that what they called um they have
[14:55] wobbly legs when they hit like logs
[14:57] robot things yeah robot things that's
[14:59] how my leg was it was it had nothing it
[15:02] was just like a little dangling [ __ ]
[15:05] like so from my knee down the shin the
[15:07] tip FIB it just dangled like there was
[15:11] nothing and I was like okay man this so
[15:14] was worse after the cleanup much worse
[15:17] like I was done I went from running 200
[15:19] M to I I did 240 mile race in in 20120
[15:23] October 2020 it was Moab went out there
[15:27] got second place 6 2 hours knee was
[15:29] [ __ ] up getting it drained before the
[15:31] [ __ ] race but I still ran 240 miles
[15:33] literally 5 or 6 days before the race
[15:36] I'm getting it drained and it was a
[15:38] baseball siiz [ __ ] um it's called a
[15:40] baker's assist so they drained it and I
[15:44] went in there did the race finished it
[15:46] and I was like okay here we go went on
[15:48] to do some more races I did like another
[15:49] 200 mile did a couple more races and
[15:51] then like I said cam came down but after
[15:54] that I went and got this surgery done
[15:56] and I went from running every day to now
[15:58] I have some [ __ ] leg that just
[16:00] dangles and after that surgery it just
[16:03] [ __ ] dangled I was like okay man I'm
[16:04] [ __ ] and just from that little piece
[16:06] of manessa just that little piece of
[16:07] meniscus and I'm sitting there thinking
[16:08] okay man this is not this doesn't make
[16:11] any sense to me this there's something
[16:13] [ __ ] I don't understand why I can't I
[16:15] can't put any pressure on my leg the the
[16:18] amount of blood they were taking out was
[16:20] was unbelievable so there's the blood
[16:22] right there Jesus Christ that's the
[16:24] blood dude oh my god there one two three
[16:26] four five you see the black blood yeah
[16:29] that is deoxygenated blood so whatever
[16:32] was going on whatever the [ __ ] was going
[16:34] on that's why it looks different color
[16:36] so the red blood is the the blood that
[16:38] has oxygen right and that was just like
[16:40] coagulated [ __ ] up blood yep Jesus
[16:45] yeah so that so after surgery I'm like
[16:47] I'm like seven seven days out or
[16:48] whatever the [ __ ] it was and once again
[16:51] I don't know the exact times but I have
[16:53] them in the book I have everything
[16:54] [ __ ] dialed in um I went back I was
[16:57] like man I'm I'm [ __ ] up I mean it's a
[16:59] simple miniscus surgery man like people

[17:11] literally getting my knee drained every
[17:13] week getting PRP I'm like man but in the
[17:16] back of my mind I I know how far I can

[17:26] this is wrong I go I'm never gonna run
[17:28] again
[17:29] I'm never going to run again I walk with

[17:32] six months so I had the surgery done in
[17:36] February it was uh February March April
[17:39] May
[17:40] June about four months four months after
[17:43] surgery four or five months I'm like hey
[17:46] Jennifer um I gotta find another you
[17:49] know somebody else look at my [ __ ]
[17:50] knee so I try to keep my [ __ ] together
[17:52] but imagine when you go from every day
[17:54] of your [ __ ] life grinding and you go
[17:57] to nothing mhm like literally like
[18:00] 90minut surgery done that's crazy that
[18:03] it was just a little meniscus scope 90
[18:05] minute surgery done and I was like okay
[18:08] man this is anyway so I found this guy
[18:11] named Dr Gamal out of New York and we
[18:14] fly there but I'm like he can't fix this
[18:17] man because I knew it was a lot more
[18:19] than knes it was just it was all kind of
[18:21] this [ __ ] up body [ __ ] and I walk in
[18:24] the office and he decides to see me and
[18:27] me and Jennifer in there Jennifer's
[18:28] happy
[18:29] she's happy as [ __ ] it's like oh my God
[18:31] man this guy's going to be able to get
[18:33] you a a [ __ ] miniscus replacement he
[18:35] he was all kind of Guru out but I'm a
[18:38] realist bro I will push myself and I
[18:41] will go as far as I can but I also am a
[18:44] realist I also knew in the back of my
[18:46] mind I'm not gonna try to ruin your
[18:47] [ __ ] party Jennifer this what I'm
[18:48] saying myself but this shit's done it's
[18:51] over so but I went just to pretty much
[18:55] appease her and just see you know if
[18:57] there anything left so walk in the
[18:59] office and the doctor's like uh yeah I'm
[19:01] looking at your X-rays and that's the
[19:02] Doctor Who's like I don't know how this
[19:04] is one the Dr Gamal look him up world
[19:07] renowned [ __ ] dude and when this
[19:10] guy looked at me straight-faced he said
[19:13] man I don't know how you did
[19:15] anything with those knes anything let
[19:18] alone run 200 miles back to back 240
[19:21] miles what the [ __ ] you did I don't know
[19:23] how you did it and so I'm like okay
[19:25] whatever can we get it fixed and he
[19:28] didn't want to get get there cuz he knew
[19:30] I was [ __ ] he's like no you know we we
[19:32] can maybe you know try an in un loader
[19:35] brace maybe an un loader brace will help
[19:37] you out and I was like what's an
[19:38] unloaded brace so basically my knee went
[19:41] in on the miniscus side on the inside so
[19:43] it was like jamming in the inside so
[19:45] this brace kind of like it kind of helps
[19:47] realign the knee a little bit so then
[19:49] you cannot have so much pressure on the
[19:51] inside of your leg so that's it right
[19:53] there one side yeah so basically I'm
[19:56] like man I'm like okay I'm not
[19:59] so this is all you have for me I'm like
[20:01] you can't do [ __ ] for me and he was like
[20:04] um no and he was walking out of the
[20:07] office and he could tell I was like I
[20:09] wasn't too [ __ ] up but I was like CU I
[20:12] kind of was preparing myself for the
[20:13] next part of my journey I don't like to
[20:15] lay in my [ __ ] too long you I give
[20:17] myself a couple minutes okay
[20:19] [ __ ] we gota man the [ __ ] up we
[20:21] gotta get back in this [ __ ] like
[20:22] what's next you know let's go let's go
[20:24] see you know let's let's go back to
[20:26] college let's let's do something because
[20:27] you're you're running and you're let
[20:28] Chris done so he got to the door he
[20:32] opened it and as he was literally he was
[20:35] shouldered out the [ __ ] door
[20:37] and I'm looking at Jennifer I'm like
[20:39] well you know we'll go back to [ __ ]
[20:41] you know go back to Nevada and [ __ ]
[20:43] start again and he was
[20:45] like try the unloaded brace out and
[20:49] there's one more thing we could possibly
[20:51] do for you and I'm like [ __ ]
[20:55] like get your little monkey [ __ ] ass
[20:56] back in here bro like what is is it like
[20:59] like like what the [ __ ] going on so he
[21:01] was like yeah there's this surgery
[21:03] called
[21:04] HTO and he was like you can go in we can
[21:07] [ __ ] you know pretty much break your
[21:09] tibia it's called high tibia osteotomy
[21:12] they go in and they break your tibia
[21:15] they they they like slice into it and
[21:18] they they wedge it to the point where
[21:20] they realign your leg back up it's a
[21:23] very painful surgery it's very painful
[21:25] afterwards painful as [ __ ] afterwards
[21:28] and they put that plate the plate you
[21:30] saw back on and then your leg is so so
[21:34] your knee is still where it was because
[21:36] this doesn't get fixed so it takes
[21:38] several months for that knee to start
[21:40] working it way back into where that
[21:42] alignment is so now my leg is just now
[21:45] so here it is you see it on the image
[21:47] yeah so they they take a slice out of it
[21:50] because it's deformed yep and that slice
[21:53] lowers the part that's deformed and
[21:55] tries to make it a more natural shape
[21:58] but you're still dealing with bone on
[22:01] bone so you're still deal you're still
[22:04] dealing with the pain of arthritis
[22:06] essentially cuz do you have any
[22:08] cartilage in your knees not much not
[22:11] much at all if any so the thing about it
[22:13] it takes that pressure off of that so it
[22:16] was complete bone on bone right what
[22:18] that surgery does is it takes it over to
[22:21] the lateral side so on the outside so I
[22:23] I have a nice meniscus over there that
[22:26] thing wasn't touched for years because
[22:27] how I was born all the pressure was on
[22:30] the uh my um medal meniscus so your knee
[22:33] had been misaligned your whole life
[22:35] whole life that's what yeah that's my
[22:36] whole life has been [ __ ] up so my
[22:39] Meniscus on my lateral side is
[22:42] pristine so now the way he did it is
[22:45] that all of my pressure is going on to
[22:47] that pristine miniscus okay so now it's
[22:50] all about getting that leg back aligned
[22:53] which is taken forever and it's still
[22:55] not aligned it's getting there it's
[22:57] getting there yeah it's getting there
[22:58] cuz M was so [ __ ] up can they do a
[23:00] meniscus replacement on you no so that's
[23:03] what I wanted to get done but if your
[23:05] knee is so far gone like mine was there
[23:08] was no option for that why is that
[23:10] because my knee was so far gone so it
[23:12] would like when you put that meniscus in
[23:14] there however it works he said it
[23:15] wouldn't have taken it like basically it
[23:17] would have taken it but it would have
[23:18] [ __ ] destroyed it because your leg is
[23:19] so your knee is so [ __ ] up so this was
[23:21] the only option for me don't they make
[23:24] like an artificial meniscus now as well
[23:26] yep and this with this guy really is
[23:28] specializes in so he's he's like the guy
[23:31] to go to for that stuff what is an
[23:33] artificial meniscus consist of I guess
[23:35] it's just I have no idea I'm not even
[23:37] going to get into that [ __ ] see if we
[23:38] can find out what that is cu I got some
[23:40] [ __ ] up knees too not like yours
[23:43] though if I ever think about complaining
[23:44] I look at yours yes sir see world's
[23:47] first artificial meniscus available in
[23:49] Israel and there you go Andreas
[23:51] gal yeah there he is and so this it
[23:55] looks like some sort of a clear gel
[23:58] looking stuff and which is you know the
[24:01] the meniscus is just a cushioning in
[24:02] between the two bones and the cartilage
[24:05] and this is uh oh look at that
[24:08] yep
[24:10] H and but they can't do that to you no
[24:13] you have to be a good candidate for that
[24:14] so your knee has to be in a certain
[24:17] certain condition and mine was not in
[24:19] that condition it was it was F if if you
[24:21] were candidate for that would they be
[24:23] able to do it and you be able to run or
[24:25] is that just like to move around and
[24:26] walk from what I read about you can you
[24:28] can run you can do everything you want
[24:30] to do but sometimes if you do a lot it
[24:32] wears it out so you but you could get a
[24:34] new one get a new one yeah that's not
[24:36] that bad not that bad man for you it
[24:38] doesn't work no because basically it
[24:40] wouldn't even work for me because my
[24:42] knee was gone but the way he reshaped it
[24:46] wouldn't that correct I mean he kind of
[24:48] like changed your alignment of your knee
[24:50] and made it more normal I think it had
[24:53] he made it more normal but from what I
[24:56] understand um if you put that in there
[24:58] structurally like like structure-wise
[25:00] what what makes it more normal is the
[25:01] surgery he did so right now there's no
[25:05] bone on bone for me so there's no need
[25:07] for that meniscus at all so a lot of
[25:09] people get their meniscus taken out if
[25:12] you have the right alignment and your
[25:13] body can do what it's supposed to do
[25:14] really yeah but if you get your KNE your
[25:16] miniscus taken out you're just cartilage
[25:18] on cartilage if you know um Dwayne Wade
[25:21] Dwayne basketball player yeah I believe
[25:23] Dwayne Wade played years years if I'm
[25:27] correct with no meniscus yeah I I think
[25:30] in both his knees Jesus yeah years he
[25:34] had he end up having like really bad
[25:35] knee problems but his meniscus was
[25:37] messed up back in the day they used to
[25:39] take it out so if you look here here it
[25:42] is was in college wow surgery to remove
[25:45] the meniscus in his left knee 11 years
[25:47] ago while he was at Marquette led to
[25:49] ongoing knee problems he's had with
[25:51] Miami Heat I'm so glad that you have
[25:54] this [ __ ] thing to pull up Jamie
[25:55] because I would be talking out my ass
[25:57] half the damn time that's I do man you
[25:59] [ __ ] [ __ ] squar me away brother
[26:02] knees are a problem man yeah and the
[26:04] fact that you require your knees to do
[26:07] what you do like your your whole thing
[26:11] is endurance athlete right and to be an
[26:14] endurance athlete you got to be able to
[26:15] move your legs you got to be able to
[26:17] move them but what I like about and this
[26:19] was this was like literally a a trained
[26:21] skill for me was I'm I'm always
[26:24] preparing for like not being a [ __ ]
[26:29] like a lot of people get to a point like
[26:30] for instance like if Jennifer can't do
[26:33] something like if you know if if if she
[26:35] can't go for a run or whatever just like
[26:36] cuz she something's wrong like some
[26:39] simple [ __ ] it's G to bother her I got
[26:42] to a point in my life where I realize
[26:43] this is life and so I move on past
[26:46] things real quick so people like oh my
[26:47] God what are you gonna do David if you
[26:49] can't run [ __ ] I'll swim or I'll
[26:53] go to college or I'll do something else
[26:55] this like like this isn't my life so I'm
[26:58] I'm I'm I'm I'm very aware how quick
[27:01] life can take [ __ ] from you and I've
[27:04] always prepared my mind for the next
[27:06] chapter and what happened with me was I
[27:09] started this thing called front loading
[27:11] so when I was young I used to be a
[27:12] little piece of [ __ ] you know like
[27:14] [ __ ] oh I'm not good enough I can't
[27:15] do this I can't do that but the second I
[27:17] got my head out of my ass and I realized
[27:20] man you can achieve a lot of [ __ ] if you
[27:23] get off your ass and you start moving
[27:25] and you start motivating yourself start
[27:27] becoming a self motivator so I started
[27:28] front loading and front loing is people
[27:31] man you've done so much by 47 because I
[27:33] don't know what tomorrow is going to
[27:35] bring me so my my military resume is fat
[27:39] you know I [ __ ] did a lot in the
[27:40] military I did a lot outside the
[27:42] military I've I've I've made money I've
[27:45] I've I've done almost every race out
[27:47] there hard race in the world I've broken
[27:49] pull-up records I've done a lot of [ __ ]
[27:51] so when these bad times come and also
[27:54] not like like not only that like work
[27:55] your ass off so so you can enjoy yeah
[27:57] yeah you taking a shot
[27:58] you know you you may not live to be old
[28:01] but what if you do and you worked your
[28:03] ass off when you were able and you were
[28:06] able to [ __ ] get up early able to
[28:07] grind if you frontload it properly the
[28:11] back half of your [ __ ] life is money
[28:13] and that's what I did the second I
[28:15] realized that man you are a piece of
[28:17] [ __ ] we got to get going because at 47
[28:20] man you're not GNA be able to do any of
[28:21] this [ __ ] 50 whatever you are so I front
[28:24] loaded so all these bad things have
[28:26] happened to me I sit back man how are
[28:28] you handling this so well [ __ ]
[28:31] i' I've done it I front loaded I have
[28:33] the money I need I have the success I
[28:35] need I have the [ __ ] the the
[28:37] determination the willpower and also the
[28:38] pride in myself so when I wake up every
[28:40] morning I know who the [ __ ] I am I
[28:42] frontload it perfectly so I don't care
[28:44] what's taken from
[28:45] me but it's got to still there got to be
[28:49] a strange position to be in where your
[28:52] body is your medium the body is the
[28:54] vehicle for you to express yourself
[28:56] right and your body's breaking down mhm
[28:58] and I know that they considered doing
[29:01] knee Replacements on you too yep and
[29:03] what was that conversation like it was
[29:05] it was very basic man it's like hey you
[29:07] know you're you're not going to be able
[29:08] to do some of the [ __ ] that you've done
[29:09] even though obviously people are but
[29:12] that was a conversation and I know it
[29:15] sounds weird it was totally fine with me
[29:17] it was fine because I had dude people
[29:19] don't understand this this wasn't like a
[29:22] a part-time job man when you've done
[29:25] without like Kobe Bryant when Kobe [ __ ]
[29:28] retired at last game he like 60 points
[29:30] or some [ __ ] he walked off the court he
[29:32] didn't [ __ ] cry he said oh my God I'm
[29:34] going to miss the sport what the [ __ ] he
[29:35] walked off he gave he gave everything he
[29:38] could man when you [ __ ] give what
[29:41] I've given and [ __ ] like to say
[29:42] oh you [ __ ] you you don't [ __ ] know
[29:45] [ __ ] which makes me who I am I've given
[29:49] everything people make oh you you ran on

[29:59] somewhere to [ __ ] go I had somewhere
[30:01] to [ __ ] go and I got there and Buddy
[30:04] when [ __ ] tell you you can take
[30:05] a break now hey you're [ __ ] up as long
[30:09] as my knees are halfway worked I got to
[30:10] run you're telling me man may maybe
[30:12] chance I can't run no more H give me an
[30:16] excuse to [ __ ] not do [ __ ] but as
[30:17] long as I have no excuse I gotta do it
[30:19] but I I was I was happy where I was I
[30:21] gave everything I give everything to who
[30:23] I am and that's why I'm people I don't

[30:37] know exactly what I was doing I'm not a
[30:38] masochist I'm not crazy I'm not this and
[30:40] that people try to title me and label me
[30:43] no I had something to [ __ ] do well
[30:47] the way I describe it to people when
[30:48] people ask me like why does he do all
[30:50] these things like what is what is the
[30:51] motivation here I go he's on a mental
[30:54] Journey that very few people have ever
[30:58] been on because the what people don't
[31:01] understand you they or they
[31:03] misunderstand you or they purposely
[31:05] misinterpret the way you're living your
[31:07] life you're trying to understand your
[31:12] mind in a way that very few human beings
[31:16] ever get to understand their mind
[31:18] because you're taking your mind into
[31:21] these terrible Dark Places all the time
[31:25] and you're trying to pull things out of
[31:27] that you're trying to to learn things
[31:29] about yourself and about your potential
[31:31] from that that's exactly it and that's
[31:33] what people don't understand I studi the
[31:36] darkness you you find no [ __ ] answers
[31:39] in the light none it's too happy it's
[31:41] too nice and we're not we don't need to
[31:43] be taught how to live in happiness that
[31:46] that just comes naturally to us happy
[31:48] moments but the dark times man you can't
[31:50] and you can't get there unless you put
[31:52] yourself there life will take you there
[31:55] but when you get into those dark moments
[31:57] that's why people that's why people how
[31:58] are you able man I couldn't [ __ ] read
[32:00] and write to I was a junior in high
[32:01] school how are you able to write like
[32:03] this man
[32:06] [ __ ] I go to such places in my
[32:08] mind and I study the darkness like it's
[32:11] not just physical when I was growing up
[32:14] and I saw my mom getting beat and I got
[32:16] beat and I was some stuttering little
[32:18] black kid in allh school and I'm on

[32:41] get through this if we study it so every
[32:42] time I'm in a dark moment and life's
[32:45] [ __ ] up around me whether it be
[32:46] physical or just life I get in it man
[32:49] with a [ __ ] pen and paper I'm like

[33:20] don't give a [ __ ] man you can't for me I
[33:23] cannot help people there's a lot of
[33:25] cookie cutter [ __ ] out here in this
[33:26] world
[33:28] discipline wake up early take coach
[33:30] shower [ __ ] this [ __ ] that whatever it's
[33:33] all [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not but what
[33:37] they don't teach you within the cookie
[33:40] cutter is like our minds are like a
[33:42] [ __ ]
[33:43] garage and the garage if you open a
[33:46] garage and it's all cluttered up it's
[33:48] all [ __ ] up you can't put your car in
[33:49] there you got [ __ ] boats and you got
[33:51] [ __ ] kids toys and [ __ ] everywhere
[33:54] but if you organize that [ __ ] garage
[33:57] and you put everything rightful spot you
[33:59] can pull that car in there you can put
[34:00] two cars in there you can put bikes in
[34:01] there and that's like with the Mind
[34:03] people talk about discipline and [ __ ]
[34:06] determination and [ __ ] you know
[34:08] repetitions and all this [ __ ]
[34:11] consistency why people fall off the
[34:13] wagon so often is because their mind is
[34:16] full of [ __ ] there's no room in that
[34:19] mind for discipline there's no room for
[34:22] consistency they may do it once or twice
[34:24] but then the mind takes over in that
[34:26] cluttered [ __ ] garage
[34:28] comes in and then it's like a circuit
[34:30] breaker man a circuit breaker just
[34:32] overloads and it [ __ ] Sparks and our
[34:34] minds that's that's our mind man it's
[34:36] like a [ __ ] circuit breaker that so
[34:38] much [ __ ] in it you keep on loading it
[34:40] you can't put any more into it so I've I
[34:44] talk about it in there man so much about
[34:46] clearing space in your [ __ ] mind so
[34:49] then you have room for all those
[34:51] discipline waking up early taking those
[34:54] because they they they do mean something
[34:56] but we don't get to that [ __ ]
[34:58] dark matter that is keeping you from
[35:00] clearing out that mental
[35:02] garage that's a good way to put it
[35:05] because that is the mind of most people
[35:08] is filled with stuff that they have to
[35:10] move around to get to what they want and
[35:13] it's constantly piling up and there [ __ ]
[35:16] unorganized and organized mind man
[35:18] you're looking at the [ __ ] I got to
[35:19] take care of the kids the kids scals was
[35:21] all [ __ ] up my husband my my wife you
[35:23] know I'm I I [ __ ] I'm going by
[35:26] McDonald's to get this and I'm in my
[35:28] schedule everything's just [ __ ] I wish
[35:30] I was doing this but I'm doing that and
[35:32] that and this and I want a raise but I
[35:33] can't get one my boss an [ __ ] where's
[35:36] greatness in that man you can't you you
[35:38] can't fit discipline into that you can't
[35:41] fit structure you can't fit consistency
[35:43] you can't fit to grind and then when you
[35:45] try it just gets [ __ ] it gets [ __ ]
[35:49] overrun by the [ __ ] clutter in your
[35:51] [ __ ] up mental garage when you are in
[35:54] these dark places and you're Gathering
[35:57] up these
[35:58] lessons how difficult is it to try to
[36:02] bring that back and convey it to people
[36:06] when you're not in that space like when
[36:08] you're in that space when you're in the
[36:09] Moab 240 and you're going uphill and
[36:13] you're in the middle of the it's just
[36:15] deep suck right how do you convey where
[36:19] that mental fortitude comes from how do
[36:21] you bring that back it's almost like
[36:24] you've got something you can't even hold
[36:25] in your hand and you want to show it to
[36:27] people I take
[36:30] snapshots so every time I'm in a bad
[36:32] situation like you know I I study it and
[36:35] that's the only reason I do have to [ __ ]
[36:37] I do is I'm studying this [ __ ] because I
[36:39] know that I never thought I was G to be
[36:41] writing books and trying to help people
[36:44] get better but I'm I was always trying
[36:47] to do it because I knew I
[36:49] sucked and so when you know you're
[36:51] trying to get somewhere you know you
[36:52] suck you know that you you believe that
[36:54] you're a born
[36:55] loser you are taking snapshots man like
[36:57] you know you you see something on your
[36:59] phone like oh man I'm going to take a
[37:01] [ __ ] snapshot of that or how you do
[37:03] the little picture [ __ ] so you can save
[37:05] it on your phone I do that in my mind so
[37:07] I get in these moments I'm like [ __ ]
[37:09] okay wow that's some [ __ ] good
[37:11] knowledge right there man I snapshot it
[37:14] because I know that I can use that later
[37:16] I can I can I can use this because I'm
[37:17] not out there just I'm not most people
[37:20] they go out and they run and they go out
[37:22] and they do and they're like oh this is
[37:24] beautiful look at the [ __ ] Mountains
[37:25] and the [ __ ] and all this [ __ ] no I
[37:29] don't like it my body hurts I'm hurting
[37:31] how do we get through this and it's a
[37:33] [ __ ] it's a it's it's a lab it's my
[37:36] mental lab and I and so when I come home
[37:39] I'm not forgetting it and the second I
[37:41] every day I get done running every day I
[37:43] get through work and every day I get
[37:44] through studying whatever it is that
[37:46] brings me to that place of knowledge I
[37:48] come home and that book was mostly
[37:51] written on scratched piece of paper in
[37:53] hand so I come home from from running
[37:56] and I write everything out I write
[37:58] everything out all those things and as
[38:00] I'm running I'm talking about it so all
[38:03] these things that pop my head as I
[38:05] continue to run I'm going through it I'm
[38:08] I'm starting to layer it down I'm
[38:09] starting to break it down into okay that
[38:12] happened okay now now let's layer this
[38:14] because that's just not how it happened
[38:16] it just didn't happen that way what led
[38:18] up to this and so it becomes Me by
[38:21] myself in school I'm literally going to
[38:23] school right now and I'm learning so
[38:25] when I come home I write it out and and
[38:27] then I'm able to write out and I'm able
[38:28] to think about it and say okay oh this
[38:30] is good [ __ ] this is this will help me
[38:33] later on and then it becomes what it is
[38:36] now and when you try to convey it to
[38:40] people what what do you when when you're
[38:42] writing it out and when you're talking
[38:44] about it like what are you thinking are
[38:46] you thinking that this is going to get
[38:47] into someone's mind and this is going to
[38:49] help them motivate themselves are you
[38:50] just trying to express yourself and let
[38:53] them do with it what they
[38:54] can I'm them you're them I'm them I and
[38:59] the [ __ ] up thing about me why I'm
[39:01] able to do it the way I'm able to do it
[39:03] I'm not above them I was never above
[39:06] them a lot of people write where they
[39:08] are they write where they are oh yeah
[39:11] like [ __ ] you right now writing you
[39:14] have a good life man you have a [ __ ]
[39:16] good life I don't write from that place
[39:19] I write from the place that I am the the
[39:21] the the the place that created who I am
[39:24] I go back to that place I call going
[39:26] back to scratch
[39:27] I can't write about David goggin now
[39:30] David goggin now is a
[39:31] success people want to get to be to feel
[39:35] whatever success is for them they want
[39:37] to feel that so I can't write it here at
[39:40] David goggin successful I must write at
[39:42] David gogin [ __ ] man I'm a [ __ ] I
[39:45] don't feel good about myself and every
[39:48] day I go through that Journey so that's
[39:50] where it comes from it comes from
[39:52] scratch all that [ __ ] all my knowledge
[39:54] comes from going back to where the real
[39:58] growth growth doesn't happen when you
[40:00] make it so far in life you make it so
[40:01] high up the whatever it is whatever
[40:03] you're trying to be there's no more
[40:05] growth there's small growth but you
[40:09] remember back when you [ __ ] tried to
[40:10] become Joe Rogan you are now how much
[40:13] growth was in that tons of growth
[40:16] learning lessons learn so I go I always
[40:18] RIS that's why I'm a [ __ ] wildland
[40:20] firefighter now wh why I'm a [ __ ]
[40:22] smoke jumper I don't need to do that
[40:24] [ __ ] at all but I don't learn learn
[40:27] anything from where I'm at now there's
[40:29] no knowledge up here the knowledge is
[40:31] down there in the [ __ ] muck so that's
[40:33] where I write that's where I go back
[40:35] that's where I learn I always go back to
[40:36] school always go back to the basics I
[40:39] always go back to first
[40:41] grade and how much of that is tied to
[40:45] doing things physically though there's
[40:47] like there's a there's a certain kind of
[40:50] physical struggle that you go through
[40:51] particularly with what you excel at
[40:53] which is endurance athlete work when
[40:56] when there's a mental and physical thing
[41:00] that happens when the two of them are
[41:02] together it doesn't happen in anything
[41:03] else like you can do hard work hard
[41:06] mental work and it's very difficult and
[41:08] I'm sure you can learn a lot from that
[41:10] right but it doesn't have the physical
[41:13] pain that comes with the suck of
[41:16] endurance work yes there's nothing
[41:19] nothing in the world that you're able
[41:21] I'm able to get let's say I that Moab
[41:24] 240 I was in 62 hours
[41:27] [ __ ] sucked it's just with blown out
[41:31] knees blown out knees literally the a
[41:34] few days before the race I'm getting
[41:36] them drained Before the Race so that's
[41:41] in your [ __ ] mind man like it ain't
[41:43] like oh I show up to start like oh this
[41:44] is [ __ ] great I'm gonna [ __ ] have
[41:45] a good time out here no I'm thinking all
[41:48] right let's have my [ __ ] knees
[41:49] drained like I'm I'm in pain at Mile
[41:53] zero and that's in your brain I have 240
[41:56] miles of [ __ ] ahead of me and there's
[41:58] nothing in life nothing in life this is
[42:01] why I love Endurance Sports so much I
[42:03] love it and I hate it it's LoveHate
[42:05] relationship 62
[42:08] hours I equate that to [ __ ] seven
[42:11] years of
[42:13] life you can't get that man so what I
[42:16] know that Ultra does for me is it packs
[42:19] in it packs in I can't I can't live
[42:22] several
[42:24] lifetimes I can't see because the
[42:26] knowledge I need to gain for this life I
[42:28] live in today I need two or three or
[42:31] four lifetimes to be where I want to go
[42:34] Ultra gives it to me in [ __ ] high
[42:37] definition real fast 62 hours you go out
[42:40] there [ __ ] suffer you come back oh
[42:44] that was 62 hours I gained seven [ __ ]
[42:46] years of knowledge the ups and downs the
[42:49] pain The Suffering The the you you learn
[42:52] how to chunk the [ __ ] down like oh my
[42:55] God man I'm at Mile 100 how the [ __ ] am
[42:56] I get toor
[42:58] 118 everything becomes you you start to
[43:01] learn Life out there and you learn so
[43:04] much in such a condens period of time
[43:06] and nothing in the world can do it like
[43:09] pushing yourself to the absolute limit I
[43:12] I I caught like
[43:15] so people have talent people have a lot
[43:18] of
[43:19] talent and this is going beyond your
[43:22] talent so when Talent when there's no
[43:25] more Talent what happens happens to you
[43:28] most people
[43:29] quit people only go to their talent
[43:32] level and once their talent level is
[43:34] gone it becomes a mental game that that
[43:37] whole mental game sets in then and most
[43:40] people can only perform to their talent
[43:42] and they realize man why am I always
[43:43] messing up right here why why why is
[43:47] this like my big my big hurdle it's
[43:52] because you're performing to your
[43:54] talent and then after that your mind has
[43:58] nothing for
[43:59] you nothing for you I see I see Fighters
[44:03] I see Runners I see people who they're
[44:06] great but they get to the edge of their
[44:08] talent it's like [ __ ] man what what's
[44:12] what's up because you're now at the
[44:15] point now where you're talented could do
[44:17] [ __ ] for you my
[44:19] friend now it's the mental
[44:21] game and that's where people get lost in
[44:24] life get lost in that next level and
[44:26] that next level is found for me in the
[44:29] things that I do just misunderstood
[44:31] that's a giant problem with Fighters yep
[44:34] there's many fighters that are Elite
[44:36] level in the gym but when they get tired
[44:40] and when they get pushed and when they
[44:42] get into that there's a when the world
[44:45] starts narrowing and the walls start
[44:47] closing in and they can't see
[44:49] peripherally anymore Y and they're
[44:51] exhausted and they start making mistakes
[44:53] so all of their understanding of what to
[44:56] do next gets clapped outed because
[44:57] they're thinking about quitting they're
[44:59] thinking about being exhausted when am I
[45:01] going to get a break how much do I have
[45:04] left in a tank can I even push forward
[45:07] here or will I gas out and risk getting
[45:09] stopped and that is exactly what you
[45:12] said goes on into the human mind yeah
[45:15] when Talent when you have a talent
[45:17] problem yeah it's exactly what goes on
[45:18] your mind so how are you going to
[45:19] [ __ ] defeat that bro you're sitting
[45:22] there getting beat the [ __ ] down by a
[45:24] [ __ ] just on you [ __ ] just
[45:26] going you down take down take down take
[45:29] down hit in the face hit in the face and
[45:30] all it's going through your mind is what
[45:32] you just [ __ ] said there's no
[45:35] positivity in that but when you train
[45:37] the mind the way I train mine [ __ ]
[45:40] ready man [ __ ] ready because first of
[45:42] all I didn't have much talent so I had
[45:44] to train one [ __ ] thing you better
[45:47] train your [ __ ] mind because my
[45:48] talents going to run out way early when
[45:50] [ __ ] got hard for me back in the day bro
[45:52] I'm done I'm out see you okay I got to
[45:56] invent a [ __ ] that can so I
[45:58] invented goggin I invented a
[46:00] [ __ ] that that that realized
[46:02] we're not good enough but gogins
[46:05] realizes we're mentally strong as [ __ ]
[46:08] and we're going to outstrength these
[46:09] [ __ ] in the mind there's a big
[46:13] um there's an understanding in fighting
[46:16] that sometimes
[46:18] Talent is a curse because some people
[46:21] are very talented and they just don't
[46:23] work as hard you know uh khabib Nur off
[46:27] talks about that and he's one of the
[46:29] greatest mixed martial arts fighters of
[46:31] all time one of the rare guys to retire
[46:34] undefeated but he's like talented guys
[46:36] don't work hard enough no he's like
[46:38] talented guys the problem with talented
[46:41] guys is they can get by early they're
[46:44] they're like faster than people maybe
[46:46] they just have a better understanding or
[46:47] better coordination some people just you
[46:50] know we're not even like people are not
[46:53] even in their abilities when it comes to
[46:55] sports some people are just very gifted
[46:57] yes but gifted fighters in particular
[47:01] they just there's something about it
[47:02] where a lot of them never realize their
[47:06] full potential no because they don't
[47:08] develop that mental game that you're
[47:09] talking about they don't have to because
[47:11] they could piece people up on the
[47:13] outside they win fights easy they stop a
[47:15] bunch of people in the first round they
[47:17] look like a hero but then when someone
[47:19] comes along that can survive that first
[47:22] round and then start dragging him into
[47:24] hell that's right oh and you see and
[47:26] that's you said you drag a [ __ ]
[47:28] into hell who's a [ __ ] who's a demon
[47:30] yeah you're in the long for a long race
[47:32] and and they're hard people with a
[47:34] talent problem who are so talented
[47:37] they're hard to train they're hard to
[47:39] push if if if you're their coach and you
[47:43] trying to get them to see that we got to
[47:45] get you past this Talent problem we got
[47:47] we got to get you to the point where
[47:48] you're into that mental Zone because we
[47:51] got to get you way past your talent and
[47:53] it's it's hard for coaches to take these
[47:56] these f or whoever past their talent and
[47:59] on the other side is that is where they
[48:01] gain true true levels the the the levels
[48:05] Beyond talent that that's where it
[48:07] really is because if you're able to take
[48:09] a [ __ ] down to Deep
[48:10] End while [ __ ] just putting his
[48:12] toe in feeling the water and [ __ ] if it
[48:15] my first in the deep end he would take
[48:16] you down there and he's mentally strong
[48:18] it's over it's over man they because
[48:21] they because they live in the deep end
[48:23] they live in it man they thrive in it
[48:25] you it's almost like you have to have
[48:28] the ability to go to the deep end no
[48:29] matter whether or not you'll ever go
[48:31] there right yes and some people are like
[48:34] well I'm never going to go to the deep
[48:35] end but you should be able to yes 100%
[48:39] you have to be trained to do it you have
[48:41] to be trained for it for that time comes
[48:43] you're like okay I'm deep in qualified
[48:46] yeah I am deep in [ __ ] qualified I
[48:48] got my [ __ ] deep in certification but
[48:51] you know what's interesting about this
[48:52] book is you talk about how there was
[48:55] moments even though you're clearly deep
[48:57] end qualified clearly deep end certified
[49:00] yes sir you took some time and you
[49:02] hadn't been a deep end for a while and
[49:03] you like I'm kind of a part-time Savage
[49:05] now right this is kind of [ __ ] and
[49:07] you're recognizing it in yourself even
[49:09] though you know your ability you know
[49:12] your history you know what you've been
[49:13] capable of doing in the past you're like
[49:15] but I haven't been there nope I haven't
[49:17] been there in a while and you had to go
[49:18] back what's funny about that part-time
[49:20] Savage thing in there man where I
[49:22] [ __ ] totally dogged myself because
[49:23] the truth um all this became nice
[49:27] waking up
[49:28] [ __ ] bakon in eggs [ __ ]
[49:31] [ __ ] [ __ ] protein shake early morning
[49:34] [ __ ] and I stopped having those hard
[49:37] conversations with
[49:39] myself boy my whole life that's why
[49:41] motherfu hate my ass boy because I'm
[49:43] hard on me if I'm hard on me I don't
[49:46] give a [ __ ] about you I don't give a
[49:48] [ __ ] about what you think I don't give a
[49:49] [ __ ] you think about me nothing else
[49:51] hard on myself bro every morning I woke
[49:53] up all right [ __ ] I call my
[49:55] morning meeting
[49:56] my morning me we all have these [ __ ]
[49:58] meetings all [ __ ] day long you know
[50:00] we go to work we're we're working for
[50:02] somebody else they want a meeting
[50:04] because they want to be successful so we
[50:05] all sit our ass down try to make them
[50:07] better try to make them more money try
[50:08] to make them more powerful we don't do
[50:11] that for ourselves so every morning I
[50:12] wake up I used to I I had to get back
[50:14] into it again because in that chapter
[50:16] you see I became a little [ __ ] that
[50:18] morning meeting I wake up okay goggin
[50:20] what did you do [ __ ] up yesterday
[50:22] where were you at and I go through and
[50:24] analyze my life and then went through a
[50:26] period of time there man where I stopped

[50:59] back in the hard conversation that you
[51:01] should be having with Mary Joel hey Mary
[51:03] Joel you [ __ ] gained some weight huh
[51:04] sister [ __ ] kind of big that's what I
[51:07] do to myself a lot of people that we see
[51:09] all day long we see them you don't have
[51:12] the hard conversation with we we walk
[51:13] around I rather you [ __ ] hate me and
[51:16] get better than like me and stay the
[51:18] same and that's how I feel about David
[51:21] Goggins [ __ ] I rather me hate I
[51:23] hating you David man I hate you David
[51:25] but I get better from it I get better
[51:28] from it and that's why when people see
[51:29] me and I know you you're you're in my
[51:31] little Foxhole if you're in my Foxhole
[51:33] and you become a piece of [ __ ] hey come
[51:36] here brother let me talk to you real
[51:38] quick Brother people don't like that
[51:39] [ __ ] man but I'm not going to allow you
[51:42] to go to a place that's going to be hard
[51:45] to get out of it's G to be hard if I
[51:48] allow you gain five more pounds or allow
[51:50] you take four more days off of school or
[51:52] like to keep on procrastinating in your
[51:55] [ __ ] life and I see and I tell
[51:57] Jennifer behind your back I'm doing you
[51:59] no [ __ ] Justice zero justice so where
[52:03] this world is now you can't say a
[52:05] [ __ ] thing I do I still do and
[52:09] I always will don't like me don't like
[52:12] me I'm good with that that's exactly
[52:15] what's going on with like fat models
[52:18] that's it I'm proud like you're
[52:20] beautiful no matter what but that's not
[52:23] true and the thing about it is I have no
[52:25] problem if you want to be fat I have no
[52:28] problem with anybody if you want to be
[52:30] whatever the [ __ ] you want to be but
[52:33] make sure you [ __ ] if you're fat
[52:34] [ __ ] go go be fat go be real
[52:36] [ __ ] fat but let's be real nobody
[52:38] wants to be fat nobody does that's why I
[52:40] said it man nobody does that's not true
[52:42] they will pretend I'm fine with it but
[52:44] if I could give you a button that you
[52:46] could push and boink be skinny all of a
[52:49] sudden you'd have this incredible body
[52:50] take everybody would push that button
[52:52] but what happens is man we get in this
[52:53] world where it gets hard yeah
[52:57] and so the harder it is the more you
[52:59] start to push
[53:01] back and the more you push back and then
[53:03] it's not right for people to talk about
[53:05] it's not right for like let's say you
[53:07] are fat I was fat that's why I talk
[53:10] about it go ahead and say something
[53:11] [ __ ] I was fat too and it was
[53:14] hard as [ __ ] every [ __ ] day to get up
[53:15] I know what it feels like when you roll
[53:17] your fat ass out of bed and all you want
[53:19] is some [ __ ] damn cinnamon buns and
[53:21] [ __ ] and [ __ ] CH chocolate milkshakes
[53:23] I I know what it is I know exactly what
[53:25] it is but I can't want it more than you
[53:30] and so many people just want it the easy
[53:32] way it I'm sorry man it's not so what
[53:35] they start to do is they build this
[53:38] Narrative of it's okay when the
[53:41] narrative should be you need to [ __ ]
[53:43] work harder you need to [ __ ]
[53:45] discipline your mind better we need to
[53:48] help people more than just saying it's
[53:51] okay it's okay that you're not [ __ ]
[53:54] willing to [ __ ] help yourself out
[53:56] that's not not okay it's not okay it's
[53:58] not acceptable even though it's your
[54:00] life if that's if if that's acceptable
[54:03] that's unacceptable and there's a lot of
[54:05] people in this world me included that if
[54:07] I accepted that I wouldn't be anywhere
[54:10] so yeah a lot of people just [ __ ]
[54:12] they they start creating a narrative
[54:14] about themselves that make it okay the
[54:17] ultimate get out jail free card and now
[54:19] the world is set up to have so many gel
[54:22] free cards everything is okay and you
[54:25] can't say a [ __ ] thing about it
[54:28] this is what it's interesting though is
[54:30] that when you're talking about how you
[54:32] had to come to this realization that
[54:33] You' become a part-time Savage this is
[54:37] recently yeah that's uh you're looking
[54:39] at
[54:41] 200
[54:43] no 2018 yeah yeah 2018 not that long ago
[54:47] no [ __ ] no yeah so even though you've
[54:49] been through all those things and you
[54:52] have all this information in your head
[54:54] it's like there's no rest no you never
[54:56] get a chance and if you do take a little
[54:58] time and start enjoying it all of a
[55:01] sudden that General in the back of your
[55:03] head is like hey hey look what you're
[55:05] doing exactly you're being a little
[55:06] [ __ ] and so in your mind you had gotten
[55:10] soft oh 100% And my softness was still
[55:14] two days so if you look in there two a
[55:16] days was you being soft my part-time
[55:19] Savage was me running like 50 miles a
[55:22] week me [ __ ] not you know because
[55:24] what what I used to do and what I do now
[55:26] is I got to a point I be running I was
[55:28] like okay man we could do 10 miles today
[55:32] I get I get to 10 miles like oh no
[55:34] [ __ ] that [ __ ] demon that I
[55:36] let out every [ __ ] morning that walks
[55:38] the streets at night he comes say no
[55:40] [ __ ] not today man there's somebody out
[55:43] there that you don't know have never
[55:45] [ __ ] met in your entire life that is
[55:47] doing 12 13 14 going to do another one
[55:51] and when you meet
[55:52] him you ain't gonna be [ __ ] ready so
[55:56] goggin kept on running so you talk about
[55:58] that and uh you talk about how cam came
[56:01] to visit you in Vegas and gave you a
[56:02] spot check oh yeah oh yeah I'm always
[56:04] ready for a [ __ ] like cam I'm
[56:06] always ready for a mother like cam so
[56:08] out of nowhere dude this guy calls me
[56:10] literally and this is one thing about
[56:12] life this is why you always must be
[56:15] ready always be ready never get ready
[56:19] people go oh hey what do you training
[56:20] for David I ain't training for [ __ ] when
[56:23] something pops up I'll be [ __ ] ready
[56:25] so when Cam Pop the [ __ ] up and cam
[56:27] calls hey man I'm going to be in uh Las
[56:30] Vegas you want to go for a
[56:32] run sure do sure do brother sure do
[56:37] while the Run sucked I was ready well
[56:40] you guys were doing like six minute
[56:42] miles for like 26 miles it was Brut it
[56:44] was 20 miles and Jennifer was with us
[56:47] and so Jennifer can run her [ __ ] ass
[56:49] off she's fast as [ __ ] so we went out
[56:52] but she's not a six-minute mile Runner
[56:55] so we went out for the first first 10
[56:56] and Jennifer is with us she was with us
[56:58] for the first seven she turned around I
[57:00] think she did like 15 miles so me and
[57:02] Cam went out after we left Jennifer she
[57:04] went back for another three to go out
[57:06] and get 10 and come back 10 but my whole
[57:08] idea was I know the course [ __ ] I'm
[57:12] about to drop your [ __ ] ass
[57:14] [ __ ] so we go out cause because
[57:16] going out is a little bit um as old I
[57:22] think it was a little bit uphill no a
[57:24] little bit downhill a little bit
[57:25] downhill so a little bit downhill so we
[57:27] turn around 10 Mile Mark come back and I
[57:29] could tell Cam was hurting boy but Cam's
[57:31] a prideful [ __ ] dude prideful
[57:34] [ __ ] love that dude so we get to
[57:36] about mile 16 17 and I could tell now he
[57:41] kind of comes off my shoulder slightly
[57:44] and I'm like oh [ __ ] in the armor I
[57:47] feel it you know you eyes kind looking
[57:49] at you know out you know out of your
[57:50] prip vision but I'm like this is a
[57:53] prideful [ __ ] man and keep on
[57:56] going man holding sixes we gets about
[57:59] mile 18 I look Cam's right back on the
[58:01] shoulder I just smiled I said you are
[58:04] exactly who the [ __ ] I thought you were
[58:06] a [ __ ] and so we went out tested
[58:09] each other man good day went to the gym
[58:11] worked out hard went and got some steak
[58:13] same day same oh we [ __ ] worked it
[58:15] out dude whenever meet him together you
[58:17] can guarantee it's G to be two people
[58:21] that love each other but are waiting for
[58:23] the other [ __ ] to break
[58:26] 100% dude it's like this thing in the
[58:29] back of her head okay maybe this will
[58:30] break them maybe this will break him so
[58:32] we haven't broken each other yet but I'm
[58:34] sure the day will come so so you run 20
[58:37] miles and then you lift weights but see
[58:40] lifting weights people like people don't
[58:41] get it man it's not like lifting weights
[58:43] it's like you know we go and do like so
[58:46] many reps like people go oh you're only
[58:49] doing um was like 90 some pounds on the
[58:52] incline [ __ ] do five sets of 2
[58:56] five with a super set of push-ups super
[58:59] set of curls super set of pull-ups super
[59:01] set of triceps super set of what the
[59:03] [ __ ] else was I forget it's a super set
[59:06] man so we're going through lifting
[59:07] lightweight but for massive massive
[59:10] amounts of reps and so you're like
[59:12] totally swollen and like it's just the
[59:15] some some of the best workouts in the
[59:16] world between me and him some of the
[59:18] best workouts in the world man and then
[59:20] you had steak and then we had steak
[59:22] that's right then and then I treat can
[59:23] to a steak right and that's a mental aid
[59:26] station mental oh yes mental Aid
[59:29] stations baby I think one of the most
[59:31] important parts about the way you
[59:33] express yourself in your books is that
[59:35] you do talk about your weaknesses and
[59:37] you you do talk about your past and how
[59:39] you started off on this journey and you
[59:41] talk about how there are those moments
[59:44] that you doubt oh yeah and you but you
[59:46] still go oh yeah sometimes like you know
[59:48] I call it uh you got call an audible you
[59:52] know the line of scrimmage man like some
[59:53] of the great
[59:54] quarterbacks they'll be at the line of
[59:56] scrimmage and they'll look at the
[59:57] defense the defense is oh [ __ ] defense
[01:00:00] is Shifting then he calling audible in
[01:00:03] my mind a lot of times man I'm like it
[01:00:05] doesn't mean I quit I don't quit you
[01:00:08] know I may not make it the first time
[01:00:11] but I'll come back I gota call an
[01:00:13] audible I gotta [ __ ] I gotta I gotta
[01:00:15] [ __ ] get my head back in the game I
[01:00:17] gotta I gotta figure this [ __ ] out it
[01:00:20] doesn't mean you leave it means you
[01:00:21] study it more it means you study it more
[01:00:23] and and whenever I feel at something
[01:00:26] people I say man how do you handle
[01:00:27] failure man I fail a lot dude I fail all
[01:00:30] the [ __ ] time they go how do you
[01:00:32] handle it what I'm trying to do and this
[01:00:36] isn't being arrogant man I I it's being
[01:00:38] real not many people are trying to do so
[01:00:42] there's not many people that who who can
[01:00:43] even open their [ __ ] mouth and
[01:00:46] criticize me when I do fail because I'm
[01:00:49] on I'm I'm I'm trying to do [ __ ] man
[01:00:50] that many people aren't trying to do but
[01:00:52] I don't look at failure as failure I
[01:00:54] look at failure as your first second
[01:00:56] third fourth fifth attempt I look at
[01:00:59] them as attempts I don't look at
[01:01:01] anything as failure because when you're
[01:01:03] willing to try to do some not trying is
[01:01:06] failure that's that's and that's not
[01:01:08] some after school special [ __ ] but when
[01:01:10] you're able to go out there there there
[01:01:12] is no failure it's attempts because when
[01:01:14] you're trying to do something that's
[01:01:16] bigger than you whatever you are whoever
[01:01:18] you are if if if you're paralyzed you
[01:01:20] trying to walk one step and you didn't
[01:01:22] you didn't fail [ __ ] that was
[01:01:23] your first attempt if that's your
[01:01:26] biggest thing that's how your mindset
[01:01:28] needs to go into everything so I don't
[01:01:30] look at it as failure is a big word like
[01:01:32] that gets people down and [ __ ] we give
[01:01:34] so much power to words I don't I take
[01:01:37] the power right away I didn't feel [ __ ]
[01:01:39] do you ever have conversations with Cam
[01:01:41] about
[01:01:43] mindset we no we we we really don't go
[01:01:46] there too much at all about mindset like
[01:01:48] whenever we get together it's really
[01:01:50] about breaking the [ __ ] down
[01:01:52] like it's like it's like but wouldn't
[01:01:54] you be interested though in how he
[01:01:56] approach because I don't know if
[01:01:58] everybody shares your approach I know
[01:02:00] there's not very many people like you
[01:02:02] right cam is one of them right so like
[01:02:04] how many of them are like you and how
[01:02:06] many of them have that sort of similar
[01:02:08] approach and how many of them are
[01:02:10] willing to discuss their own demons
[01:02:13] because a lot of people that are like
[01:02:15] super endurance athletes or very hard
[01:02:17] people they don't ever want to even
[01:02:19] discuss the weakness they don't want to
[01:02:21] shine any light on it no people hate
[01:02:22] that yeah people hate it man and I love
[01:02:24] it and the re hate it to me this is just
[01:02:27] my own theory is because you haven't
[01:02:30] beat
[01:02:30] it that's why people go man why are you
[01:02:33] so open and vulnerable I'll tell you
[01:02:35] everything I lied about everything I
[01:02:37] [ __ ] up with every I'll tell you
[01:02:39] everything I am an open [ __ ] book I
[01:02:41] don't give a [ __ ] the only reason why I
[01:02:43] don't give a [ __ ] anymore is because I
[01:02:47] overcame it and I beat it so I'm will to
[01:02:49] talk about it why most people aren't
[01:02:51] willing to go to that darkness and that
[01:02:53] vulnerability is because they're still
[01:02:55] dealing with it
[01:02:57] when people who have overcome it they're
[01:02:59] open [ __ ] book bro because they're
[01:03:02] proud they're [ __ ] proud that's why I
[01:03:04] speak man man why are you always yelling
[01:03:05] guys [ __ ] you this how I talk [ __ ] cuz
[01:03:08] I'm proud motherfu you know what I'm
[01:03:09] saying I'm a proud [ __ ] man it's
[01:03:11] not proud like look at me it's like
[01:03:13] [ __ ] I know where I [ __ ] came
[01:03:15] from [ __ ] I shouldn't be here right now
[01:03:18] talking to you shouldn't be talking to
[01:03:20] you [ __ ] I shouldn't be here I
[01:03:21] us a fat sloppy [ __ ] I'm proud
[01:03:24] so I'm able to tell you I was [ __ ] up
[01:03:27] many people can't you know that's a
[01:03:30] common thing that people say when I
[01:03:33] interview them after fights like I'm not
[01:03:35] supposed to be here this is not supposed
[01:03:36] to happen to me I not there's a common
[01:03:39] thing when I've had conversations with
[01:03:41] people and they you know they've won a
[01:03:43] big fight they've had this big event
[01:03:46] right they they say I wasn't supposed to
[01:03:47] be here right statistically like Chris
[01:03:51] Gutierrez just said that uh last UFC
[01:03:53] fight when I interviewed him he like I'm
[01:03:55] not supposed to be here right probably
[01:03:57] because they come from a bad place
[01:03:59] exactly you know they and when you're in
[01:04:00] a bad especially when you're young you
[01:04:02] know redevelop
[01:04:04] self-esteem you know by the age of seven
[01:04:08] if you're if if if you're not good by
[01:04:10] the age of seven or eight years old you
[01:04:13] have a good chance of being [ __ ] the
[01:04:14] rest of your life yeah so if your
[01:04:16] parents or or you came up wrong and then
[01:04:19] seven or eight if you don't have the
[01:04:21] self-esteem but you [ __ ] grind you're
[01:04:22] like I want to be better when you get to
[01:04:25] that
[01:04:26] UFC Championship or you get to where
[01:04:28] where I got or where I
[01:04:31] am it's almost like you can't believe
[01:04:33] the journey like I talked about in that
[01:04:34] [ __ ] VFW and I'm in the first chapter
[01:04:36] of that book man I'm sitting in that
[01:04:38] audience all those [ __ ] people and
[01:04:40] I'm about to get the you know
[01:04:42] americanism award and I was grinding so
[01:04:44] hard I never took time to reflect in my
[01:04:46] life and this was like time to reflect
[01:04:50] and I was all kind of [ __ ] up I got on
[01:04:52] stage man just [ __ ] cried for like 59
[01:04:54] seconds
[01:04:56] and it was such an emotional moment for
[01:04:58] me that I [ __ ] that I [ __ ] did
[01:05:00] what I did and I I overcame and it was
[01:05:03] it was alone man you know a lot of
[01:05:05] people have [ __ ] like teammates and
[01:05:07] [ __ ] like you know family push my my
[01:05:10] mom was struggling bro she was strug so
[01:05:12] it was like me and my mom and so it's a
[01:05:15] lot of just me so when you're waking up
[01:05:17] every morning by yourself and you're
[01:05:19] [ __ ] getting after by yourself and
[01:05:21] and it's the it's the hidden work people
[01:05:25] see one minute you know video of me
[01:05:26] running and [ __ ] like and like these
[01:05:28] Fighters you know they they see during
[01:05:31] the fight or after the fight they don't
[01:05:33] see these [ __ ] man what they
[01:05:34] deal with every [ __ ] day I'm not good
[01:05:37] enough I'm not good enough I shouldn't
[01:05:39] be here I shouldn't be here because
[01:05:40] every day even though they're [ __ ]
[01:05:42] the best in the world that little
[01:05:44] [ __ ] at seven or eight years old
[01:05:45] is still in there saying oh man we we
[01:05:47] don't have so we're not good enough
[01:05:49] we're not we shouldn't be here so you're
[01:05:51] always fighting that [ __ ] even
[01:05:53] though you beat it you never truly beat
[01:05:55] it so when they get on stage and talking
[01:05:57] to Joe Rogan it's it's a it's not even
[01:06:00] real it's not even real all those
[01:06:02] mornings that you didn't want to [ __ ]
[01:06:03] get up and and I look at it as like a
[01:06:07] [ __ ] like a rock and you find this
[01:06:10] [ __ ] rock and that rock is you and
[01:06:12] every day you [ __ ] fight not wanting
[01:06:14] to get up and you do anyway you chip
[01:06:17] another piece off that [ __ ] rock and
[01:06:18] every day you [ __ ] eat the right
[01:06:20] foods and every day you go to train you
[01:06:21] train harder and harder and harder and
[01:06:23] harder and you get up earlier and all
[01:06:25] these things you do to start forming
[01:06:26] yourself you're chipping another [ __ ]
[01:06:29] piece of that rock up before you know it
[01:06:31] you have this beautiful [ __ ] piece of
[01:06:33] of of of artwork that that you built but
[01:06:37] people don't and then once you get there
[01:06:38] you see it and it becomes real like oh
[01:06:40] my God I [ __ ] did this [ __ ] and so
[01:06:43] like the [ __ ] Journey becomes so real
[01:06:45] then but so many people aren't willing
[01:06:47] to [ __ ] chip away at that stone that
[01:06:50] is them to start chipping off those
[01:06:52] [ __ ] rough edges that's the fear the
[01:06:54] fear is never reach ing your potential
[01:06:56] that's it that always falling short
[01:06:58] always quitting before you're done
[01:07:00] always procrastinating always not doing
[01:07:04] the right thing and then one day you're
[01:07:06] an old man yep and you look back and go
[01:07:08] God I could have been great yep I could
[01:07:10] have been great I never forget one time
[01:07:13] I was running by a graveyard and I was
[01:07:15] [ __ ] just trying to become I was fat
[01:07:18] and I ran by a graveyard and I looked
[01:07:20] out there and I have all these
[01:07:23] epiphanies man I have all these [ __ ]
[01:07:24] moments of like
[01:07:26] of it's crazy man of of this thought I'm
[01:07:28] always by myself I'm always in deep
[01:07:30] [ __ ] thought about how to be better I
[01:07:32] look out there I'm like man I wonder how
[01:07:34] many of you [ __ ] in there
[01:07:36] [ __ ] just are so upset with how you
[01:07:39] lived your life and [ __ ] just regret
[01:07:42] how you lived it and I'm running at 300
[01:07:44] pound man thinking
[01:07:46] man don't [ __ ] die like this bro
[01:07:49] don't die like this so people wonder
[01:07:51] where this [ __ ] comes from from
[01:07:53] me it comes from such deep thought of
[01:07:57] trying to see what this is all about
[01:07:59] what is this life all about what am I
[01:08:01] all about why am I here you know I had
[01:08:05] to I had to find purpose
[01:08:08] and my suffering it had a purpose it had
[01:08:12] a [ __ ]
[01:08:13] purpose do you talk to other people that
[01:08:16] are like you and try to understand if
[01:08:18] they're going through the same thing are
[01:08:19] they're trying to gather knowledge as
[01:08:21] well are they just doing it because
[01:08:23] they're addicted to Runner's High are
[01:08:25] they doing it because they enjoy the
[01:08:27] challenge like how many people do you
[01:08:29] talk to that are like you I've never
[01:08:32] talked to anyone that and most people
[01:08:35] don't even believe what I say half the
[01:08:36] time that I I I do it to [ __ ] gain
[01:08:39] knowledge and all that [ __ ] I haven't
[01:08:42] met one that goes out there people
[01:08:44] really enjoy a lot of the [ __ ] that they
[01:08:46] do like like they I don't know many
[01:08:49] people can go out and run 240 miles at
[01:08:51] one time if you don't enjoy
[01:08:53] it if if you just don't don't really
[01:08:56] enjoy it so you know I I
[01:09:01] had many people build confidence
[01:09:03] different ways and they build belief in
[01:09:06] different ways coming from where I came
[01:09:08] from I didn't have any belief in myself
[01:09:12] so some people can go read a book and
[01:09:14] get belief some people can go take a
[01:09:16] yoga class have good parents I had to
[01:09:19] put myself some where I came from was so
[01:09:23] far down underneath like soil that I had
[01:09:28] to build belief by truly ingraining it
[01:09:32] in my brain so the things I do I'm
[01:09:35] always every day building belief and my
[01:09:39] belief had to be where it is because I
[01:09:40] was so far down so it may take a 200
[01:09:43] mile run for me it may take a 100 mile
[01:09:44] run it may take late nights in the gym
[01:09:48] but without belief you have nothing and
[01:09:51] I realized that when I was a young kid I
[01:09:53] have no belief I have to build it and a
[01:09:56] fivemile run didn't do it I had to push
[01:09:58] myself to such extremes because I came
[01:10:00] from people judge me by not knowing
[01:10:02] where I came
[01:10:04] from so unless you're me and you came
[01:10:08] from where I came from I guarantee you
[01:10:09] would have made it out guarantee it and
[01:10:12] I knew that so my belief comes from
[01:10:13] going I had to build it and that's how I
[01:10:16] build it man I build it by the things I
[01:10:18] do it's so painful reading about your
[01:10:21] childhood and the experiences with your
[01:10:24] father and then when you went
[01:10:28] back and met your father as an adult and
[01:10:32] got with them and watched him get drunk
[01:10:34] and then watch him get belligerent and
[01:10:36] and experience it all over
[01:10:39] again and then think about what happened
[01:10:41] to him to make him who he is yeah that
[01:10:44] [ __ ] me up dude but I had to go
[01:10:46] like I realized I was [ __ ] I was I was
[01:10:50] just a sorry [ __ ] you know I
[01:10:52] quit peir rescue I spray the water every
[01:10:54] time [ __ ] got hard like I said I didn't
[01:10:57] have talent you know I I [ __ ] didn't
[01:10:59] have [ __ ] and whenever [ __ ] got hard for
[01:11:01] me I thought I was on my way out and and
[01:11:02] I got suck back in I become I become a
[01:11:05] loser again real quick and I see him all
[01:11:06] the time there's a lot of [ __ ] losers
[01:11:08] out here that won't face it I like oh
[01:11:11] man gota go back and visit this
[01:11:13] [ __ ] I I haven't seen my dad in
[01:11:15] [ __ ] years man years but I knew where
[01:11:19] I came from I knew where my mindset came
[01:11:22] from I knew where my demons were so my
[01:11:25] whole idea when I went back to see my
[01:11:27] dad was I was hoping that I could just
[01:11:29] [ __ ] call myself a losion it's
[01:11:31] because of you Dad so I was hoping to go
[01:11:34] back and get the confirmation that I
[01:11:37] always wanted that wasn't my fault that
[01:11:39] voice in my head was so loud it's not
[01:11:41] your fault David it's not your fault you
[01:11:43] can't read and write it's not your fault
[01:11:45] that people call you [ __ ] [ __ ] it's
[01:11:46] not your fault it's not your fault this
[01:11:48] not your fault that it's not your fault
[01:11:49] that you're fat it's not your fault that
[01:11:51] you're that that you quit [ __ ] it's not
[01:11:53] your fault so so I was like okay man I'm
[01:11:55] going go back visit this [ __ ] so
[01:11:57] I can just squash it and I can just go
[01:11:58] on and be a [ __ ] loser cuz you [ __ ]
[01:12:01] me up and when I got there went drove to
[01:12:04] Buffalo saw my dad same routine as it
[01:12:07] was when I was 8 years old man walked in
[01:12:10] what's up went to Skate Land I sat on
[01:12:13] that [ __ ] couch that he would cheat
[01:12:15] on my mom with I sat on that couch in
[01:12:17] the corner and I was like God what the
[01:12:19] [ __ ] man and it was a whole normal day
[01:12:22] and the more I was around him he started
[01:12:24] now he started getting drunk and and I
[01:12:26] won't go through the whole thing but I
[01:12:28] started seeing man I started having a
[01:12:30] convers I always have these
[01:12:31] conversations with myself like man this
[01:12:34] [ __ ] he came from
[01:12:36] Hell his dad would put him in front of a
[01:12:39] furnace and like if he moved he get
[01:12:42] burnt so when when when my dad got
[01:12:45] beat um his dad would put him from the
[01:12:48] furnace and if he would have move he'd
[01:12:50] [ __ ] get burnt up so my dad's had to
[01:12:52] sit there and take it so he never dealt
[01:12:54] with [ __ ] demons so his demons became
[01:12:58] mine his demons became mine
[01:13:01] [ __ ] think you die and and and
[01:13:03] the demon goes with you man don't be a
[01:13:06] [ __ ] fool bro you know like that's
[01:13:09] why I'm proud of myself I took his
[01:13:11] demons and mine and people are always
[01:13:13] looking for some great [ __ ] apology
[01:13:16] you know oh my God like um you know my
[01:13:19] my dad need to say sorry people who
[01:13:21] [ __ ] called you out your name or
[01:13:23] nobody couldn't come back and say sorry
[01:13:24] to you you [ __ ] ain't nobody
[01:13:26] saying [ __ ] to you you better a [ __ ]
[01:13:28] man the [ __ ] up so I looked at him he
[01:13:31] didn't face his demons I'm going to face
[01:13:33] mine so on that drive back home that's
[01:13:35] what I started doing you know what's one
[01:13:37] of the most most [ __ ] up things that
[01:13:38] I've learned over time is that almost
[01:13:41] all like truly exceptional and mentally
[01:13:45] strong people have been through hell
[01:13:47] it's it's very few that put themselves
[01:13:50] through hell when life is great it's
[01:13:52] just not usually the case right and to
[01:13:55] to achieve the the the standards that
[01:13:58] you've achieved to achieve the to become
[01:13:59] the person that you are today and to
[01:14:01] have the influence that you have this
[01:14:03] Global influence on people do you how
[01:14:05] many people have laced up their shoes
[01:14:07] because they heard your voice how many
[01:14:09] people have just moved into action and
[01:14:12] changed their life because they've heard
[01:14:14] you talk or seen you talk it's it's
[01:14:17] there's a thing that happened and it
[01:14:20] happened out of hell and I don't think
[01:14:23] it ever happens without that it's like
[01:14:26] you had to go through that in order to
[01:14:29] empower all these other people in order
[01:14:31] to become who you are and that as an
[01:14:34] example and then your words as an
[01:14:37] example and your describing of it and
[01:14:39] then your description of your own
[01:14:41] shortcomings and failures that give
[01:14:43] people confidence that you it's not like
[01:14:45] you're this superhuman person that is
[01:14:48] like a character in a book right now
[01:14:50] you're a real human being who has real
[01:14:53] insecurities and real failur in your
[01:14:55] past and and and real demons and you
[01:14:58] figured out a way to harness that energy
[01:15:01] and just keep going forward yep and not
[01:15:05] quit that's it that's it I mean there
[01:15:07] there are no timeouts you know people
[01:15:11] like I you know there's a part in the
[01:15:13] book that I talk about a prisoner mind
[01:15:16] and that's about my
[01:15:17] mother and you know she just um that's I
[01:15:22] would never listen to that part again in
[01:15:24] that book that was hard just so you know
[01:15:26] man like I will never again listen to
[01:15:28] that [ __ ] your mother's very very very
[01:15:30] brave oh to be able to talk like that
[01:15:34] yeah to be able
[01:15:37] to to be able to talk like that um to
[01:15:40] the world and
[01:15:43] to to
[01:15:45] just she lost her life she lost this
[01:15:48] giant chunk of her life with this
[01:15:50] abusive
[01:15:51] man and to hear her talking about him
[01:15:55] hitting her and what it was like and the
[01:15:57] fact that she never came from a family
[01:16:00] that hit her she had never been hit
[01:16:02] before never and to to to have her
[01:16:05] express it the way she did so honestly
[01:16:08] and
[01:16:09] openly very powerful and the whole time
[01:16:11] she's talking man she's on the cusp of
[01:16:13] like losing it like I'm in the other
[01:16:16] room so I'm I'm interviewing her and I'm
[01:16:19] hearing this [ __ ] so I I knew a lot
[01:16:21] about it obviously I lived it and that's
[01:16:24] what [ __ ] me up the most man when you
[01:16:26] see like I said I wasn't a smart kid
[01:16:28] growing up but who whatever made me
[01:16:33] whatever the [ __ ] made me I'm so [ __ ]
[01:16:37] my mind is sharp man like
[01:16:39] it's it's crazy like I could I was so
[01:16:44] aware of so much [ __ ] I was so bright in
[01:16:46] that way and to see your mom go through
[01:16:49] that [ __ ] as that young kid and like I
[01:16:51] was going through it and she was going
[01:16:53] through right beside me like when I got
[01:16:55] my ass beat she got her ass beat it was
[01:16:58] it's [ __ ] up man like you you you just
[01:17:00] can't you know people you know people

[01:17:08] just turn who the [ __ ] you are off when
[01:17:10] you see your mom going that kind of [ __ ]
[01:17:13] and then I'm coming to her defense at
[01:17:16] seven or eight years old and she's
[01:17:17] getting her [ __ ] ass beat by a 220 lb
[01:17:20] man and I'm [ __ ] some little kid know
[01:17:23] what kind of Courage it takes to Muster
[01:17:25] that up to go help her out and to see
[01:17:26] her [ __ ] up like that and the time she
[01:17:29] would cry and be bruised up and [ __ ] it
[01:17:31] was just it was a it was a [ __ ]
[01:17:33] nightmare and then hear her talk about
[01:17:34] it like the part where my dad says I
[01:17:38] brought this belt from Texas this belt
[01:17:40] came all the way from Texas whip your
[01:17:41] ass with I it it was like what the like
[01:17:44] where am I at right now cuz I knew no
[01:17:47] other households right were [ __ ]
[01:17:49] living like this man I and and I knew it
[01:17:53] I knew it and then she was shut off she
[01:17:56] was shut off from the world and when I
[01:17:58] wrote can't hurt me she
[01:18:00] refused she said [ __ ] don't put my [ __ ]
[01:18:03] in there she was so embarrassed you know
[01:18:06] like like I put in there man she [ __ ]
[01:18:08] married a [ __ ]
[01:18:09] prisoner so my mom was so [ __ ] up she
[01:18:13] was so [ __ ] up by this [ __ ] and people
[01:18:16] go people go man you're a mama's boy
[01:18:18] [ __ ] I know mama's boy
[01:18:20] man see your mom go through this [ __ ]
[01:18:23] you're gonna make sure she's taken care
[01:18:24] of
[01:18:25] so she came out and one of the people
[01:18:29] that you know she she got married a few
[01:18:31] times CU she was looking for something
[01:18:32] that my dad stripped from her and she
[01:18:35] was out she was gone for years she just
[01:18:38] now coming back she's 70s she's 75 and
[01:18:41] but in that book I talk about man she's
[01:18:42] like don't don't put that you know and
[01:18:44] can't hurt me but now she's getting
[01:18:45] better and she's allowing me more to
[01:18:47] talk more about my life which was also
[01:18:50] some of her life the part about marrying
[01:18:52] a prisoner is so crazy dude it was a
[01:18:55] [ __ ] but not just a prisoner but a
[01:18:57] prisoner who killed a woman dude
[01:19:01] this so it was so [ __ ] up it's hard
[01:19:04] for me to talk about because it's almost
[01:19:06] like it I was I had a front row seat at
[01:19:08] a horror show
[01:19:10] so when my mom left my dad she went to
[01:19:13] wilmouth and he got murdered I talk
[01:19:15] about that can't hurt me he got murdered
[01:19:17] so that took her all the way over the
[01:19:19] edge I mean he got shot [ __ ] six
[01:19:21] times and the last shot this
[01:19:23] [ __ ] got right up up on his head
[01:19:25] and made sure he was dead like forehead
[01:19:28] shot and so she didn't
[01:19:31] cry she didn't cry she's loost it was
[01:19:34] over she a whole another person became
[01:19:37] and so I'm [ __ ] now like 12 13 14
[01:19:40] what the [ __ ] I was I'm watching this
[01:19:41] woman every day front row seat just
[01:19:43] watching her just go through life [ __ ]
[01:19:45] up and then I'm about to go in the
[01:19:47] military into the Air
[01:19:49] Force and like two years out man you
[01:19:52] know I'm like a sophomore in high school

[01:20:03] 15minute call hang up what the [ __ ] is
[01:20:05] going on but see the way I was grow like
[01:20:07] the way I was raised you don't ask your
[01:20:09] Mom what's going on it a like now like
[01:20:12] conversations and [ __ ] with the parents
[01:20:14] you shut the [ __ ] up and that's I didn't
[01:20:17] ask [ __ ] but I knew something was [ __ ]
[01:20:18] cuz like 3 four hours a night 15 minute
[01:20:21] hang up cuz he was in prison this guy
[01:20:23] was in prison so he only had 15 minutes
[01:20:24] on the phone they had to put more money
[01:20:25] in it how did she meet him she started
[01:20:28] working so she was always about helping
[01:20:31] people out but the thing about it
[01:20:34] was like I was right in front of her and
[01:20:38] needed so much [ __ ]
[01:20:40] help and that it was [ __ ] up for me
[01:20:42] for a long time but she helped out so
[01:20:44] many people but I guess since I was with
[01:20:46] her through the Journey I just I didn't
[01:20:49] count but it's all good man it's what
[01:20:52] life's about you got to understand what
[01:20:53] your mom went through so that I can be
[01:20:55] good with it you know like I saw that so
[01:20:58] I I had to man up a lot more than what

[01:22:19] she lays this on me yeah
[01:22:23] um sit down let me have let's have a
[01:22:25] talk and she never does this [ __ ] man
[01:22:27] she's like there was nothing ever hidden
[01:22:29] from me that's why I grew up so fast
[01:22:31] like that abusive life and what she was
[01:22:34] going through it was front and center
[01:22:36] her her being broke everything this was
[01:22:37] the only secret she kept from me she go
[01:22:40] um those phone calls you know I've been
[01:22:43] uh seeing someone in
[01:22:46] prison all right cool whatever but I'm
[01:22:49] thinking what the [ __ ] is this man so
[01:22:51] you know I hated I didn't want to ask
[01:22:54] how the [ __ ] did you get to
[01:22:56] prison so I'm sitting there I'm sitting
[01:22:58] there I'm sitting there and I'm like
[01:22:59] okay man I got to [ __ ] ask this
[01:23:01] [ __ ]
[01:23:02] question how the [ __ ] you know what what
[01:23:04] happened you know she's like
[01:23:07] well does one of those things you know
[01:23:09] cuz she knows it's [ __ ] bad well he
[01:23:12] was in the drugs and stuff like that I'm
[01:23:14] thinking okay maybe drug dealer
[01:23:15] something like that he was in the drugs
[01:23:18] that's for sure but he literally I don't
[01:23:21] know how it went down but he choked a
[01:23:25] woman to
[01:23:27] death over some
[01:23:29] drugs and I don't know the ins and outs
[01:23:31] or all this other [ __ ] and
[01:23:34] um that's who she was going to [ __ ]
[01:23:37] be with and he was getting out of prison
[01:23:40] literally in a few weeks after I was
[01:23:43] going to Air Force boot camp Jes so I'm
[01:23:45] in [ __ ] Air Force boot camp thinking
[01:23:47] about my mom's about to [ __ ] marry a
[01:23:50] [ __ ] dude who got sent to prison
[01:23:52] marry him right away too right away
[01:23:55] so the first time I meet this
[01:23:57] [ __ ] dude is at my [ __ ] Air
[01:23:59] Force graduation oh Jes my [ __ ] Air
[01:24:02] Force graduation and she was like you
[01:24:04] ain't putting that [ __ ] in can't hurt me
[01:24:07] she was embarrassed about it and then
[01:24:09] she saw how I went totally like [ __ ]
[01:24:11] vulnerable and she was like [ __ ] it go
[01:24:15] ahead so there's there's so much more to
[01:24:17] it but he ended up um uh I think it was
[01:24:21] last year or maybe this year he ow
[01:24:25] so my mom divorced him obviously after
[01:24:27] it it it it didn't work out and she was
[01:24:29] telling me a story one time we were
[01:24:30] talking about this book she started
[01:24:32] opening more up about the
[01:24:34] relationship with this uh with this
[01:24:36] prisoner and she said one night they got
[01:24:39] into a fight you know not not physical
[01:24:41] you know he never hit her like like my
[01:24:44] dad did so many times but he said one
[01:24:46] night she was sleeping and had had her
[01:24:49] back to him and all she thought about
[01:24:52] all [ __ ] night was because she
[01:24:53] started
[01:24:55] slowly realizing like I'm [ __ ] up like
[01:24:58] I just married a [ __ ] guy from prison
[01:25:00] that killed somebody and she started
[01:25:02] realizing it more and more but she's
[01:25:03] laying in bed and she and she was like
[01:25:06] is this [ __ ] gonna [ __ ] kill
[01:25:09] me
[01:25:10] tonight and she started telling me these
[01:25:12] [ __ ] stories man and I'm
[01:25:15] like and I'm just like what the [ __ ] man
[01:25:18] like like you know it's it's it was
[01:25:22] tough it was it was it was a tough way
[01:25:23] to grow up man it was tough tough way to
[01:25:24] grow up so yeah he ended up um so they
[01:25:27] got divorced uh I think it work maybe
[01:25:29] two years where the [ __ ] it was whatever
[01:25:31] it doesn't matter and then um I think he
[01:25:35] ODed last year he OD last year killed
[01:25:38] himself I don't he killed himself he's
[01:25:41] OD
[01:25:43] so the the idea of you going off to boot
[01:25:46] camp knowing that your mom's going to be
[01:25:49] alone with this guy getting out of
[01:25:51] prison yeah that [ __ ] must have been
[01:25:53] haunting yeah [ __ ] up every night oh my
[01:25:55] God every night I'm I'm I'm sitting in
[01:25:57] the [ __ ] in my bunk thinking and then
[01:26:00] I I I knew the date he was getting out
[01:26:02] of prison and like you know you can't
[01:26:04] just get on the phone and call hey Mom
[01:26:06] what's going on you know no you're in
[01:26:07] boot camp you get like every now and
[01:26:09] then they say okay you have like a phone
[01:26:10] call once a week or some [ __ ] I think
[01:26:12] every Sunday was a phone
[01:26:14] call and I'll never forget when he got
[01:26:16] to the house man I actually
[01:26:19] got I was [ __ ] not right so I got
[01:26:22] recycled so a week in boot camp so like
[01:26:26] I [ __ ] I don't know what I [ __ ]
[01:26:28] did something in boot camp and [ __ ]
[01:26:29] got recycled had like I was sneaking the
[01:26:31] Snickers bars I was just all kind of
[01:26:33] belligerant and [ __ ] I was just out of
[01:26:35] it I I was I was sneaking out and this
[01:26:37] [ __ ] I was just [ __ ] not right I
[01:26:40] was wasn't right and so then I um yeah
[01:26:43] that's it was [ __ ] up it's it's [ __ ]
[01:26:46] up what was it like when you met
[01:26:48] him I try to be supportive cuz that's
[01:26:51] what I always did my mom whatever made
[01:26:53] her happy I try to that that was my
[01:26:55] [ __ ] number one priority was I I
[01:26:57] never cared about myself never never
[01:27:01] ever which makes what I do now for
[01:27:06] people I I
[01:27:09] understand because I care about people
[01:27:11] even though I'm an introvert I'm an
[01:27:13] introvert because my [ __ ] life
[01:27:15] sucked but what I do for people I really
[01:27:18] do that's why I want to make sure that
[01:27:20] [ __ ] like that that [ __ ] book and
[01:27:22] things I do that's why I don't [ __ ]
[01:27:23] like why don't you sell [ __ ] why don't
[01:27:25] you always you know why aren't you like
[01:27:27] promoting this and that and no man no I
[01:27:30] care that you understand that I [ __ ]
[01:27:32] want to see you [ __ ] kill
[01:27:34] [ __ ] I want to see you better so you
[01:27:38] know when I met him I was supportive and
[01:27:40] I was and I sat back and looked at him
[01:27:42] and I wanted to [ __ ] beat this
[01:27:43] [ __ ] down so bad because I knew
[01:27:45] like you're not a good egg bro you're
[01:27:48] not a good egg man I'm not saying yeah I
[01:27:50] mean you know I'm not saying prisoners
[01:27:53] are B
[01:27:55] they can be re
[01:27:57] rehabilitated but I always had these
[01:28:00] feelings about people if I get around
[01:28:03] you I can [ __ ] I I may not tell you
[01:28:06] but when you grow up the way I grow up
[01:28:07] man you have this you have these ways of
[01:28:09] knowing pieces of [ __ ] I became an
[01:28:12] expert in pieces of [ __ ] I used to be
[01:28:16] one my dad was one so you can [ __ ]
[01:28:19] pick him out you can pick out liars and
[01:28:20] all kind of K artists from from a mile
[01:28:22] away cuz [ __ ] I studied it
[01:28:25] studied myself I know who you are so you
[01:28:28] can't come around me bullshitting me man
[01:28:30] can't right
[01:28:32] so it's just it was horrible it was
[01:28:35] horrible so you know like the the one
[01:28:37] woman I cared about more than anything
[01:28:39] in the world cuz I saw her hell I'm
[01:28:43] looking at this [ __ ] now and now I'm
[01:28:45] have to go to [ __ ] PA rescue school
[01:28:48] and all this other [ __ ] while she's
[01:28:49] [ __ ] with this guy so there are a lot
[01:28:51] of things in my mind that that just made
[01:28:54] hard that I studied I studied my mind
[01:28:57] during these times I started and this
[01:29:00] this process to become who am today of
[01:29:03] learning life and how hard life is
[01:29:06] that's why I don't speak about the good
[01:29:07] times everybody gets so mad why don't
[01:29:08] you speak about the good times I don't
[01:29:10] need to help you through those brother I
[01:29:14] do not need to help you you don't turn
[01:29:15] on David Goggins to for the good times
[01:29:19] you turn on David Goggins when you don't
[01:29:21] feel like doing [ __ ] you're an expert in
[01:29:23] dark matter dark [ __ ] matter
[01:29:26] that's what I am so yeah I know it
[01:29:30] really well so it wasn't like I wished
[01:29:32] for it one of the things that's
[01:29:35] hilarious in the book is that
[01:29:37] you you read all the [ __ ] that people
[01:29:41] write to you all the
[01:29:43] hate and you record it and then you play
[01:29:47] it back brother I'm G to tell you right
[01:29:50] now man that started honestly when this
[01:29:54] [ __ ] seal from SEAL Team
[01:29:56] Six came out and started lying his
[01:29:59] [ __ ] ass off about me this is an
[01:30:02] important subject we should talk about
[01:30:04] this cuz your military career and the
[01:30:07] what you've done is always
[01:30:09] misrepresented oh yeah even by people
[01:30:12] that should know better oh yeah oh they
[01:30:13] know better but what what makes people
[01:30:15] feel good like when when you become
[01:30:18] successful when you become successful
[01:30:20] and I had to realize this and this guy
[01:30:22] made me realize this
[01:30:24] I had to study them when you become
[01:30:27] successful especially within a
[01:30:30] fraternity like that like this is this
[01:30:33] is a fraternity bro this isn't like a
[01:30:35] [ __ ] like oh like in the Air Force
[01:30:38] you know it was this is a very different
[01:30:40] world so several seals no I'm going to
[01:30:43] say there's a lot that would like to see
[01:30:46] me [ __ ] a lot they like to see a lot
[01:30:47] of people not do well and them do great
[01:30:50] yeah and like they all know we eat our
[01:30:52] own we eat our own and that's what they
[01:30:54] all say we eat our own is that all seals
[01:30:57] I don't know all seals a lot of seals I
[01:30:59] can't speak that way I know a few seals
[01:31:01] is it just the hyper competitive nature
[01:31:03] of the type of people to get involved
[01:31:05] yeah it's like you know we have this
[01:31:07] this uh this this this mcho
[01:31:10] stigma that you know like you know we're
[01:31:13] we're the best of the best we're [ __ ]
[01:31:15] we're we're we're the bad [ __ ]
[01:31:16] in the world and and I I beg to differ
[01:31:20] you know like people go like I've had so
[01:31:21] many people in art like the news
[01:31:24] oh my God they contact me all they want
[01:31:27] me so bad cuz there's been some things
[01:31:29] that came up you know the Navy SE
[01:31:31] Community um this this guy died this
[01:31:33] this kid going through training died and
[01:31:36] some Navy Seals I don't know the stories
[01:31:39] they can Google it where the [ __ ] I
[01:31:40] guess they kill somebody over in Iraq
[01:31:43] who has some information some [ __ ] so
[01:31:45] they always want to get me on so I can
[01:31:48] [ __ ] because they know that I was not a
[01:31:51] fan of a lot of Navy SEALs and a lot of
[01:31:54] it is to do of with the lies the [ __ ]
[01:31:57] some of the leadership problems some of
[01:31:59] the character issues and I got to see
[01:32:02] that a lot when I got out and I'm the
[01:32:04] one to say it I had a lot of problems
[01:32:06] myself when I was growing up and it took
[01:32:08] a long time for me go so I'm not judging
[01:32:11] these people I know where the [ __ ] comes
[01:32:12] from man the [ __ ] comes from [ __ ] you
[01:32:14] haven't handled so I it doesn't even
[01:32:18] bother me anymore but when I came
[01:32:21] out um in 2018
[01:32:24] this this still from still Team Six he
[01:32:27] had and Jennifer it pissed Jennifer off
[01:32:29] so [ __ ] bad and I was cool about it
[01:32:32] but this guy started YouTube channels
[01:32:34] saying that I was dishonestly discharged
[01:32:37] I [ __ ] was kicked out of the SEAL
[01:32:39] Teams I um I refused to fight in combat
[01:32:43] I never went to combat I mean every bit
[01:32:46] of it so the reason why in my and can't
[01:32:50] hurt me I have my write up of my metal
[01:32:53] from
[01:32:54] Iraq and I wasn't going to put that in
[01:32:56] there but Jennifer started getting DMS
[01:32:58] from people saying do you know I'm not
[01:33:01] I'm not even going to name his name
[01:33:03] that's not who I am dude and I just
[01:33:04] showed you outside about that one cat
[01:33:06] yeah I'm not gonna name his name either
[01:33:09] but I'm not going to name his name
[01:33:10] because how does he not know better
[01:33:12] though that's the the the that was one
[01:33:15] of the things that people bring up that
[01:33:17] you never deployed right yep why would
[01:33:20] they say that why you think Joe think
[01:33:24] about it man think about it see like
[01:33:26] this the thing but that's something
[01:33:27] that's easily proven exactly but guess
[01:33:29] what this guy had Black Ops literally he
[01:33:32] was he was he had like YouTube channels
[01:33:35] dming people because people like at this
[01:33:37] time I started getting a little bigger I
[01:33:39] started getting a little more profile
[01:33:41] and he was coming out of the SEAL Teams
[01:33:43] I'm not gonna say his name because I'm
[01:33:45] not going to try to take food out of his
[01:33:46] mouth and this is one thing I learned
[01:33:48] from all of this I had this I was so
[01:33:51] [ __ ] pissed man I was so [ __ ]
[01:33:54] pissed I didn't deploy I mean the
[01:33:55] [ __ ] lies were insane how many times
[01:33:57] did you deploy twice one to Guam and one
[01:34:02] to Iraq and then what they don't talk
[01:34:04] about though is the reason I didn't
[01:34:05] deploy more is I had two heart
[01:34:08] surgeries so I was out of the [ __ ]
[01:34:10] teams for deploying for like three four
[01:34:12] years because the heart surgeries
[01:34:15] because when you get a heart Sur you
[01:34:16] can't go back to deploy you were born
[01:34:17] with like holes in your heart right with
[01:34:19] a hole in my heart and the first surgery
[01:34:21] it didn't you know it didn't take try to
[01:34:23] get another surgery so that took so much
[01:34:24] time having these heart surgeries so I
[01:34:27] was in um recruiting at the time so this
[01:34:30] kept me in recruiting so this even added
[01:34:33] to the whole [ __ ] this added to the
[01:34:35] whole [ __ ] so they were loving it
[01:34:37] because right now like I said I wouldn't
[01:34:39] like the most famous seal within the
[01:34:41] SEAL
[01:34:42] Teams I didn't take [ __ ] man it [ __ ] was
[01:34:45] [ __ ] up I called it I called it
[01:34:47] there's there's no secret there there's
[01:34:49] no secret [ __ ] here man and and and I
[01:34:52] knew what happened when I when I got out
[01:34:55] and this guy started doing this [ __ ] and
[01:34:57] I I knew why he was doing it because the
[01:35:00] biggest thing like he wanted to take my
[01:35:02] character and destroy it right that's
[01:35:04] all he wanted to do and so when you're
[01:35:06] in these kind of communities like this
[01:35:08] man people like oh no there's no way he
[01:35:10] was trying to do that man I wish I can
[01:35:13] get Jennifer here right now we have all
[01:35:15] the screenshots and I had to get a
[01:35:17] [ __ ]
[01:35:17] lawyer I mean this guy went so far and
[01:35:21] then what happened was over a period of
[01:35:22] time he [ __ ]
[01:35:24] literally apologized went away [ __ ]
[01:35:28] took all this [ __ ] down I mean but he
[01:35:31] came out and but what happened was that
[01:35:33] rumor mill spread like wildfire did he
[01:35:36] have to know did he have to be told
[01:35:39] about your actual record no he knew
[01:35:42] never I deployed with him what I
[01:35:45] deployed with him in Iraq no in Iraq he
[01:35:50] was just lying in Iraq I deployed with
[01:35:53] him in the only [ __ ] see man you got get
[01:35:54] me to the point where I say his [ __ ]
[01:35:56] name because I swear to God so I
[01:35:59] deployed with his ass that's why I put
[01:36:00] the [ __ ] right up in there so I got a
[01:36:03] medal over there in Iraq I got a medal
[01:36:06] in Iraq so I did go to war and I put it
[01:36:11] in the book Because when because
[01:36:12] Jennifer started getting all this [ __ ]
[01:36:14] and she goes you got to put that [ __ ]
[01:36:15] award in there because this [ __ ]
[01:36:17] is just ly his ass off I didn't go to
[01:36:19] Ranger school all this [ __ ] so I put the
[01:36:21] Ranger school everything he said
[01:36:24] I put in can't hurt me because he was
[01:36:26] just literally lying trying to literally
[01:36:28] ruin who I was cuz I'm the world's
[01:36:31] toughest man that doesn't sit right with
[01:36:33] some [ __ ] Alpha [ __ ] dude
[01:36:36] and these [ __ ] dude some of
[01:36:38] them and you don't know unless you've
[01:36:40] been in the fraternity like this unless
[01:36:43] you've been in the fraternity like this
[01:36:44] you don't [ __ ] know I don't [ __ ]
[01:36:45] care about them there's some I some
[01:36:47] great friends in there but anyway the
[01:36:50] reason this guy actually helped me out
[01:36:52] so when I came out there's a few guys in
[01:36:55] that came after me in the seel teams
[01:36:57] trying to make sure that I [ __ ]
[01:36:59] wasn't going to be who I am and they
[01:37:00] still talk their [ __ ] lies
[01:37:03] lies so many [ __ ] lies dude and
[01:37:06] what's great about is my proof isn't
[01:37:08] can't hurt me so everything they say my
[01:37:10] proof is in and that's why it's designed
[01:37:12] that way for the Liars but this guy came
[01:37:14] out and what I do is I studied him so
[01:37:18] Jennifer goty lawyer I'm about to sue
[01:37:20] the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] guy man
[01:37:21] like I had all this defamation I mean it
[01:37:23] was [ __ ] a thick I was going to sue
[01:37:25] the [ __ ] out of him and every night I
[01:37:27] [ __ ] woke
[01:37:29] up I was like man I started think about
[01:37:31] myself when I was a piece of [ __ ] when I
[01:37:34] had no character when I had no pride no
[01:37:37] dignity that's CU only people that do
[01:37:39] [ __ ] like that you're not a man right
[01:37:41] you're no [ __ ] man dude like I start
[01:37:43] thinking about what kind of [ __ ] you
[01:37:44] are man what how you must have so many
[01:37:48] [ __ ] demons in your life that you
[01:37:49] spend this kind of time just trying to
[01:37:51] take another man just trying to take
[01:37:52] another man and not
[01:37:54] I it'd be different if it was truth
[01:37:55] behind it right lies [ __ ] lies yeah
[01:37:59] just because we didn't get along
[01:38:00] [ __ ] it don't mean I wasn't who
[01:38:04] I am we didn't get along [ __ ]
[01:38:06] cuz I [ __ ] I'm like a lie detector
[01:38:09] cuz I'm so [ __ ] honest with myself I
[01:38:10] had such a hard time in my life that I
[01:38:12] [ __ ] so forthright when you get even
[01:38:15] near
[01:38:16] me cuz I [ __ ] you know my [ __ ] is
[01:38:18] real it's [ __ ] real as [ __ ] it makes

[01:38:26] [ __ ] life I Ain open my [ __ ] mouth
[01:38:28] you know my [ __ ] is [ __ ] real yeah I
[01:38:30] may not deployed as many times you
[01:38:32] [ __ ] because my heart issues and
[01:38:33] the other issues that I won't talk about
[01:38:35] cuz the [ __ ] news wants me to [ __ ]
[01:38:37] talk about this [ __ ] so bad they want to
[01:38:38] take some Ste down so bad I ain't no
[01:38:41] [ __ ] like that whatever happened to se
[01:38:43] teams with me it happened to SEAL Teams
[01:38:46] that's why I don't [ __ ] mention the
[01:38:47] names but I saw these little [ __ ]
[01:38:48] come out here it was in the fraternity
[01:38:50] it happened in the fraternity leave it
[01:38:52] there don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] come out
[01:38:54] here [ __ ] spreading lies about me
[01:38:56] [ __ ] but I studied all these
[01:38:58] little [ __ ] who try to come out and
[01:38:59] ruin my life studied all of them like
[01:39:02] man what you must be going through is
[01:39:05] [ __ ] evil I even took a step further
[01:39:08] I had to mature myself because I was so
[01:39:10] [ __ ] mad and I looked at his family
[01:39:13] this guy who was talking this [ __ ] I G
[01:39:14] to say his name so bad but I never will
[01:39:17] because that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] move on
[01:39:18] my
[01:39:19] part you can take food out of this
[01:39:22] [ __ ] his family's mouth
[01:39:23] you're G to have this guy in the
[01:39:25] courthouse you have him in the courtroom
[01:39:27] spending money on
[01:39:30] lawyers and I [ __ ] just [ __ ]
[01:39:32] dropped it I said I'm good I said I know
[01:39:33] who the [ __ ] I am I said you can wake up
[01:39:36] every [ __ ] morning being the [ __ ]
[01:39:37] that you are but I'm not going to
[01:39:39] [ __ ] take money out of your pocket
[01:39:41] and money out of your mouth out of your
[01:39:42] [ __ ] kids kids mouth and this kid
[01:39:44] this guy wound up apologizing to you he
[01:39:46] didn't apologized to me what happened
[01:39:49] was he got on and I don't want to go too
[01:39:52] deep because they will figure it out
[01:39:54] but um he ended up basically saying he's
[01:39:57] he had a
[01:39:58] [ __ ] he he just wasn't he wasn't
[01:40:01] right in his head he was he was you know
[01:40:03] he wasn't good I and I can tell he
[01:40:05] wasn't good because he was literally
[01:40:07] dming people and I I wish I had Jennifer
[01:40:08] in here man so she can show you the DMS
[01:40:11] he was deeming people and talking all
[01:40:13] this [ __ ] and then he would delete it
[01:40:16] and this guy H how so so so Jennifer
[01:40:18] found it and so cuz this guy dm'
[01:40:20] Jennifer and was like um hey can you do
[01:40:24] you do you know this guy and I was like
[01:40:26] yeah I know him and then J was like Hey
[01:40:28] we got to [ __ ] shut this [ __ ] down
[01:40:30] but he was DM and several people just
[01:40:32] saying that I was dis AR be discharged I
[01:40:35] was kicked out of the SEAL Teams I
[01:40:37] refused to go to combat um he just went
[01:40:40] on and on and on and so this guy was
[01:40:42] taking screenshots of what of what this
[01:40:45] guy was saying and sending them to us
[01:40:48] and so at this time now we have a lawyer
[01:40:50] and so we're were getting all this [ __ ]
[01:40:52] dude and then he had a YouTube site
[01:40:53] setup that he took down just trying to
[01:40:56] literally ruin who I was and I looked at
[01:40:59] all this [ __ ] and I studied them I was
[01:41:02] like man you got and what came out later
[01:41:04] on was he did have some demons he does
[01:41:07] have some Demons of course he does
[01:41:08] serious demons that's how insane it is
[01:41:10] that the guy deployed with you SEAL Team
[01:41:13] Six and these [ __ ] supposed to
[01:41:15] be bass [ __ ] see this is this is
[01:41:17] some of the issues I had when I was in
[01:41:20] is that when you work so hard
[01:41:24] man I put these [ __ ] like I
[01:41:25] talked about last time I was on this
[01:41:26] [ __ ] [ __ ] on a pedestal half the
[01:41:29] reason I ran on broken legs half the
[01:41:31] reason why I [ __ ] became who I became
[01:41:34] was because of the the
[01:41:37] image these guys had on me I was so
[01:41:41] impressed with the books and the [ __ ]
[01:41:44] and the and the and the people that they
[01:41:46] were I was like my God man I got to be a
[01:41:48] [ __ ] God I got to be a god mentally
[01:41:52] to [ __ ] get in here and once I got in
[01:41:56] I discovered something different I'm not
[01:41:58] saying that I'm not saying everybody I'm
[01:42:00] not I don't know everybody in the seel
[01:42:02] teams but I had a problem with the fact
[01:42:04] that a lot of people lived
[01:42:07] this this [ __ ] like a lot of the
[01:42:10] civilians like oh my God the seals are
[01:42:12] this the seals are that you were able to
[01:42:14] run badwater 135 because you're a Navy
[01:42:17] SEAL and because they like no
[01:42:21] [ __ ] that ain't why and I always
[01:42:23] knew the [ __ ] and I had issues with it
[01:42:25] man I had issues with it so I had a
[01:42:27] [ __ ] I had issues with it a lot of
[01:42:28] people didn't like that and then I went
[01:42:30] on to go and recruiting for a little bit
[01:42:32] and then the heart surgeries happened so
[01:42:34] the more I was in recruiting the more I
[01:42:35] was that [ __ ] happened they just started
[01:42:38] slowly building up lies slowly building
[01:42:41] up lies and I came out to I was I told
[01:42:43] Jennifer I and I knew it I said
[01:42:47] standby stand by it's coming whenever
[01:42:51] you're a person that gets
[01:42:53] what other people think is attention
[01:42:55] that they think they deserve yes sir
[01:42:57] that's when things get weird oh yeah
[01:42:59] that's why they bring those [ __ ]
[01:42:59] deployments because they think oh my God
[01:43:01] you didn't deploy as much as me you
[01:43:03] didn't deploy as much as me he was this
[01:43:04] he's not known for being for for
[01:43:06] deploying and [ __ ] yeah [ __ ]
[01:43:09] don't care yeah I have I have a combat
[01:43:11] deployment and I deployed another time
[01:43:13] that we were supposed to it was right
[01:43:14] during 9/11 we were supposed to go and
[01:43:17] they [ __ ] had us over in Guam we were
[01:43:18] all pissed off didn't work out that way
[01:43:20] but I got over there and what's funny
[01:43:22] about it this is this is what makes me
[01:43:24] laugh so much there's a lot of Navy C
[01:43:25] who never deployed over combat ever
[01:43:29] ever and it makes me laugh because
[01:43:33] [ __ ] want to act like one
[01:43:35] combat deployment where I fought for my
[01:43:37] [ __ ] country it's
[01:43:40] [ __ ] think about that fought from my
[01:43:42] [ __ ] country did my [ __ ] sorry it
[01:43:45] worked out the way it worked out
[01:43:48] and that's that's a that's not enough I
[01:43:52] think it part part of the problem with
[01:43:53] some of those guys is when guys are
[01:43:56] seriously Alpha and they think they go
[01:43:58] above and beyond and they push harder
[01:44:01] than anybody and then they meet you and
[01:44:05] you're the guy that's getting up at 3:30
[01:44:06] in the morning yelling at them while
[01:44:08] you're running like I know you're
[01:44:09] sleeping I know you're still in bed
[01:44:12] [ __ ] I'm out here running 10
[01:44:13] miles before you eat breakfast that's
[01:44:15] half the reason I did it yeah that's
[01:44:17] half the reason that [ __ ] going
[01:44:18] to [ __ ] halisco and [ __ ] getting
[01:44:20] waffle breakfast and [ __ ] bacing and
[01:44:22] eggs [ __ ] that bothered me I said
[01:44:25] [ __ ] I got my family and
[01:44:26] everybody thinking I'm some [ __ ] stud
[01:44:29] and you all just got to [ __ ] lift
[01:44:30] some weights y'all don't want to [ __ ]
[01:44:31] like I said I was in charge of PT and
[01:44:35] they're like Noah this ain't buzz goggin
[01:44:38] like man you got a lot of [ __ ]
[01:44:40] food this ain't everybody I don't know
[01:44:41] every seal I don't know every seal but
[01:44:43] you want to run your [ __ ] mouth about
[01:44:45] me and talk your little [ __ ] I got my
[01:44:48] secrets too and I won't say names cuz
[01:44:50] only a [ __ ] does that so keep on
[01:44:53] running your [ __ ] mouths I know all
[01:44:55] you [ __ ] so you started taking
[01:44:58] over PT yeah I was so when I got back so
[01:45:00] I went on my first deployment and when I
[01:45:03] came back off my first deployment I
[01:45:06] begged put seven chits in seven chits
[01:45:09] it's like a request chit to go to Ranger
[01:45:11] school [ __ ] don't request to go
[01:45:13] to Ranger school I wanted to go to
[01:45:16] Ranger school as a seal you went through
[01:45:18] buds whatever the [ __ ] you don't want to
[01:45:20] go to another course to get your ass
[01:45:21] kicked I did I did so much Ranger school
[01:45:24] came back honor man I was the enlisted
[01:45:26] honor man at Ranger school but they say
[01:45:28] I'm a bad operator they also say I'm a
[01:45:30] bad operator but guess what they had my
[01:45:32] black ass when I was [ __ ] in Iraq I
[01:45:35] was chared it's called PSD okay so
[01:45:38] you're like a bodyguard I'm a bad
[01:45:40] operator Joe but guess where I was I was
[01:45:44] the lead
[01:45:46] Navigator so I'm the eyes so everything
[01:45:49] we did was in the
[01:45:50] car it was my job to make sure that
[01:45:53] whole [ __ ] platoon was
[01:45:55] safe okay you're not going to put a dumb
[01:45:57] bad operator up there who's [ __ ] not
[01:45:59] good it's my job to make sure I called
[01:46:01] all the outs called all the trouble
[01:46:03] coming had to get us there safe we had
[01:46:05] the [ __ ] guy who was going for the
[01:46:07] prime minister's job who we a garden and
[01:46:10] they had a bad operator what they want
[01:46:13] to call me they want to say the little
[01:46:15] [ __ ] rumors I was the guy who let it
[01:46:17] and it was so good I did such a good job
[01:46:20] that there's two of us cuz the job's
[01:46:21] very stressful being a primary Navigator
[01:46:23] stressful so they have a primary and a
[01:46:25] secondary so some days I would do it
[01:46:27] some days another guy would do it I was
[01:46:29] doing such a good job Joe that they
[01:46:31] didn't want the other guy to do it so I
[01:46:33] became the only guy navigating us
[01:46:36] through [ __ ] Iraq all right and our
[01:46:39] guy didn't live in the green zone the
[01:46:40] green zone is a safe place our guy lived
[01:46:43] in the red zone so we had to go out in
[01:46:45] the Red Zone every day to get this
[01:46:46] [ __ ] guy bring it back in no there
[01:46:49] was no shoot him UPS cuz this one one
[01:46:51] rumor that was out there that came out
[01:46:53] from this guy was I
[01:46:55] froze I froze in a firefight it's kind
[01:46:58] of funny how you can freeze in a
[01:47:00] firefight when oure was never in
[01:47:03] morning so it's just just [ __ ] man
[01:47:06] but I know where it comes from I know
[01:47:09] where it comes from crabs in a bucket I
[01:47:10] know where it comes from my friend it's
[01:47:12] just crabs in a bucket that's it sorry
[01:47:14] sorry I became so successful guys that's
[01:47:16] what it is people don't like it when you
[01:47:18] did the same thing they did you come
[01:47:20] from the same fraternity but you get
[01:47:22] exort exorbitant amounts of attention
[01:47:24] and success oh yeah and instead of
[01:47:27] looking at that and going wow look what
[01:47:28] he did that's amazing I wish I did that
[01:47:32] or maybe I could do more or he's
[01:47:35] inspiring other people and that's great
[01:47:37] you know what though I will say this
[01:47:39] there's a there's a lot of them that do
[01:47:40] say that that's great there's a lot of
[01:47:42] them that do say this I have a guy named
[01:47:44] Hawk you know that that email I sent to
[01:47:46] you a while ago about this guy who wrote
[01:47:50] that email about the SEAL Teams and I
[01:47:52] shared it with you you about he's
[01:47:54] talking about like only 133% of you
[01:47:56] actually it's like anyway I sent email
[01:47:59] remember so anyway he's a guy that sent
[01:48:02] that email Hawk he's like my best friend
[01:48:04] so he uh bad [ __ ] when he when
[01:48:07] he got out of SE teams he wrote this
[01:48:09] email and sent out to like every Navy SE
[01:48:12] and it was like 87% of you [ __ ]
[01:48:15] he said 87% of you [ __ ] you
[01:48:18] know are are living off of one week and
[01:48:22] what he was talking about was hell week
[01:48:24] like that one week in hell week is all
[01:48:25] they're living off of cuz they're not
[01:48:27] living it now and he made these shirts
[01:48:30] called the 133% shirts and the other
[01:48:32] 133% guys are actually getting after it
[01:48:34] that [ __ ] sent me two of
[01:48:36] them all right he sent me two of them so
[01:48:39] yeah they're right I wish I could have
[01:48:41] deployed more and blah blah blah
[01:48:43] whatever and whatever man but I was I
[01:48:46] was a [ __ ] good seal and [ __ ] good
[01:48:49] teammate and some guys didn't like me
[01:48:51] and in the fraternity [ __ ] had it out
[01:48:53] and there's a time somebody [ __ ] did
[01:48:55] some [ __ ] but is what it is man you ever
[01:48:57] heard uh when people talk about some
[01:48:59] Union work one of the things that
[01:49:01] happens when you're in some unions is
[01:49:04] like if you're working too hard someone
[01:49:05] will come along go hey David slow the
[01:49:08] [ __ ]
[01:49:08] down Bad true statement like you're
[01:49:11] moving too many packages you're doing
[01:49:12] too much of this to too much of that
[01:49:15] you're setting the standard too high and
[01:49:16] you're [ __ ] it up for everybody else
[01:49:18] and so you'll have people that will
[01:49:19] sabotage someone mhm just because that
[01:49:22] person
[01:49:23] wants to work hard oh I see it but it
[01:49:26] made me grow it made me grow and I and
[01:49:28] I'm glad I didn't put a case on that guy
[01:49:31] and I'm glad I got a chance to study him
[01:49:33] and it is what it is man it is what it
[01:49:35] is and this is one part that I try to
[01:49:36] tell people and teach them if you're
[01:49:38] trying to go to that uncommon amongst
[01:49:41] the uncommon place it's a lonely
[01:49:44] [ __ ] up there man it's lonely
[01:49:46] I'm not saying I'm better than every
[01:49:47] [ __ ] body I'm not saying that and
[01:49:49] once again I'm not speaking for every
[01:49:51] seal I'm not but I just didn't I didn't
[01:49:54] try to be what they were what you're
[01:49:57] just saying is just a fact it's just a
[01:49:59] fact man it's just a fact and there
[01:50:02] there's people that are willing to go
[01:50:03] very far and then there's people that
[01:50:05] are willing to go far further than them
[01:50:07] that's it and when your person who
[01:50:09] prides yourself on your ability to go
[01:50:11] very far and then someone is willing to
[01:50:13] go far farther than you you have to
[01:50:16] decide do I want to look at that as the
[01:50:18] new standard do I want to judge myself
[01:50:21] do I want to admire him or do I want to
[01:50:24] try to take him down because I feel bad
[01:50:27] because I can't do what he does or
[01:50:28] haven't done what he does or what he
[01:50:30] does makes me look bad because I like to
[01:50:33] think I'm a hard worker I like to think
[01:50:36] I'm disciplined and hard and then I see
[01:50:38] this [ __ ] dude out there that just
[01:50:39] making me look soft right and so instead
[01:50:42] of just going look at him man [ __ ] yeah
[01:50:45] right instead of a smart person would
[01:50:48] look at that person as fuel but you have
[01:50:50] to make your own decisions too because
[01:50:52] you do
[01:50:54] requires a dedication that will
[01:50:57] eliminate a lot of things from your life
[01:50:58] that some people enjoy and think are
[01:51:01] important dude and also when you when I
[01:51:04] took the road cuz I knew what I was
[01:51:06] doing when you when you take that road
[01:51:08] and you just don't want to just fit in
[01:51:11] it's a lonely road it's a lonely road
[01:51:13] and you get a lot of haters man and like
[01:51:15] I tell people all the time
[01:51:17] man if I can walk on water [ __ ]
[01:51:20] would say because I couldn't swim
[01:51:23] tell that right the [ __ ] now yeah tell
[01:51:25] that right now and and this is a true
[01:51:27] statement I used to get so mad like I
[01:51:29] said about this [ __ ] [ __ ] man but I
[01:51:31] sat back one day I was like you know
[01:51:32] what all these people hating on me man
[01:51:34] like I have a guy who's trying to who's
[01:51:36] trying to write a book saying that I was
[01:51:38] telling people he's a famous author like
[01:51:40] I'll never drop names dude I'm not
[01:51:41] trying to hurt your business but you're
[01:51:42] funny these people are funny keep on
[01:51:45] talking your [ __ ] I will absorb it and
[01:51:47] make a mixtape out of your [ __ ] ass
[01:51:49] like I do he tried to tell he he was
[01:51:52] going to write book that I was telling
[01:51:55] people to run until your kidneys got
[01:51:58] [ __ ] up that my mentality of running
[01:52:00] is is I was telling people I was telling
[01:52:02] people to run into your kidneys got
[01:52:04] [ __ ] up to run until you get wbed up
[01:52:06] run until you get wbed up that's he was
[01:52:07] going to he's going to write a book and
[01:52:09] the premise was the way I think compared
[01:52:13] to the way he thinks I never told a
[01:52:15] [ __ ] in my
[01:52:17] life I tell you to do better and go as
[01:52:20] far as you can I don't tell you to go
[01:52:22] until you [ __ ] kill yourself until
[01:52:24] you get rabo but I will tell you this
[01:52:27] Joe you will never never in
[01:52:30] life meet a hater doing better than you
[01:52:34] that's a fact ever so when I [ __ ]
[01:52:37] realize that and Jennifer gets so mad at
[01:52:40] the lies she hears and this and that
[01:52:42] because it comes all through they spew
[01:52:43] it yeah I told Jennifer that [ __ ] man
[01:52:46] stop yeah [ __ ] calm down bro don't
[01:52:49] stop sending me that [ __ ] 100% factual
[01:52:51] there's there we were we were talking
[01:52:53] about in the bathroom earlier I was like
[01:52:55] you got a amount of bandwidth in your
[01:52:58] mind yep whatever that those units are
[01:53:00] let called a hundred hundred of of those
[01:53:02] things in your mind the moment you start
[01:53:04] entertaining haters you start reading
[01:53:07] comments you're stealing your bandwidth
[01:53:10] that you could apply to your loved ones
[01:53:13] that you could apply to the thing that
[01:53:14] you love to do that you could apply to
[01:53:16] making your life better you're stealing
[01:53:19] from yourself when you pay attention
[01:53:21] like I was talking about clearing that
[01:53:23] space out yeah and that space allows you
[01:53:25] to make more room for what's important
[01:53:27] in your life yeah if your mind's still
[01:53:28] clutter man you can't do [ __ ] there's
[01:53:30] also a thing about you being a public
[01:53:31] person being a public person now you
[01:53:33] have access to way more haters than the
[01:53:36] the
[01:53:37] average the average person knows a few
[01:53:40] haters maybe if you're a good-look woman
[01:53:42] and you got some [ __ ] in the office
[01:53:43] like to talk [ __ ] about you or if you're
[01:53:45] a guy who's like you know getting after
[01:53:47] it early and being disciplined and you
[01:53:49] you you make people intimidated by your
[01:53:52] ambition you're going to have some
[01:53:54] haters you're going to be people lying
[01:53:55] about you there's going to be but you
[01:53:57] have no idea what it's like to be a
[01:54:01] public person like
[01:54:03] yourself and the kind of haters that you
[01:54:05] must experience because if you paid
[01:54:07] attention to them all day long you would
[01:54:09] have no time for anything else no I
[01:54:11] never get in 2013 when I was first you
[01:54:14] know Jennifer knows about this [ __ ] I
[01:54:17] cussed everybody we had this [ __ ]
[01:54:19] round table and every was like man he
[01:54:20] have such a great story you need to tell
[01:54:22] it you need to get on social media and
[01:54:24] blah blah blah I cussed everybody out
[01:54:26] [ __ ] you I'm not [ __ ] going on that
[01:54:29] [ __ ] [ __ ] that's a bunch of [ __ ]
[01:54:31] [ __ ] lying it's it's the
[01:54:33] devil and the second I [ __ ] got on
[01:54:37] that [ __ ] dude it is the [ __ ] devil
[01:54:40] Instagram and social media man I had
[01:54:42] this [ __ ] kid man who [ __ ]
[01:54:44] literally the reason I talk about haters
[01:54:46] so much is this little boy his parents
[01:54:49] reached out to me and he was getting so
[01:54:51] much hate at school and we get so many
[01:54:54] emails I can't check them all and but I
[01:54:57] get to them but later on much like two
[01:54:59] or three months later so this guy wrote
[01:55:02] us and this kid was having a hard time
[01:55:05] with bullies and when I got to his email
[01:55:08] I got to it called his family up said
[01:55:10] hey what's going on you know David Gaga
[01:55:11] they were all happy to hear it he had
[01:55:13] killed
[01:55:14] himself so
[01:55:17] like I in the back of my [ __ ] mind
[01:55:21] and what hurt me the most was when I
[01:55:24] read the [ __ ]
[01:55:25] email and uh Oho [ __ ] I get my [ __ ]
[01:55:29] together I wasn't gonna bring this [ __ ]
[01:55:32] up I I I I read the email and they said
[01:55:35] he can you know you can help her son
[01:55:38] know our son really admires you that's
[01:55:40] why I um I'm so I'm I'm I'm I'm very
[01:55:44] vocal for a lot of
[01:55:45] reasons but I have to be strong because
[01:55:49] I know a lot of people aren't so you
[01:55:51] know that's why don't cower from [ __ ]
[01:55:54] you know at all you want to [ __ ] you
[01:55:56] know I've I'll take on whatever whatever
[01:55:58] challenge is in front of me I take it on
[01:56:00] because a lot of people don't have that
[01:56:02] that courage and it's hard to be brave
[01:56:04] it's [ __ ] hard to speak up for what
[01:56:06] you believe in and they they wrote this
[01:56:09] great email to me and they want me to
[01:56:12] talk to their son son was a big follower
[01:56:14] of mine and he uh so I called he's like
[01:56:18] yeah and it was a silent a very silent
[01:56:22] um
[01:56:23] pause and they told me what happened and
[01:56:26] um he hung himself and I was like it was
[01:56:29] [ __ ] up so you know that's why another
[01:56:32] reason I hate I hate being a public
[01:56:35] figure because it's not a public figure
[01:56:37] that I am like it's funny um I hang
[01:56:41] around some people who are real public
[01:56:42] figures you know like
[01:56:44] celebrities and I have people coming to
[01:56:46] me first like I'm talking of famous
[01:56:50] [ __ ] and people come to me me
[01:56:52] first and and they want to share their
[01:56:55] story in their life with me about how
[01:56:57] they changed and that's a massive
[01:56:59] responsibility that people don't
[01:57:01] understand
[01:57:02] like um when they come to you and they
[01:57:04] share the demons that they've gone
[01:57:06] through and and the hard [ __ ] the
[01:57:08] hardships that they've gone through and
[01:57:10] um and they say you and your book and
[01:57:14] and what you've done and your social
[01:57:15] media page that's why I make sure I want
[01:57:17] to go at people so hard Joe sometimes

[01:57:21] man and lying [ __ ] I make sure that my

[01:58:16] trying to live you're trying to set the
[01:58:18] standard when you're trying to be the
[01:58:20] standard and that standard is I you know
[01:58:22] there's so much going wrong and going
[01:58:24] off in this world that if people can
[01:58:27] focus on themselves being better versus
[01:58:30] throwing hate and [ __ ] all this [ __ ]
[01:58:32] that happens out there and people
[01:58:33] talking [ __ ] running that's why I won't
[01:58:35] mention no [ __ ] names not
[01:58:36] trying to hurt you man but I'm trying to
[01:58:39] be the standard and sometimes life is

[01:59:50] my favorite people are crazy
[01:59:52] yes you know but I don't I don't look at
[01:59:54] it as a negative I look at it as a
[01:59:56] strength it is I I see a person who's
[01:59:59] willing to go to that dark matter place
[02:00:01] I go oh I like that oh yeah I like that
[02:00:03] but you went there during sober October
[02:00:05] man you went there you went there so
[02:00:08] how' that feel man when you [ __ ] were
[02:00:09] going into those Journeys into those
[02:00:11] compartments well what I like about it
[02:00:13] is that you had to do it every day you
[02:00:16] know and so I just every day would you
[02:00:20] know know it was coming go hey all right
[02:00:23] here we go time to get going and every
[02:00:24] day just get after it in some crazy way
[02:00:28] one of my favorite things is the thing
[02:00:30] that I hate the most it's airdine
[02:00:32] Sprints I do those Tabata sprints on the
[02:00:35] airdine machine oh the [ __ ] Echo Bike
[02:00:38] yeah the Echo Bike from Rogue 20 second
[02:00:40] Sprints 10 second rest 20 second do
[02:00:42] cycles of eight so eight rounds of that
[02:00:45] and then I would do another one and
[02:00:47] another one and another one I was doing
[02:00:49] an hour at that that's [ __ ] brutal
[02:00:52] so hard but it but when it was done I'm
[02:00:56] standing in a puddle I'm completely
[02:00:58] drenched but that feeling of getting
[02:01:01] through this cu the last Cycles when
[02:01:05] you're doing like and you look like cuz
[02:01:06] the Rogue bike will show you like you've
[02:01:08] done three which means you have to you
[02:01:10] have to do five more of these Sprints
[02:01:12] and that 10 seconds just non-existent
[02:01:15] she
[02:01:16] like and then tekken's
[02:01:20] like it's it's so quick and then you're
[02:01:22] back at it again those last ones are so
[02:01:24] hard but when you get through it the
[02:01:27] rest of the day is so much better that's
[02:01:29] like fight training man because the
[02:01:30] month of November all I've been doing is
[02:01:32] drinking really oh man I've been working
[02:01:34] out still working out but we're doing a
[02:01:36] lot of drinking and I'm like this I got
[02:01:38] to stop so I woke up today because
[02:01:40] today's December 1st I'm like I'm not
[02:01:42] drinking this month I'll have a glass of
[02:01:44] wine on Christmas or something like that
[02:01:46] but this month I'm back to the Grind are
[02:01:48] you cuz yeah yeah cuz I enjoyed October
[02:01:51] this
[02:01:53] suck when it's over it's life is better
[02:01:57] well you know you just got to get
[02:01:58] through the suck that's right and then
[02:02:00] life is better but the thing that gets
[02:02:02] me is the level of I don't give a [ __ ]
[02:02:06] and anxi the less the the lack of
[02:02:09] anxiety that comes after you work out
[02:02:11] every day is so worth the workout you're
[02:02:15] so calm so calm the only thing that
[02:02:17] changes your [ __ ]
[02:02:19] DNA is discipline yes dis the only thing
[02:02:22] that changes your DNA man is the only
[02:02:24] thing only thing man you could be
[02:02:25] [ __ ] so [ __ ] up and I realized that
[02:02:27] man I was like man the only thing that
[02:02:29] changeed my DNA is discipline know what
[02:02:33] I'm saying I've Incorporated a new thing
[02:02:34] that I was telling you where I get up
[02:02:36] first thing in the morning I get in the
[02:02:37] cold plunge cuz I was doing the cold
[02:02:39] plunge after I did the sauna and it's a
[02:02:42] little easier cuz the sauna sucks right
[02:02:45] but you know when that 20 minutes is up
[02:02:47] or 25 minutes is up and then you get in
[02:02:48] that cold the cold sucks but it doesn't
[02:02:51] suck suck as much as when you're cold
[02:02:53] and then you get in the cold so when I
[02:02:55] wake up in the morning I don't dress
[02:02:57] warm I wear my [ __ ] underwear and I
[02:02:59] go outside and it's 40° this morning and
[02:03:02] I walk out and I lift the lid on that
[02:03:04] morosgo cold plunge and I see the
[02:03:06] [ __ ] ice floating up in there and
[02:03:08] every day I climb in that's brutal and I
[02:03:11] just get in there for 3 minutes in the
[02:03:13] morning and then I work out that's
[02:03:15] [ __ ] brutal because I read this thing
[02:03:17] um I'll send it to you Jamie but I read
[02:03:19] this thing where uh they've been doing
[02:03:23] studies on what happens to people Andrew
[02:03:25] huberman and I actually discussed this
[02:03:28] and huberman's a very interesting guy
[02:03:31] but um it's about the benefits of cold
[02:03:34] plunge before you
[02:03:37] actually work out really yeah cuz
[02:03:40] there's a benefit after you work out in
[02:03:42] terms of reduction of inflammation but
[02:03:45] what they're saying is you shouldn't do
[02:03:47] it right after you lift weights got it
[02:03:49] got it because then Muses yeah it it
[02:03:52] actually decreases the hypertrophy so
[02:03:55] you don't gain as much mass or gain as
[02:03:57] much strength but there's some benefit
[02:04:01] to doing it before you work out I think
[02:04:03] there's a a link involved in that
[02:04:07] too so anyway this is a
[02:04:10] guy uh who's talking about prostate
[02:04:13] specific antigen blood te test came back
[02:04:17] uh very high and everyone said that he
[02:04:19] had to get a biopsy and he said the
[02:04:21] story I've heard about old older men
[02:04:23] getting biopsies in prostate ectomies
[02:04:26] sounded like nightmares to him so he
[02:04:28] decided to try to manage his PSA with
[02:04:30] ketosis and Ice baths so it worked his
[02:04:34] PSA dropped from over seven to less than
[02:04:37] one and along the way a funny thing
[02:04:39] happened to his testosterone it went
[02:04:41] through the roof to 1140 which is crazy
[02:04:45] high his he said my urologist didn't
[02:04:47] believe me he thought I must be juicing
[02:04:50] so he had my luteinizing hor hormones
[02:04:51] tested 2 sure enough 8.9 is off the
[02:04:54] charts for a fat guy in his 50s he said
[02:04:58] then I did a research and I discovered a
[02:04:59] Japanese study from 1991 that showed the
[02:05:02] secret was exercising after your ice
[02:05:05] bath it's the opposite of what everybody
[02:05:07] says to do which is exactly how I got
[02:05:11] this far in the first place he said now
[02:05:12] I'm stuck with the tea levels of an
[02:05:14] oversex 19yearold I'm not complaining
[02:05:17] damn but so this is the thing that um
[02:05:21] people realizing now there's some
[02:05:23] extreme benefit to
[02:05:26] heavyduty S here this extreme benefit to
[02:05:29] heavy duty cold exposure right and then
[02:05:32] you force your body to heat up and then
[02:05:34] you work
[02:05:38] out there so so you know I'm trying that
[02:05:41] now and I've only done it three days in
[02:05:42] a row well how's it working it's working
[02:05:45] it's hard but the the the but part of it
[02:05:48] is just the the fact that you have to do
[02:05:50] it in the like I'm not giving myself any
[02:05:52] mornings off so I have that's how I
[02:05:54] start my day now whereas before I was
[02:05:57] working out so the workout I ease myself
[02:05:59] into the workout get on the bike warm up
[02:06:01] jump a little rope start the kettle bell
[02:06:03] routine do all the things you got to do
[02:06:05] but now it's just right into the suck so
[02:06:08] it's it's harder I tell you right now
[02:06:09] man the [ __ ] cold being in cold water
[02:06:12] cold ice water it literally is the one
[02:06:15] thing that makes you question everything
[02:06:19] when you're going through hard training
[02:06:21] and [ __ ] like that
[02:06:22] you know I've been through a lot of
[02:06:23] different training the military and that
[02:06:25] cold water it definitely many dreams die

[02:06:54] level of cold I want to ease myself into

[02:06:58] worst that might be the best way to do
[02:07:00] it Jamie yeah that's what tell got jump
[02:07:03] in that I did I just I just couldn't go

[02:07:30] intense [ __ ] So speaking of that
[02:07:33] who's the best ever oh the best ever in
[02:07:37] MMA ever an MMA it's hard to say there's
[02:07:41] a lot of candidates you know I've always
[02:07:43] said Mighty Mouse is one of my Best Bets
[02:07:46] CU he was so goddamn good and he's still
[02:07:48] so godamn good now but now he's fighting
[02:07:50] in one FC but he was a flyweight
[02:07:52] Champion for a long time and his he was
[02:07:55] the highest level of expression of mixed
[02:07:58] martial arts ability that I'd ever seen
[02:08:00] but he's also fighting guys that are
[02:08:02] much lighter they're 125 pounds you know
[02:08:05] everyone's very quick but he was just so
[02:08:07] skillful but then there's Jon Jones Jon
[02:08:10] Jones really never lost that's a nasty
[02:08:13] [ __ ] he's a nasty [ __ ]
[02:08:14] and you know really Jon Jones [ __ ] off
[02:08:17] you want to talk about a guy who just
[02:08:19] did it by talent and will
[02:08:22] Jon Jones beat Alexander Guston without
[02:08:24] training unbeli basically didn't train
[02:08:26] there's a few guys like that there's a
[02:08:27] guy named Ryan span who's out there
[02:08:29] right now who just [ __ ] up Dominic
[02:08:31] Reyes and Dominic Reyes was the one guy
[02:08:33] who took Jon Jones to the Limit Dominic
[02:08:36] Reyes uh went on a series of losses
[02:08:38] after that fight but he had this fight
[02:08:41] with Jon Jones and took Jon Jones to the
[02:08:44] [ __ ] limit and a lot of people
[02:08:46] thought he won that decision then he
[02:08:48] went on after that fight got got knocked
[02:08:51] out by Yan bovich who became the light
[02:08:53] heavyweight champion got knocked out by
[02:08:55] Yuri prasa and then just got lit up by
[02:08:58] Ryan span and Ryan span is this guy
[02:09:00] who's always been Ultra Ultra talented
[02:09:04] right but just was always afraid of
[02:09:06] running out of gas didn't train didn't
[02:09:08] really put in camps just had a lot of
[02:09:10] ability and a lot of technique right in
[02:09:12] his last fight he fought Dominic Reyes
[02:09:15] and he put in a full training camp for
[02:09:17] the first time ever and just [ __ ]
[02:09:20] Dominic Reyes up just lit him up like a
[02:09:22] Christmas tree in the first round and
[02:09:23] put him away so you're talking about a
[02:09:24] guy who beat you know many people's eyes
[02:09:27] should have won a decision against John
[02:09:29] Jones right and then Ryan span just
[02:09:31] takes him out in the first round easy
[02:09:33] quick because he finally worked hard
[02:09:36] well there's something about that full
[02:09:37] training camp man yes there's something
[02:09:40] about going out no phone yes up in the
[02:09:43] [ __ ] mountains away from civilization
[02:09:46] away from the bacon and eggs the silk
[02:09:48] sheets the [ __ ] five star resorts the
[02:09:51] [ __ ] everybody knowing you sign
[02:09:52] autographs and [ __ ] Dark Matter dude
[02:09:55] Dark Matter like a [ __ ] the
[02:09:57] further you [ __ ] drive out your house
[02:10:00] and start going up in that [ __ ]
[02:10:01] Mountain Man you start
[02:10:03] to that [ __ ] mind starts to click
[02:10:06] over man you get a full Camp up in some
[02:10:08] [ __ ] Dark Matter Place yep it's
[02:10:10] [ __ ] over bro there's a reason why so
[02:10:11] many guys would go up to Big Bear that's
[02:10:14] where genady Golovkin used to go up
[02:10:15] there can't Brea in that mother Ali used
[02:10:17] to go to the Poconos Ali or um Tyson
[02:10:21] rather would go to the cat skills a lot
[02:10:23] of guys would do that lot of evil up in
[02:10:25] them [ __ ] mountains boring cat skills
[02:10:27] it's also this nature oh yeah cuz like
[02:10:29] nature doesn't give a [ __ ] about you and
[02:10:30] there's something you realize when
[02:10:32] you're running a mountain and you know
[02:10:34] you see Eagles Fly nobody gives a [ __ ]
[02:10:36] about you up there no one there's no
[02:10:37] press no one's watching that's a
[02:10:39] beautiful thing man that's when you
[02:10:40] really know who you are yeah when you
[02:10:42] get up there there's no like the coach
[02:10:44] is probably back a little bit you got

[02:13:39] when his father died he told his mother
[02:13:41] he was going to fight one more time and
[02:13:43] that's it so he's in his prime still
[02:13:45] right now he's in his physical prime and
[02:13:48] he's like told his mom he's GNA he's
[02:13:50] done he's not coming back you don't
[02:13:52] think well his Protege is Islam ma makev
[02:13:56] who's now the new UFC lightweight
[02:13:58] champion and Islam is as good as him in
[02:14:01] that same realm w i mean remains to be
[02:14:04] seen whether or not Islam can have a
[02:14:06] Reign the way he did but he just beat
[02:14:07] Charles Oliva was one of the best ever
[02:14:09] and he just ran through him to win the
[02:14:11] title that's a bad dude too man ol is a
[02:14:14] bad [ __ ] and olera is an
[02:14:16] interesting case too because Ola used to
[02:14:18] be kind of a quitter yeah I know he kind
[02:14:20] of fell apart in many fights early in
[02:14:22] his career and then he had the birth of
[02:14:24] his daughter and then changed his
[02:14:26] [ __ ] entire life changed the way he
[02:14:29] fought changed his mentality changed his
[02:14:32] his discipline and his focus and then
[02:14:34] became this [ __ ] who just
[02:14:37] dominating everybody olera I believe
[02:14:39] he's 33 see find out with if that's
[02:14:42] accurate so are there some are there
[02:14:44] some old Fighters right now who are
[02:14:45] still kicking
[02:14:46] ass yes yam bovich um Glover toer
[02:14:51] just lost the light heavyweight title at
[02:14:53] 42 he won it at 42 and then lost it to
[02:14:56] Yuri brovka in a very very close fight
[02:14:58] yeah he's 33 olera is 33 you know what's
[02:15:01] funny about that man but I see these
[02:15:02] older guys who are still [ __ ]
[02:15:03] grinding hard people ask about father
[02:15:06] time yeah father time doesn't get you
[02:15:09] man it's father
[02:15:11] fatigue it's father fatigue man like I
[02:15:13] see these guys who have been in sports
[02:15:15] for a long time fighting or basketball
[02:15:17] football whatever it is yeah and it's
[02:15:20] that grind
[02:15:22] it's that everyday waking up grind it's
[02:15:24] not it's it's not father time man it's
[02:15:26] it's the fact that you know I got to go
[02:15:27] do it again yeah I got to do it again so
[02:15:30] a lot of these guys are fighting father
[02:15:31] fatigue and they're doing a good job of
[02:15:32] doing it I think there's many factors
[02:15:34] there's father fatigue there's father
[02:15:36] enthusiasm that's right but then there's
[02:15:38] also injuries there's you so many of
[02:15:41] these guys are fighting with [ __ ] up
[02:15:43] backs and [ __ ] up knees and [ __ ] up
[02:15:45] elbows and [ __ ] up hands and you don't
[02:15:47] know that when you see them because they
[02:15:48] look jacked they look ripped right in
[02:15:51] their head they know I got to be careful
[02:15:54] if I move to the side on my right side
[02:15:56] cuz my knee's [ __ ] I know all about
[02:15:58] that I got to be careful if I get kicked
[02:15:59] in the legs because this is [ __ ] I got
[02:16:01] to be yeah and there's a lot of guys
[02:16:04] that also been they taking too many
[02:16:05] shots and they can't take a punch
[02:16:07] anymore right that happens to guys and
[02:16:09] then you see they get dinged once and
[02:16:11] they get wobbly where so what the [ __ ]
[02:16:14] happens with that man I started seeing
[02:16:16] guys who [ __ ] been getting hit a lot
[02:16:18] yeah they can't take a hit anymore man
[02:16:19] like they'll [ __ ] go out quick lot of
[02:16:21] speculation and um one of the things
[02:16:24] they say is that they believe that at
[02:16:26] certain point in time your brain tries
[02:16:27] to protect you from the punishment and
[02:16:30] just shut off like that your your your
[02:16:33] body realizes like this dude is too
[02:16:35] strong mentally he's too tough and he'll
[02:16:39] just absorb shots and is just ruining
[02:16:41] our brain so when you get hit your brain
[02:16:43] is like check please wow and your brain
[02:16:46] will shut off and then the other that's
[02:16:48] a optimistic perspective got it the
[02:16:51] other less optimistic perspective is
[02:16:53] that you are destroying your mind and
[02:16:56] that your mind is simply not resilient
[02:16:57] anymore and you can't take a shot
[02:16:59] anymore because you've damaged all the
[02:17:01] connective tissue that's holding the
[02:17:02] [ __ ] brain in place and you've also
[02:17:04] created so much CTE and so much swelling
[02:17:08] and so that one shot can take you out
[02:17:10] there's also on top of that one of the
[02:17:12] big problems with MMA is the weight
[02:17:14] cutting so the weight cutting is which
[02:17:16] what everybody does they they drain
[02:17:19] themselves 24 hours before the fight
[02:17:20] when in say oh he weighs 170 lbs like
[02:17:23] guys like kamaro Usman who's giant for
[02:17:26] 170 he's 170 for like 20 minutes how
[02:17:29] much does he weigh like walking the
[02:17:31] street 200 lb 200 lb easy so does he
[02:17:33] come back in the ring about 190 200 he's
[02:17:36] in the90s for sure yeah lean as [ __ ]
[02:17:39] shredded is a [ __ ] but
[02:17:41] dehydrated like hell to make 170 there's
[02:17:44] he's not ever really 170 wow he's 170 be
[02:17:49] like totally sucked up I mean also
[02:17:53] cramping you know it's terrible to do
[02:17:56] that 24 hours before you have a cage
[02:17:58] fight is so crazy [ __ ] up so those
[02:18:01] take a toll so if you're 35 37 39 all
[02:18:06] these guys that have been doing that
[02:18:09] their whole life every time you cut that
[02:18:12] weight it takes a little chip off the
[02:18:14] old block every time every time it takes
[02:18:17] it's another chop into the tree trunk
[02:18:19] got it just your foundation and it's
[02:18:22] just little minor things every training
[02:18:24] camp you go through you know can you do
[02:18:27] another one you know your back is [ __ ]
[02:18:29] up you get out of bed like this
[02:18:32] like it's like little micro injuries
[02:18:35] that are constantly piling up you know
[02:18:37] we were talking about hickon Gracie
[02:18:38] earlier Hixon can can't really even roll
[02:18:41] hard anymore he's in the 60s and he's
[02:18:43] got these injuries all over his back is
[02:18:46] all [ __ ] up it's like all those years
[02:18:48] of Jiu-Jitsu that Gracie shit's no joke
[02:18:50] though M them [ __ ] that family
[02:18:52] they change the world the world this
[02:18:55] little 160 lb [ __ ] man this
[02:18:58] little [ __ ] can't even see him
[02:19:00] under some of these fat [ __ ]
[02:19:01] this [ __ ] finger finger [ __ ]
[02:19:03] locking you out man [ __ ] get you
[02:19:05] in a pinky lock bro like where is he
[02:19:08] tapping from why is he tapping I can't
[02:19:10] even see you know Gracie got
[02:19:11] [ __ ] a pinky
[02:19:14] loot this [ __ ] was nasty dude T they
[02:19:16] taught the world Jiu-Jitsu the world
[02:19:18] didn't know Jiu-Jitsu is the only
[02:19:20] martial art that people had ever
[02:19:23] experienced that did what was advertised
[02:19:26] right what was advertised was that a
[02:19:27] small skillful person could beat a
[02:19:30] larger stronger opponent who didn't know
[02:19:32] the techniques well he proved it he
[02:19:34] proved it boy Gracie proved it in the
[02:19:36] UFC and he changed martial arts forever
[02:19:38] and that that family's probably the most
[02:19:41] consequential the most important
[02:19:43] significant family in the history of
[02:19:45] martial arts the Gracie family changed
[02:19:47] martial arts worldwide it's funny man
[02:19:50] about you know there's so many people
[02:19:51] out here who uh who are very successful
[02:19:54] and they talk about I mean Super money
[02:19:57] great familyship they talk about that
[02:19:58] that they're missing something that
[02:20:00] there's something in their life that
[02:20:01] they're missing and they and they talk
[02:20:05] to me about that [ __ ] and I mentioned
[02:20:06] the Gracies it seemed like they they had
[02:20:09] this it was about money it was about
[02:20:13] nothing man they're like Grassroots
[02:20:15] [ __ ] and that's what I always
[02:20:17] tell people that they're missing that
[02:20:19] they're missing that desire
[02:20:21] like those guys had a passion and a
[02:20:23] [ __ ] obsess that's the word Obsession
[02:20:26] Obsession and I guarantee you man those
[02:20:28] [ __ ] don't have those
[02:20:29] conversations I feel like I'm missing
[02:20:31] something right they're not they're not
[02:20:33] missing [ __ ] dude no no they they they
[02:20:36] got it figured out man well Hixon in
[02:20:38] particular cuz Hixon was Ho's older
[02:20:40] brother who was everybody says is the
[02:20:43] greatest of all time really from that
[02:20:45] era yeah he was there was never been a
[02:20:48] time other than today there's a time
[02:20:50] right now with Gordon Ryan which is very
[02:20:52] rare it's very rare where someone comes
[02:20:54] along and everybody says this is the
[02:20:58] baddest [ __ ] alive no if ANS or
[02:21:00] questions about and back then when Hixon
[02:21:02] was in his prime you ask any black belt
[02:21:05] anywhere in the world they're like
[02:21:07] hixon's the man hixon's the man and he
[02:21:10] was a yogi he all this crazy breath work
[02:21:14] that he would do he figured out the
[02:21:15] physical as well as the mental far
[02:21:18] beyond where everybody else was willing
[02:21:20] to track travel and there's a great
[02:21:22] documentary people are interested in
[02:21:23] Hickson Gracie called choke hixon's been
[02:21:25] on the podcast a couple of times but
[02:21:27] there's a great documentary called choke
[02:21:29] that followed him when he was in his
[02:21:31] prime in the 1990s competing in Japan
[02:21:34] and uh one of the things he does in that
[02:21:36] documentary he gets in a frozen glacial
[02:21:38] River and he just sits down and he's
[02:21:40] meditating In this River up to his neck
[02:21:42] of this [ __ ] 30 Dee water just
[02:21:44] washing over him and he's just be Talent
[02:21:46] bro he's like thank you my Lord thank
[02:21:48] you my Lord and he's just like just
[02:21:50] taking it all in it's beyond Talent
[02:21:52] that's badass there there's so much
[02:21:54] involved there's Talent there's
[02:21:56] discipline there's the Mind focus and
[02:21:59] there's also the Brilliance of his
[02:22:02] ability to interpret and understand
[02:22:05] technique right there was so many things
[02:22:07] that's badass and this is the the case
[02:22:09] with Gordon Ryan today who's arguably
[02:22:12] the greatest of all time and Gordon is a
[02:22:15] lot bigger than everybody that was you
[02:22:16] know like Hixon was at his prime was
[02:22:19] about 200 lbs Gordon's like 240 and you
[02:22:22] know Gordon is utilizing modern training
[02:22:24] methods and 365 days a year he trains
[02:22:28] doesn't take any days off this is Hixon
[02:22:30] in the the Frozen glacial
[02:22:33] River that's his brother hoer who's also
[02:22:35] one of the greats that that's that
[02:22:37] Gracie family man never been a family
[02:22:40] like never been a family like it in
[02:22:42] martial arts you just have like never
[02:22:43] will be Army of killers that's it yeah I
[02:22:46] mean look at him snorkel yep that's what
[02:22:49] he likes to do is to get under that
[02:22:51] water and he does that with a cold
[02:22:52] plunge too know what's what's crazy that
[02:22:55] so many people would never understand
[02:22:57] that kind of discipline or that kind
[02:22:59] of that kind of human being that wants
[02:23:02] to go to the stratosphere yeah they'll
[02:23:05] never they'll always be misunderstood
[02:23:07] man always you can't even that's why a
[02:23:10] lot of times when I talk to people I
[02:23:11] can't I can't have a conversation with a
[02:23:13] lot of people man because you're going
[02:23:15] to walk away like why do you do it David
[02:23:19] why don't you just take a break you
[02:23:20] deserve a break David take a nap that's
[02:23:23] it did you ever have a piece of
[02:23:27] pie why don't you put your feet up why

[02:23:32] get fat that's it you should let
[02:23:33] yourself get fat dude you're being funny
[02:23:36] as [ __ ] B the truest of all [ __ ]
[02:23:38] statements oh yeah dude I don't do
[02:23:40] nearly as much as you and I get it dude
[02:23:42] right I'm like you you would never
[02:23:46] understand that's why we'll never talk
[02:23:48] yeah you'll never get it so that's why I
[02:23:50] don't have conversations with people man
[02:23:51] those are brutal conversations with
[02:23:52] people that like what I don't understand
[02:23:54] what your motivation is what what are
[02:23:56] you chasing I haven't been on a podcast
[02:23:58] years you insecure where you running
[02:24:00] from where you running from David where
[02:24:03] you going you know you get there faster
[02:24:06] in a car in the car oh I get that a lot
[02:24:08] that's the one I get a lot I get that a
[02:24:10] lot and and they're joking I'm like and
[02:24:14] I don't find this [ __ ] funny like you
[02:24:15] [ __ ] man it's so dumb it's dumb
[02:24:18] as [ __ ] man but whenever you some
[02:24:20] someone who's that wild and that far
[02:24:24] beyond where most people are willing to
[02:24:26] go you're going to you're going to run
[02:24:27] into normies well it's like
[02:24:29] [ __ ] go into the circle breaker
[02:24:31] man and they go in there and start
[02:24:32] rewiring their brain they go in and say
[02:24:34] like like like that [ __ ] right
[02:24:36] there with the snorkel and [ __ ] yeah oh
[02:24:38] no man I got to put this over here yeah
[02:24:41] this circuit needs to be there that
[02:24:42] needs to be there you're totally
[02:24:43] rewiring how the whole brain works to
[02:24:45] not to not feel sorry for yourself to
[02:24:48] ignore pain to ignore discomfort to push
[02:24:50] your place you know to push your mind
[02:24:52] place that people don't even [ __ ]
[02:24:53] want to talk about they can't fathom and
[02:24:55] it's what you talk about with knowledge
[02:24:57] yep that's what it is this knowledge
[02:24:59] it's understanding of those feelings
[02:25:01] that's it and the only way you
[02:25:03] understand that those feelings are rare
[02:25:04] they don't come up all the time all day
[02:25:06] long you wouldn't be able to deal with
[02:25:08] them right so most people don't know
[02:25:10] what to do with those feelings they're
[02:25:11] not around them enough but you're around
[02:25:13] them constantly right Hixon was around
[02:25:15] them constantly it's like get in those
[02:25:17] things then you learn about them you get
[02:25:19] a map of the territory that's it you get
[02:25:21] a blueprint yeah and the second day
[02:25:23] surface when you're [ __ ] getting
[02:25:24] choked out I've seen so many see I love
[02:25:27] watching fights man cuz I I see them and
[02:25:31] I start to see okay you're in a bad
[02:25:32] situation man and I see a couple guys
[02:25:34] getting ready to [ __ ] tap yeah and
[02:25:36] that one second decision I call it
[02:25:38] they're thinking man I got to tap it's
[02:25:40] like and and and and and you see the
[02:25:42] hand motion like I'm about to tap and it
[02:25:44] go somewhere else not today [ __ ]
[02:25:46] yeah cuz I've been here I've been here
[02:25:49] before I can laugh maybe this one more
[02:25:51] second and this one second may get me
[02:25:54] out of this [ __ ] and I see how the how
[02:25:56] the mind is evolving in that one moment
[02:25:59] that one quick moment I see that a
[02:26:01] million thoughts went through their
[02:26:02] [ __ ] mind and it didn't tap I'm going
[02:26:05] show you an example of that Brian Ortega
[02:26:08] versus Alexander volkanovski Alexander

[02:26:25] he's going up to 155 to try to fight
[02:26:28] makev and win the title at that weight
[02:26:30] so he fights this guy Brian Ortega who

[02:27:54] moment if he could even think about it
[02:27:56] the knowledge he gained in that moment
[02:27:58] Priceless where what was happening when
[02:28:00] you almost tapped what was and I'm not
[02:28:03] talking about this surface conversation
[02:28:05] that's beautiful to me that I I study
[02:28:07] that [ __ ] so much you were in a horrible
[02:28:10] situation I know you were like I gotta
[02:28:12] tap I got to tap I gotta tap but if you
[02:28:14] break that down really break it down to
[02:28:17] the smallest molecule possible your mind
[02:28:19] went through so so many things that
[02:28:21] allowed you to not tap you got to study
[02:28:24] that man that right there is so much
[02:28:26] that's that's beautiful yeah that's that
[02:28:28] that's Beauty right there at work Beauty

[02:28:42] he almost didn't I see he got to the
[02:28:45] door of death see it's that one second
[02:28:47] decision that one second decision I talk
[02:28:49] about this [ __ ] right here you
[02:28:52] get there and you want to quit and you
[02:28:54] don't yeah and you end up [ __ ]
[02:28:56] getting through it man well that's the
[02:28:58] thing is like your book can give people
[02:29:02] if even if they don't get a map of the
[02:29:03] territory they're getting directions
[02:29:06] right you want to go to I95 go about 10
[02:29:08] miles down when you see Woodland Hills
[02:29:11] Road take a right you're giving them
[02:29:13] you're mind not be giving them a map cuz
[02:29:15] I think the map has to be acquired
[02:29:17] personally 100% well you're giving them
[02:29:20] Direction that's it you're saying this
[02:29:22] is how I got through this is how I
[02:29:24] developed my map MH people want to hand
[02:29:27] it to me I can't hand it to you you
[02:29:28] can't but you can give them something
[02:29:30] and I when I texted you I was in the
[02:29:32] middle of the book I was like I can run
[02:29:34] through a [ __ ] wall right now cuz
[02:29:36] that's what it feels like I love that
[02:29:38] there's something about the way you
[02:29:40] describe things and the way you're so
[02:29:42] honest and so personal about
[02:29:44] it especially the audio version of it
[02:29:47] and then when you do the podcast so the
[02:29:49] way the audio the audio is a special
[02:29:51] treat because it's the book and then
[02:29:54] with each individual chapter you have a
[02:29:56] small podcast where you and your
[02:29:59] co-writer break down what what what it
[02:30:02] was like for you and what was happening
[02:30:05] and and what what you were feeling and
[02:30:07] what you and it allows you to do it in
[02:30:09] an unscripted way so you could really
[02:30:11] and you're so honest about it it just it
[02:30:15] just gives you an understanding of that
[02:30:18] you this discomfort is UN avoidable
[02:30:20] right and then trying to avoid
[02:30:22] discomfort just brings you more
[02:30:23] discomfort and you don't realize it it
[02:30:25] just brings you this longterm dull
[02:30:28] discomfort as opposed to the Searing
[02:30:30] pain of like mid struggle discomfort
[02:30:34] which is what everybody's trying to
[02:30:35] avoid but you're still going to get
[02:30:37] discomfort you're just going to get this
[02:30:39] I could have should have would have been
[02:30:41] discomfort which is maybe worse you're
[02:30:44] right it might be worse it just makes it
[02:30:46] a little easier that's all that's all
[02:30:48] the repetitions do man it's not it
[02:30:50] doesn't take away the pain doesn't take
[02:30:52] away the suffering no you just studied
[02:30:54] it you know it you know how it feels
[02:30:56] yeah you know when to breathe when not
[02:30:58] to breathe you know all these different
[02:31:00] things you've been there you visited
[02:31:02] you've you you've lived there for a long
[02:31:04] period of time and that's why I like
[02:31:06] this book so much is because can't hurt
[02:31:08] me was like a bachelor's degree it was
[02:31:11] like the surface level of David gogins
[02:31:13] and some things that can help you out
[02:31:16] this to me is a master's degree this
[02:31:18] book right here takes you to another
[02:31:19] level of of the mind and how you think
[02:31:22] that's why I say this ain't no [ __ ]

[02:33:21] no this is the beautiful thing of your
[02:33:23] story is that you started out [ __ ] up
[02:33:26] and sad and couldn't do anything and you
[02:33:30] transformed yourself so people don't
[02:33:33] think like this guy's just always been
[02:33:34] hard from the cradle to bra like you you
[02:33:38] you turned yourself into this which is
[02:33:40] the real that's the that's the story
[02:33:42] that gives people hope you can truly
[02:33:45] develop otherworldly discipline right
[02:33:47] it's possible to develop other worldly
[02:33:49] mental strength well we change
[02:33:51] everything we change our car we change
[02:33:53] our house sometimes we change our wife
[02:33:55] or husband we change the underwear we
[02:33:57] change everything in our lives change
[02:33:59] our hair change how we look change
[02:34:02] everything but very few of us change how
[02:34:04] we think and that's the one problem with

## Plain Text (for processing)

Joe Rogan podcast check it out The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day Joe Rogan podcast by night all day you do a podcast like every [ __ ] day man pretty much this week every day [ __ ] that but I was just on vacation how was vacation nice little vacations are hard you know because like even though I enjoy rest I always feel like I shouldn't be always I get it you go on vacations no never no nope for me creatively it's good it's good to get a reset cuz I come back in guns blazing like I really I don't I don't risk any mental burnout when I do it well I have resets but my resets are like um I call them Aid stations mental Aid stations so when you're going [ __ ] hard and you're grind all the [ __ ] time like everybody knows you're 24 hours in the day but I'm in the shower it's a mental aid station I don't think about [ __ ] I don't [ __ ] think about people I don't think about work I don't think about running I don't think about working out I'm in the car another [ __ ] mental aid station when I'm [ __ ] eating mental aid station so people EA and they work and all sort [ __ ] man so I I can grind hard because a lot of times I'm in mental [ __ ] a stations chilling so you have little mini vacations mini vacations man all day long all day long do you feel now almost a responsibility to like stay at it all the time cuz so many people are watching and paying attention and drawing inspiration from you 100% I mean like I probably would have retired a long time ago but I get these emails from people and it's like they're living through me like their strength comes through what they know I'm doing so there's so many times I want to get up and say oh man [ __ ] it I got mine I'm good and I'm like [ __ ] [ __ ] Tommy out there [ __ ] [ __ ] Tommy talking about tomm in his email Tommy talking about [ __ ] saved his life man I ran 10 miles last night because of you man I'm like you know a lot of people can live off of that and they can [ __ ] be good with that and you know a lot of motivational people come out here man and run their [ __ ] mouths about [ __ ] and I know they are not doing [ __ ] they sit back and they're [ __ ] like you know they have their little brainstorming sessions about oh what should we say what's going what's going to connect with people while they're sing their [ __ ] ass my brainstorming sessions is [ __ ] out there in the [ __ ] grip of life [ __ ] grinding and that's where the all my material comes from the suck every bit of it comes from the suck and that's the difference between there's a there's like a whole industry now that's dedicated to trying to help people get motivated and a lot of the people that are involved in that are very unqualified 100% cuz they're not really doing anything no there's so many people that haven't actually done anything but they'll try to teach you how to get your life in order and how to get your mind right and develop that Warrior mentality i'm like [ __ ] you don't have that well they're utilizing the weakness of the world right now yeah the world's in a very bad place so the PE these these people who are like K artists they sit back and say oh I can come up with this I can come up with this and this right here probably make me some money yeah so they're in it for for for [ __ ] up reasons this just not a whole lot of people like you you you know I love that phrase uncommon amongst uncommon men cuz it's it's such a good phrase because it just shows you you you've been on this path for so long and you're grinding for so long but you're also honest about there's moments where you don't want to [ __ ] do this oh which is why it's so interesting because you do it right you you do it without any reservation you just go through it right but you always talk about I don't want to [ __ ] do this [ __ ] but you always do it but that's what people need to hear because they feel like that somewhere out there there's some superhuman person who never feels Despair and doesn't have any there's there's no no hesitation so they feel like there's this person that's so different than them and so much stronger than them and doesn't ever have any procrastination and you're like that's not me no I love that phrase you told me once he goes sometimes I look at my [ __ ] shoes for half an hour AP put those [ __ ] on it's a true statement but but what I do though man is I I came with this thing called perform without purpose and so many people they need to have a 5k a 10K I need to have a a a course in front of me I need to have something in front of me for me get my [ __ ] ass up and do some [ __ ] and that used to be me and nowadays you know [ __ ] for past 20 some years I don't need [ __ ] purpose and people miss out on this man the purpose we're all looking for this golden purpose is it this is it that is it making money it is is it my family [ __ ] the purpose is you we forget that every [ __ ] day I wake up and I don't want to do some [ __ ] [ __ ] I'm like okay man do you want to be a [ __ ] today do you want to feel like a little [ __ ] do you want to walk around all day knowing that you could but you didn't so I I it's performed without purpose you you have to learn how to get up and do [ __ ] when you ain't got no [ __ ] 5K no 10K nothing nothing exists your life [ __ ] sucks you're in the [ __ ] dungeon but guess what [ __ ] I'm still going to get it because when that time comes cu the time is going to come when that purpose is there you'll be ready but most of us [ __ ] aren't ready because we don't know how to do without having the golden carrot in front of us yeah and so you're all [ __ ] there's also this thing where if you do it once it's over you get a break oh like that's what a 10K is that's what a marathon is I'm going to train for this marathon and you're you're training and you're training for that big day but you're also recognizing when that marathon's over that's right that's right and as you get better at that H moment the all moment becomes less and less so my all moments now are like oh I ran today I went to the gym today I did this and this today I studied today I have about eight hours off in those eight hours are glorious to me and every day you go back out and you start earning that and every day you wake up it sucks and when it's over you feel better it sucks you feel better and as you get going as every step you take in that Journey as you're like for me run I run every day [ __ ] hate it but every step I take I'm like all right [ __ ] you're beating the demon again you run every day but I don't think people understand how [ __ ] up your knees are no you you you run when you sent me that x-ray after your surgery and I looked at what they did to your knee and and I looked at what it looks like right what the actual bone on bone looks like and how it had distorted because there's no cushioning at all no and the doctor said to you I can't even believe you could [ __ ] walk on these knees yeah forget about run thousands of miles so you're doing this every day in constant pain right right what is it like well I don't suggest explain your knees first of all so okay so PE people think that my knees are bad from a lot of running and they're wrong I'm I wasn't born healthy I wasn't born with some great body alignment some great you know I have sickle cell I have all kind of [ __ ] I have all kind of health issues you know all kind of I'm I'm [ __ ] up so I had a choice to make and the choice was you know growing up you know okay this hurts that hurts we can just sit down and do nothing or we can see how far we can push the human body so on that Journey as I started getting more and more into my mind and start realizing that while what I'm capable of doing my mind got stronger so the so the pain in my knees while it sucked I've been doing it for so long it was like it became my new Norm like okay my knees hurt [ __ ] it stop you know and I and I call like um stop feeling sorry for yourself but you sometimes have to ignore your feelings I'm Ming Jamie a picture you KNE oh no do I I I think Jamie has some uh do you have a picture of his KNE Jamie did I ever show send it to you Jamie I have it here hold on let me just but keep going no so it's like for for me I I made decision and my decision was to be the best person I could and I basically a lot of mornings I wake up and say [ __ ] your feelings and that doesn't mean like you know don't take it literally [ __ ] your feelings but sometimes you have to go beyond what you're feeling and my knees were [ __ ] but guess what I wanted to run and I knew that okay you can get knee Replacements this and that like I said it wasn't because of I Ran too much people always want to say oh man you ran so much so you [ __ ] up your body you know you don't want to be like David Goggins I hear all the time you w't be like David Goggins but so there's your name yeah there it is look look at the fact that there's zero space between those bones yes sir from the top from your your your tibia to your femur there's zero space it's just kneecap covering two bones that are rubbing against each other and so this was after surgery where they had to cut your knee slice your shin like in half and then take a chunk out of it because it had deformed so much from you running with bone on bone that it was starting to like swell out in One Direction and it was changing the alignment of your leg right this happened back in 2000 2001 I was going through buds so this happened for a long this is this right here has been going on for a long time so and it got to a point where it's like okay I'm done and that's the pl that's in there right now so as you see the wedge that part right there in the bone that's opened up yeah so they had to cut it realign it and then um now the uh alignment is better but this is now about 17 months ago 17 18 months ago when this happened so couldn't I get some screws that fit go back to that real quick real the one sticks right out of the [ __ ] bone hey cut that [ __ ] off yeah that [ __ ] down is that thing sticking into your leg no I don't well I feel the plate every single time I move yeah so every time so because it's like connected to the hamstring so whenever I [ __ ] whenever I move that plate is very irritating so every step even like when I walk when I run it's just it's a very irritating thing and then you got to wait for so long for that leg to start getting back into place and if you see that other picture I sent of the foam my my foam leg that I put my hand in I think Jennifer sent it to you Jamie with the foam leg you'll see this in a second this is [ __ ] up so like the swelling in that leg was [ __ ] nuts oh when you had EMA yeah you showed it to me in Vegas you you were sticking your thumb into your sh I grabbed it yeah yeah so it was it was pretty nuts but um you know once again it's just things you uh things I was willing to endure to get it right there so that's just all post surgery swelling yeah so when the doctor said this to you and he he said look this is how [ __ ] up your knee is did he say you need a replacement what what was he saying basically I had two options so I went to the first guy had the surgery done that's in the book I talked about that but then the second guy so after the first surgery I was done so this is the first surgery after buds no so this is like back in uh looking at 2000 so me and Cameron this is recently so I didn't have any surgery going through buds really I didn't have any surgery at all so I went through in 2001 I [ __ ] up 20 2001 whatever it was I messed up my leg real bad and hell we kept on going on it just kept on going kept what did you do to it in how week it was like I I [ __ ] it up somehow like running or whatever I Happ it it can't hurt me but um it was uh I think the boat I fell it twisted but over a period of time it's got worse and worse and worse so I was getting like Tor all shots every day and then just got worse but I'm like [ __ ] it I'm good so I kept going on it so it kind of healed all [ __ ] up so this kept going kept going kept going years later years later just kept going on it so I stopped squatting so it became like okay my knee's [ __ ] up my align is messed up my hips are messed up I can't squat so but I still run it's okay I started running cuz running doesn't require you to bend down and [ __ ] so I'm running a lot and it got to um 20 years later pretty much and it was 2020 or i g get this right camon Haynes came down we went for a 20 mile run my knees were [ __ ] up for like 10 years long story short it was like okay man I got to get this thing looked at so when got looked at the doc was like oh we can go in there and just do a quick little [ __ ] you know cleanup job and the cleanup job went so quick guy was breaking tools and [ __ ] [ __ ] up like literally broke tools and I have it in there he he was breaking tools I talked to him I know he told me your meniscus was the hardest meniscus he's ever experienced in his life he's like dude he goes I didn't know that miniscus could get that way he goes like he's not human he goes when I was cutting into meniscus it broke the scalpel yep Wolf's lost and Joie said Wolf's lost something yeah yeah he said normally when you cut in meniscus it just slices right through like butter he's like I couldn't cut it yeah might went butter I went butter so all those [ __ ] who think I went putting them 100 while weeks go [ __ ] yourself [ __ ] you don't get no [ __ ] like that baby i s on the [ __ ] couch no I mean that's the craziest thing I've ever heard like you've hardened your meniscus just through constant pressure and pounding yeah so he went in there to clean it up and then what happened so basically that little meniscus that whatever the [ __ ] was in there so my so my alignment was so bad the only thing that was keeping me able to do anything was that little [ __ ] up messed up um meniscus it was all Jarred up and jacked up but the second that thing got out dude it was like I was have you seen Star Wars those those storm thing those those those those big [ __ ] um things that what they called um they have wobbly legs when they hit like logs robot things yeah robot things that's how my leg was it was it had nothing it was just like a little dangling [ __ ] like so from my knee down the shin the tip FIB it just dangled like there was nothing and I was like okay man this so was worse after the cleanup much worse like I was done I went from running 200 M to I I did 240 mile race in in 20120 October 2020 it was Moab went out there got second place 6 2 hours knee was [ __ ] up getting it drained before the [ __ ] race but I still ran 240 miles literally 5 or 6 days before the race I'm getting it drained and it was a baseball siiz [ __ ] um it's called a baker's assist so they drained it and I went in there did the race finished it and I was like okay here we go went on to do some more races I did like another 200 mile did a couple more races and then like I said cam came down but after that I went and got this surgery done and I went from running every day to now I have some [ __ ] leg that just dangles and after that surgery it just [ __ ] dangled I was like okay man I'm [ __ ] and just from that little piece of manessa just that little piece of meniscus and I'm sitting there thinking okay man this is not this doesn't make any sense to me this there's something [ __ ] I don't understand why I can't I can't put any pressure on my leg the the amount of blood they were taking out was was unbelievable so there's the blood right there Jesus Christ that's the blood dude oh my god there one two three four five you see the black blood yeah that is deoxygenated blood so whatever was going on whatever the [ __ ] was going on that's why it looks different color so the red blood is the the blood that has oxygen right and that was just like coagulated [ __ ] up blood yep Jesus yeah so that so after surgery I'm like I'm like seven seven days out or whatever the [ __ ] it was and once again I don't know the exact times but I have them in the book I have everything [ __ ] dialed in um I went back I was like man I'm I'm [ __ ] up I mean it's a simple miniscus surgery man like people go back a week later they're playing two weeks three weeks tops I'm like man I'm never going to [ __ ] run again I'm G to walk with the [ __ ] limp so I'm going back I'm getting [ __ ] like um literally getting my knee drained every week getting PRP I'm like man but in the back of my mind I I know how far I can push myself I know my body so [ __ ] well so well and I'm like this is um this is wrong I go I'm never gonna run again I'm never going to run again I walk with the limp so this went on for about six six months so I had the surgery done in February it was uh February March April May June about four months four months after surgery four or five months I'm like hey Jennifer um I gotta find another you know somebody else look at my [ __ ] knee so I try to keep my [ __ ] together but imagine when you go from every day of your [ __ ] life grinding and you go to nothing mhm like literally like 90minut surgery done that's crazy that it was just a little meniscus scope 90 minute surgery done and I was like okay man this is anyway so I found this guy named Dr Gamal out of New York and we fly there but I'm like he can't fix this man because I knew it was a lot more than knes it was just it was all kind of this [ __ ] up body [ __ ] and I walk in the office and he decides to see me and me and Jennifer in there Jennifer's happy she's happy as [ __ ] it's like oh my God man this guy's going to be able to get you a a [ __ ] miniscus replacement he he was all kind of Guru out but I'm a realist bro I will push myself and I will go as far as I can but I also am a realist I also knew in the back of my mind I'm not gonna try to ruin your [ __ ] party Jennifer this what I'm saying myself but this shit's done it's over so but I went just to pretty much appease her and just see you know if there anything left so walk in the office and the doctor's like uh yeah I'm looking at your X-rays and that's the Doctor Who's like I don't know how this is one the Dr Gamal look him up world renowned [ __ ] dude and when this guy looked at me straight-faced he said man I don't know how you did anything with those knes anything let alone run 200 miles back to back 240 miles what the [ __ ] you did I don't know how you did it and so I'm like okay whatever can we get it fixed and he didn't want to get get there cuz he knew I was [ __ ] he's like no you know we we can maybe you know try an in un loader brace maybe an un loader brace will help you out and I was like what's an unloaded brace so basically my knee went in on the miniscus side on the inside so it was like jamming in the inside so this brace kind of like it kind of helps realign the knee a little bit so then you cannot have so much pressure on the inside of your leg so that's it right there one side yeah so basically I'm like man I'm like okay I'm not so this is all you have for me I'm like you can't do [ __ ] for me and he was like um no and he was walking out of the office and he could tell I was like I wasn't too [ __ ] up but I was like CU I kind of was preparing myself for the next part of my journey I don't like to lay in my [ __ ] too long you I give myself a couple minutes okay [ __ ] we gota man the [ __ ] up we gotta get back in this [ __ ] like what's next you know let's go let's go see you know let's let's go back to college let's let's do something because you're you're running and you're let Chris done so he got to the door he opened it and as he was literally he was shouldered out the [ __ ] door and I'm looking at Jennifer I'm like well you know we'll go back to [ __ ] you know go back to Nevada and [ __ ] start again and he was like try the unloaded brace out and there's one more thing we could possibly do for you and I'm like [ __ ] like get your little monkey [ __ ] ass back in here bro like what is is it like like like what the [ __ ] going on so he was like yeah there's this surgery called HTO and he was like you can go in we can [ __ ] you know pretty much break your tibia it's called high tibia osteotomy they go in and they break your tibia they they they like slice into it and they they wedge it to the point where they realign your leg back up it's a very painful surgery it's very painful afterwards painful as [ __ ] afterwards and they put that plate the plate you saw back on and then your leg is so so your knee is still where it was because this doesn't get fixed so it takes several months for that knee to start working it way back into where that alignment is so now my leg is just now so here it is you see it on the image yeah so they they take a slice out of it because it's deformed yep and that slice lowers the part that's deformed and tries to make it a more natural shape but you're still dealing with bone on bone so you're still deal you're still dealing with the pain of arthritis essentially cuz do you have any cartilage in your knees not much not much at all if any so the thing about it it takes that pressure off of that so it was complete bone on bone right what that surgery does is it takes it over to the lateral side so on the outside so I I have a nice meniscus over there that thing wasn't touched for years because how I was born all the pressure was on the uh my um medal meniscus so your knee had been misaligned your whole life whole life that's what yeah that's my whole life has been [ __ ] up so my Meniscus on my lateral side is pristine so now the way he did it is that all of my pressure is going on to that pristine miniscus okay so now it's all about getting that leg back aligned which is taken forever and it's still not aligned it's getting there it's getting there yeah it's getting there cuz M was so [ __ ] up can they do a meniscus replacement on you no so that's what I wanted to get done but if your knee is so far gone like mine was there was no option for that why is that because my knee was so far gone so it would like when you put that meniscus in there however it works he said it wouldn't have taken it like basically it would have taken it but it would have [ __ ] destroyed it because your leg is so your knee is so [ __ ] up so this was the only option for me don't they make like an artificial meniscus now as well yep and this with this guy really is specializes in so he's he's like the guy to go to for that stuff what is an artificial meniscus consist of I guess it's just I have no idea I'm not even going to get into that [ __ ] see if we can find out what that is cu I got some [ __ ] up knees too not like yours though if I ever think about complaining I look at yours yes sir see world's first artificial meniscus available in Israel and there you go Andreas gal yeah there he is and so this it looks like some sort of a clear gel looking stuff and which is you know the the meniscus is just a cushioning in between the two bones and the cartilage and this is uh oh look at that yep H and but they can't do that to you no you have to be a good candidate for that so your knee has to be in a certain certain condition and mine was not in that condition it was it was F if if you were candidate for that would they be able to do it and you be able to run or is that just like to move around and walk from what I read about you can you can run you can do everything you want to do but sometimes if you do a lot it wears it out so you but you could get a new one get a new one yeah that's not that bad not that bad man for you it doesn't work no because basically it wouldn't even work for me because my knee was gone but the way he reshaped it wouldn't that correct I mean he kind of like changed your alignment of your knee and made it more normal I think it had he made it more normal but from what I understand um if you put that in there structurally like like structure-wise what what makes it more normal is the surgery he did so right now there's no bone on bone for me so there's no need for that meniscus at all so a lot of people get their meniscus taken out if you have the right alignment and your body can do what it's supposed to do really yeah but if you get your KNE your miniscus taken out you're just cartilage on cartilage if you know um Dwayne Wade Dwayne basketball player yeah I believe Dwayne Wade played years years if I'm correct with no meniscus yeah I I think in both his knees Jesus yeah years he had he end up having like really bad knee problems but his meniscus was messed up back in the day they used to take it out so if you look here here it is was in college wow surgery to remove the meniscus in his left knee 11 years ago while he was at Marquette led to ongoing knee problems he's had with Miami Heat I'm so glad that you have this [ __ ] thing to pull up Jamie because I would be talking out my ass half the damn time that's I do man you [ __ ] [ __ ] squar me away brother knees are a problem man yeah and the fact that you require your knees to do what you do like your your whole thing is endurance athlete right and to be an endurance athlete you got to be able to move your legs you got to be able to move them but what I like about and this was this was like literally a a trained skill for me was I'm I'm always preparing for like not being a [ __ ] like a lot of people get to a point like for instance like if Jennifer can't do something like if you know if if if she can't go for a run or whatever just like cuz she something's wrong like some simple [ __ ] it's G to bother her I got to a point in my life where I realize this is life and so I move on past things real quick so people like oh my God what are you gonna do David if you can't run [ __ ] I'll swim or I'll go to college or I'll do something else this like like this isn't my life so I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm very aware how quick life can take [ __ ] from you and I've always prepared my mind for the next chapter and what happened with me was I started this thing called front loading so when I was young I used to be a little piece of [ __ ] you know like [ __ ] oh I'm not good enough I can't do this I can't do that but the second I got my head out of my ass and I realized man you can achieve a lot of [ __ ] if you get off your ass and you start moving and you start motivating yourself start becoming a self motivator so I started front loading and front loing is people man you've done so much by 47 because I don't know what tomorrow is going to bring me so my my military resume is fat you know I [ __ ] did a lot in the military I did a lot outside the military I've I've I've made money I've I've I've done almost every race out there hard race in the world I've broken pull-up records I've done a lot of [ __ ] so when these bad times come and also not like like not only that like work your ass off so so you can enjoy yeah yeah you taking a shot you know you you may not live to be old but what if you do and you worked your ass off when you were able and you were able to [ __ ] get up early able to grind if you frontload it properly the back half of your [ __ ] life is money and that's what I did the second I realized that man you are a piece of [ __ ] we got to get going because at 47 man you're not GNA be able to do any of this [ __ ] 50 whatever you are so I front loaded so all these bad things have happened to me I sit back man how are you handling this so well [ __ ] i' I've done it I front loaded I have the money I need I have the success I need I have the [ __ ] the the determination the willpower and also the pride in myself so when I wake up every morning I know who the [ __ ] I am I frontload it perfectly so I don't care what's taken from me but it's got to still there got to be a strange position to be in where your body is your medium the body is the vehicle for you to express yourself right and your body's breaking down mhm and I know that they considered doing knee Replacements on you too yep and what was that conversation like it was it was very basic man it's like hey you know you're you're not going to be able to do some of the [ __ ] that you've done even though obviously people are but that was a conversation and I know it sounds weird it was totally fine with me it was fine because I had dude people don't understand this this wasn't like a a part-time job man when you've done without like Kobe Bryant when Kobe [ __ ] retired at last game he like 60 points or some [ __ ] he walked off the court he didn't [ __ ] cry he said oh my God I'm going to miss the sport what the [ __ ] he walked off he gave he gave everything he could man when you [ __ ] give what I've given and [ __ ] like to say oh you [ __ ] you you don't [ __ ] know [ __ ] which makes me who I am I've given everything people make oh you you ran on [ __ ] up knees you taped your feet up you blah blah you had two heart surg you kept on going yep sure did I had somewhere to [ __ ] go I had somewhere to [ __ ] go and I got there and Buddy when [ __ ] tell you you can take a break now hey you're [ __ ] up as long as my knees are halfway worked I got to run you're telling me man may maybe chance I can't run no more H give me an excuse to [ __ ] not do [ __ ] but as long as I have no excuse I gotta do it but I I was I was happy where I was I gave everything I give everything to who I am and that's why I'm people I don't believe that don't don't believe it I gave everything and when you give everything man you have no regret people didn't understand me people don't understand me now I don't give a [ __ ] I know exactly what I was doing I'm not a masochist I'm not crazy I'm not this and that people try to title me and label me no I had something to [ __ ] do well the way I describe it to people when people ask me like why does he do all these things like what is what is the motivation here I go he's on a mental Journey that very few people have ever been on because the what people don't understand you they or they misunderstand you or they purposely misinterpret the way you're living your life you're trying to understand your mind in a way that very few human beings ever get to understand their mind because you're taking your mind into these terrible Dark Places all the time and you're trying to pull things out of that you're trying to to learn things about yourself and about your potential from that that's exactly it and that's what people don't understand I studi the darkness you you find no [ __ ] answers in the light none it's too happy it's too nice and we're not we don't need to be taught how to live in happiness that that just comes naturally to us happy moments but the dark times man you can't and you can't get there unless you put yourself there life will take you there but when you get into those dark moments that's why people that's why people how are you able man I couldn't [ __ ] read and write to I was a junior in high school how are you able to write like this man [ __ ] I go to such places in my mind and I study the darkness like it's not just physical when I was growing up and I saw my mom getting beat and I got beat and I was some stuttering little black kid in allh school and I'm on stage and I gotta say one line one [ __ ] line in front of [ __ ] 15 people and I walk up stage kind with [ __ ] stutter all those insecurities and all those [ __ ] things man I used to go home and [ __ ] cry like my God man I'm [ __ ] up I'm just all [ __ ] up I I'm hang on man as I got older we got to study this [ __ ] man the only way we're g to [ __ ] get through this if we study it so every time I'm in a dark moment and life's [ __ ] up around me whether it be physical or just life I get in it man with a [ __ ] pen and paper I'm like okay this [ __ ] sucks I can feel like I'm [ __ ] losing my [ __ ] but let's [ __ ] study this let's come out of the this [ __ ] genius you know I studed the I studied the the the the black matter of the Mind the dark matter you know like [ __ ] stepen Hawkins that's if that's [ __ ] his name I said it right that [ __ ] studied the space and [ __ ] yeah that's where I consider myself man you know I I was on a journey just like you said I mean you you you couldn't have said any better and so many people get it wrong and I don't give a [ __ ] man you can't for me I cannot help people there's a lot of cookie cutter [ __ ] out here in this world discipline wake up early take coach shower [ __ ] this [ __ ] that whatever it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not but what they don't teach you within the cookie cutter is like our minds are like a [ __ ] garage and the garage if you open a garage and it's all cluttered up it's all [ __ ] up you can't put your car in there you got [ __ ] boats and you got [ __ ] kids toys and [ __ ] everywhere but if you organize that [ __ ] garage and you put everything rightful spot you can pull that car in there you can put two cars in there you can put bikes in there and that's like with the Mind people talk about discipline and [ __ ] determination and [ __ ] you know repetitions and all this [ __ ] consistency why people fall off the wagon so often is because their mind is full of [ __ ] there's no room in that mind for discipline there's no room for consistency they may do it once or twice but then the mind takes over in that cluttered [ __ ] garage comes in and then it's like a circuit breaker man a circuit breaker just overloads and it [ __ ] Sparks and our minds that's that's our mind man it's like a [ __ ] circuit breaker that so much [ __ ] in it you keep on loading it you can't put any more into it so I've I talk about it in there man so much about clearing space in your [ __ ] mind so then you have room for all those discipline waking up early taking those because they they they do mean something but we don't get to that [ __ ] dark matter that is keeping you from clearing out that mental garage that's a good way to put it because that is the mind of most people is filled with stuff that they have to move around to get to what they want and it's constantly piling up and there [ __ ] unorganized and organized mind man you're looking at the [ __ ] I got to take care of the kids the kids scals was all [ __ ] up my husband my my wife you know I'm I I [ __ ] I'm going by McDonald's to get this and I'm in my schedule everything's just [ __ ] I wish I was doing this but I'm doing that and that and this and I want a raise but I can't get one my boss an [ __ ] where's greatness in that man you can't you you can't fit discipline into that you can't fit structure you can't fit consistency you can't fit to grind and then when you try it just gets [ __ ] it gets [ __ ] overrun by the [ __ ] clutter in your [ __ ] up mental garage when you are in these dark places and you're Gathering up these lessons how difficult is it to try to bring that back and convey it to people when you're not in that space like when you're in that space when you're in the Moab 240 and you're going uphill and you're in the middle of the it's just deep suck right how do you convey where that mental fortitude comes from how do you bring that back it's almost like you've got something you can't even hold in your hand and you want to show it to people I take snapshots so every time I'm in a bad situation like you know I I study it and that's the only reason I do have to [ __ ] I do is I'm studying this [ __ ] because I know that I never thought I was G to be writing books and trying to help people get better but I'm I was always trying to do it because I knew I sucked and so when you know you're trying to get somewhere you know you suck you know that you you believe that you're a born loser you are taking snapshots man like you know you you see something on your phone like oh man I'm going to take a [ __ ] snapshot of that or how you do the little picture [ __ ] so you can save it on your phone I do that in my mind so I get in these moments I'm like [ __ ] okay wow that's some [ __ ] good knowledge right there man I snapshot it because I know that I can use that later I can I can I can use this because I'm not out there just I'm not most people they go out and they run and they go out and they do and they're like oh this is beautiful look at the [ __ ] Mountains and the [ __ ] and all this [ __ ] no I don't like it my body hurts I'm hurting how do we get through this and it's a [ __ ] it's a it's it's a lab it's my mental lab and I and so when I come home I'm not forgetting it and the second I every day I get done running every day I get through work and every day I get through studying whatever it is that brings me to that place of knowledge I come home and that book was mostly written on scratched piece of paper in hand so I come home from from running and I write everything out I write everything out all those things and as I'm running I'm talking about it so all these things that pop my head as I continue to run I'm going through it I'm I'm starting to layer it down I'm starting to break it down into okay that happened okay now now let's layer this because that's just not how it happened it just didn't happen that way what led up to this and so it becomes Me by myself in school I'm literally going to school right now and I'm learning so when I come home I write it out and and then I'm able to write out and I'm able to think about it and say okay oh this is good [ __ ] this is this will help me later on and then it becomes what it is now and when you try to convey it to people what what do you when when you're writing it out and when you're talking about it like what are you thinking are you thinking that this is going to get into someone's mind and this is going to help them motivate themselves are you just trying to express yourself and let them do with it what they can I'm them you're them I'm them I and the [ __ ] up thing about me why I'm able to do it the way I'm able to do it I'm not above them I was never above them a lot of people write where they are they write where they are oh yeah like [ __ ] you right now writing you have a good life man you have a [ __ ] good life I don't write from that place I write from the place that I am the the the the the place that created who I am I go back to that place I call going back to scratch I can't write about David goggin now David goggin now is a success people want to get to be to feel whatever success is for them they want to feel that so I can't write it here at David goggin successful I must write at David gogin [ __ ] man I'm a [ __ ] I don't feel good about myself and every day I go through that Journey so that's where it comes from it comes from scratch all that [ __ ] all my knowledge comes from going back to where the real growth growth doesn't happen when you make it so far in life you make it so high up the whatever it is whatever you're trying to be there's no more growth there's small growth but you remember back when you [ __ ] tried to become Joe Rogan you are now how much growth was in that tons of growth learning lessons learn so I go I always RIS that's why I'm a [ __ ] wildland firefighter now wh why I'm a [ __ ] smoke jumper I don't need to do that [ __ ] at all but I don't learn learn anything from where I'm at now there's no knowledge up here the knowledge is down there in the [ __ ] muck so that's where I write that's where I go back that's where I learn I always go back to school always go back to the basics I always go back to first grade and how much of that is tied to doing things physically though there's like there's a there's a certain kind of physical struggle that you go through particularly with what you excel at which is endurance athlete work when when there's a mental and physical thing that happens when the two of them are together it doesn't happen in anything else like you can do hard work hard mental work and it's very difficult and I'm sure you can learn a lot from that right but it doesn't have the physical pain that comes with the suck of endurance work yes there's nothing nothing in the world that you're able I'm able to get let's say I that Moab 240 I was in 62 hours [ __ ] sucked it's just with blown out knees blown out knees literally the a few days before the race I'm getting them drained Before the Race so that's in your [ __ ] mind man like it ain't like oh I show up to start like oh this is [ __ ] great I'm gonna [ __ ] have a good time out here no I'm thinking all right let's have my [ __ ] knees drained like I'm I'm in pain at Mile zero and that's in your brain I have 240 miles of [ __ ] ahead of me and there's nothing in life nothing in life this is why I love Endurance Sports so much I love it and I hate it it's LoveHate relationship 62 hours I equate that to [ __ ] seven years of life you can't get that man so what I know that Ultra does for me is it packs in it packs in I can't I can't live several lifetimes I can't see because the knowledge I need to gain for this life I live in today I need two or three or four lifetimes to be where I want to go Ultra gives it to me in [ __ ] high definition real fast 62 hours you go out there [ __ ] suffer you come back oh that was 62 hours I gained seven [ __ ] years of knowledge the ups and downs the pain The Suffering The the you you learn how to chunk the [ __ ] down like oh my God man I'm at Mile 100 how the [ __ ] am I get toor 118 everything becomes you you start to learn Life out there and you learn so much in such a condens period of time and nothing in the world can do it like pushing yourself to the absolute limit I I I caught like so people have talent people have a lot of talent and this is going beyond your talent so when Talent when there's no more Talent what happens happens to you most people quit people only go to their talent level and once their talent level is gone it becomes a mental game that that whole mental game sets in then and most people can only perform to their talent and they realize man why am I always messing up right here why why why is this like my big my big hurdle it's because you're performing to your talent and then after that your mind has nothing for you nothing for you I see I see Fighters I see Runners I see people who they're great but they get to the edge of their talent it's like [ __ ] man what what's what's up because you're now at the point now where you're talented could do [ __ ] for you my friend now it's the mental game and that's where people get lost in life get lost in that next level and that next level is found for me in the things that I do just misunderstood that's a giant problem with Fighters yep there's many fighters that are Elite level in the gym but when they get tired and when they get pushed and when they get into that there's a when the world starts narrowing and the walls start closing in and they can't see peripherally anymore Y and they're exhausted and they start making mistakes so all of their understanding of what to do next gets clapped outed because they're thinking about quitting they're thinking about being exhausted when am I going to get a break how much do I have left in a tank can I even push forward here or will I gas out and risk getting stopped and that is exactly what you said goes on into the human mind yeah when Talent when you have a talent problem yeah it's exactly what goes on your mind so how are you going to [ __ ] defeat that bro you're sitting there getting beat the [ __ ] down by a [ __ ] just on you [ __ ] just going you down take down take down take down hit in the face hit in the face and all it's going through your mind is what you just [ __ ] said there's no positivity in that but when you train the mind the way I train mine [ __ ] ready man [ __ ] ready because first of all I didn't have much talent so I had to train one [ __ ] thing you better train your [ __ ] mind because my talents going to run out way early when [ __ ] got hard for me back in the day bro I'm done I'm out see you okay I got to invent a [ __ ] that can so I invented goggin I invented a [ __ ] that that that realized we're not good enough but gogins realizes we're mentally strong as [ __ ] and we're going to outstrength these [ __ ] in the mind there's a big um there's an understanding in fighting that sometimes Talent is a curse because some people are very talented and they just don't work as hard you know uh khabib Nur off talks about that and he's one of the greatest mixed martial arts fighters of all time one of the rare guys to retire undefeated but he's like talented guys don't work hard enough no he's like talented guys the problem with talented guys is they can get by early they're they're like faster than people maybe they just have a better understanding or better coordination some people just you know we're not even like people are not even in their abilities when it comes to sports some people are just very gifted yes but gifted fighters in particular they just there's something about it where a lot of them never realize their full potential no because they don't develop that mental game that you're talking about they don't have to because they could piece people up on the outside they win fights easy they stop a bunch of people in the first round they look like a hero but then when someone comes along that can survive that first round and then start dragging him into hell that's right oh and you see and that's you said you drag a [ __ ] into hell who's a [ __ ] who's a demon yeah you're in the long for a long race and and they're hard people with a talent problem who are so talented they're hard to train they're hard to push if if if you're their coach and you trying to get them to see that we got to get you past this Talent problem we got we got to get you to the point where you're into that mental Zone because we got to get you way past your talent and it's it's hard for coaches to take these these f or whoever past their talent and on the other side is that is where they gain true true levels the the the levels Beyond talent that that's where it really is because if you're able to take a [ __ ] down to Deep End while [ __ ] just putting his toe in feeling the water and [ __ ] if it my first in the deep end he would take you down there and he's mentally strong it's over it's over man they because they because they live in the deep end they live in it man they thrive in it you it's almost like you have to have the ability to go to the deep end no matter whether or not you'll ever go there right yes and some people are like well I'm never going to go to the deep end but you should be able to yes 100% you have to be trained to do it you have to be trained for it for that time comes you're like okay I'm deep in qualified yeah I am deep in [ __ ] qualified I got my [ __ ] deep in certification but you know what's interesting about this book is you talk about how there was moments even though you're clearly deep end qualified clearly deep end certified yes sir you took some time and you hadn't been a deep end for a while and you like I'm kind of a part-time Savage now right this is kind of [ __ ] and you're recognizing it in yourself even though you know your ability you know your history you know what you've been capable of doing in the past you're like but I haven't been there nope I haven't been there in a while and you had to go back what's funny about that part-time Savage thing in there man where I [ __ ] totally dogged myself because the truth um all this became nice waking up [ __ ] bakon in eggs [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] protein shake early morning [ __ ] and I stopped having those hard conversations with myself boy my whole life that's why motherfu hate my ass boy because I'm hard on me if I'm hard on me I don't give a [ __ ] about you I don't give a [ __ ] about what you think I don't give a [ __ ] you think about me nothing else hard on myself bro every morning I woke up all right [ __ ] I call my morning meeting my morning me we all have these [ __ ] meetings all [ __ ] day long you know we go to work we're we're working for somebody else they want a meeting because they want to be successful so we all sit our ass down try to make them better try to make them more money try to make them more powerful we don't do that for ourselves so every morning I wake up I used to I I had to get back into it again because in that chapter you see I became a little [ __ ] that morning meeting I wake up okay goggin what did you do [ __ ] up yesterday where were you at and I go through and analyze my life and then went through a period of time there man where I stopped having those conversations you know how you let's say you and your wife go out let's say I don't I don't know just make up a story here you and your wife go out and you see your cousin and your cousin's fat as [ __ ] I don't know I don't know they are not hopefully not if they are apologize maybe so they go out and you see your cousin she's fat as [ __ ] he's fat as [ __ ] whoever and you guys get back in the car and you guys man you see [ __ ] Mary Joe how that she was that's what we do we go back in the hard conversation that you should be having with Mary Joel hey Mary Joel you [ __ ] gained some weight huh sister [ __ ] kind of big that's what I do to myself a lot of people that we see all day long we see them you don't have the hard conversation with we we walk around I rather you [ __ ] hate me and get better than like me and stay the same and that's how I feel about David Goggins [ __ ] I rather me hate I hating you David man I hate you David but I get better from it I get better from it and that's why when people see me and I know you you're you're in my little Foxhole if you're in my Foxhole and you become a piece of [ __ ] hey come here brother let me talk to you real quick Brother people don't like that [ __ ] man but I'm not going to allow you to go to a place that's going to be hard to get out of it's G to be hard if I allow you gain five more pounds or allow you take four more days off of school or like to keep on procrastinating in your [ __ ] life and I see and I tell Jennifer behind your back I'm doing you no [ __ ] Justice zero justice so where this world is now you can't say a [ __ ] thing I do I still do and I always will don't like me don't like me I'm good with that that's exactly what's going on with like fat models that's it I'm proud like you're beautiful no matter what but that's not true and the thing about it is I have no problem if you want to be fat I have no problem with anybody if you want to be whatever the [ __ ] you want to be but make sure you [ __ ] if you're fat [ __ ] go go be fat go be real [ __ ] fat but let's be real nobody wants to be fat nobody does that's why I said it man nobody does that's not true they will pretend I'm fine with it but if I could give you a button that you could push and boink be skinny all of a sudden you'd have this incredible body take everybody would push that button but what happens is man we get in this world where it gets hard yeah and so the harder it is the more you start to push back and the more you push back and then it's not right for people to talk about it's not right for like let's say you are fat I was fat that's why I talk about it go ahead and say something [ __ ] I was fat too and it was hard as [ __ ] every [ __ ] day to get up I know what it feels like when you roll your fat ass out of bed and all you want is some [ __ ] damn cinnamon buns and [ __ ] and [ __ ] CH chocolate milkshakes I I know what it is I know exactly what it is but I can't want it more than you and so many people just want it the easy way it I'm sorry man it's not so what they start to do is they build this Narrative of it's okay when the narrative should be you need to [ __ ] work harder you need to [ __ ] discipline your mind better we need to help people more than just saying it's okay it's okay that you're not [ __ ] willing to [ __ ] help yourself out that's not not okay it's not okay it's not acceptable even though it's your life if that's if if that's acceptable that's unacceptable and there's a lot of people in this world me included that if I accepted that I wouldn't be anywhere so yeah a lot of people just [ __ ] they they start creating a narrative about themselves that make it okay the ultimate get out jail free card and now the world is set up to have so many gel free cards everything is okay and you can't say a [ __ ] thing about it this is what it's interesting though is that when you're talking about how you had to come to this realization that You' become a part-time Savage this is recently yeah that's uh you're looking at 200 no 2018 yeah yeah 2018 not that long ago no [ __ ] no yeah so even though you've been through all those things and you have all this information in your head it's like there's no rest no you never get a chance and if you do take a little time and start enjoying it all of a sudden that General in the back of your head is like hey hey look what you're doing exactly you're being a little [ __ ] and so in your mind you had gotten soft oh 100% And my softness was still two days so if you look in there two a days was you being soft my part-time Savage was me running like 50 miles a week me [ __ ] not you know because what what I used to do and what I do now is I got to a point I be running I was like okay man we could do 10 miles today I get I get to 10 miles like oh no [ __ ] that [ __ ] demon that I let out every [ __ ] morning that walks the streets at night he comes say no [ __ ] not today man there's somebody out there that you don't know have never [ __ ] met in your entire life that is doing 12 13 14 going to do another one and when you meet him you ain't gonna be [ __ ] ready so goggin kept on running so you talk about that and uh you talk about how cam came to visit you in Vegas and gave you a spot check oh yeah oh yeah I'm always ready for a [ __ ] like cam I'm always ready for a mother like cam so out of nowhere dude this guy calls me literally and this is one thing about life this is why you always must be ready always be ready never get ready people go oh hey what do you training for David I ain't training for [ __ ] when something pops up I'll be [ __ ] ready so when Cam Pop the [ __ ] up and cam calls hey man I'm going to be in uh Las Vegas you want to go for a run sure do sure do brother sure do while the Run sucked I was ready well you guys were doing like six minute miles for like 26 miles it was Brut it was 20 miles and Jennifer was with us and so Jennifer can run her [ __ ] ass off she's fast as [ __ ] so we went out but she's not a six-minute mile Runner so we went out for the first first 10 and Jennifer is with us she was with us for the first seven she turned around I think she did like 15 miles so me and Cam went out after we left Jennifer she went back for another three to go out and get 10 and come back 10 but my whole idea was I know the course [ __ ] I'm about to drop your [ __ ] ass [ __ ] so we go out cause because going out is a little bit um as old I think it was a little bit uphill no a little bit downhill a little bit downhill so a little bit downhill so we turn around 10 Mile Mark come back and I could tell Cam was hurting boy but Cam's a prideful [ __ ] dude prideful [ __ ] love that dude so we get to about mile 16 17 and I could tell now he kind of comes off my shoulder slightly and I'm like oh [ __ ] in the armor I feel it you know you eyes kind looking at you know out you know out of your prip vision but I'm like this is a prideful [ __ ] man and keep on going man holding sixes we gets about mile 18 I look Cam's right back on the shoulder I just smiled I said you are exactly who the [ __ ] I thought you were a [ __ ] and so we went out tested each other man good day went to the gym worked out hard went and got some steak same day same oh we [ __ ] worked it out dude whenever meet him together you can guarantee it's G to be two people that love each other but are waiting for the other [ __ ] to break 100% dude it's like this thing in the back of her head okay maybe this will break them maybe this will break him so we haven't broken each other yet but I'm sure the day will come so so you run 20 miles and then you lift weights but see lifting weights people like people don't get it man it's not like lifting weights it's like you know we go and do like so many reps like people go oh you're only doing um was like 90 some pounds on the incline [ __ ] do five sets of 2 five with a super set of push-ups super set of curls super set of pull-ups super set of triceps super set of what the [ __ ] else was I forget it's a super set man so we're going through lifting lightweight but for massive massive amounts of reps and so you're like totally swollen and like it's just the some some of the best workouts in the world between me and him some of the best workouts in the world man and then you had steak and then we had steak that's right then and then I treat can to a steak right and that's a mental aid station mental oh yes mental Aid stations baby I think one of the most important parts about the way you express yourself in your books is that you do talk about your weaknesses and you you do talk about your past and how you started off on this journey and you talk about how there are those moments that you doubt oh yeah and you but you still go oh yeah sometimes like you know I call it uh you got call an audible you know the line of scrimmage man like some of the great quarterbacks they'll be at the line of scrimmage and they'll look at the defense the defense is oh [ __ ] defense is Shifting then he calling audible in my mind a lot of times man I'm like it doesn't mean I quit I don't quit you know I may not make it the first time but I'll come back I gota call an audible I gotta [ __ ] I gotta I gotta [ __ ] get my head back in the game I gotta I gotta figure this [ __ ] out it doesn't mean you leave it means you study it more it means you study it more and and whenever I feel at something people I say man how do you handle failure man I fail a lot dude I fail all the [ __ ] time they go how do you handle it what I'm trying to do and this isn't being arrogant man I I it's being real not many people are trying to do so there's not many people that who who can even open their [ __ ] mouth and criticize me when I do fail because I'm on I'm I'm I'm trying to do [ __ ] man that many people aren't trying to do but I don't look at failure as failure I look at failure as your first second third fourth fifth attempt I look at them as attempts I don't look at anything as failure because when you're willing to try to do some not trying is failure that's that's and that's not some after school special [ __ ] but when you're able to go out there there there is no failure it's attempts because when you're trying to do something that's bigger than you whatever you are whoever you are if if if you're paralyzed you trying to walk one step and you didn't you didn't fail [ __ ] that was your first attempt if that's your biggest thing that's how your mindset needs to go into everything so I don't look at it as failure is a big word like that gets people down and [ __ ] we give so much power to words I don't I take the power right away I didn't feel [ __ ] do you ever have conversations with Cam about mindset we no we we we really don't go there too much at all about mindset like whenever we get together it's really about breaking the [ __ ] down like it's like it's like but wouldn't you be interested though in how he approach because I don't know if everybody shares your approach I know there's not very many people like you right cam is one of them right so like how many of them are like you and how many of them have that sort of similar approach and how many of them are willing to discuss their own demons because a lot of people that are like super endurance athletes or very hard people they don't ever want to even discuss the weakness they don't want to shine any light on it no people hate that yeah people hate it man and I love it and the re hate it to me this is just my own theory is because you haven't beat it that's why people go man why are you so open and vulnerable I'll tell you everything I lied about everything I [ __ ] up with every I'll tell you everything I am an open [ __ ] book I don't give a [ __ ] the only reason why I don't give a [ __ ] anymore is because I overcame it and I beat it so I'm will to talk about it why most people aren't willing to go to that darkness and that vulnerability is because they're still dealing with it when people who have overcome it they're open [ __ ] book bro because they're proud they're [ __ ] proud that's why I speak man man why are you always yelling guys [ __ ] you this how I talk [ __ ] cuz I'm proud motherfu you know what I'm saying I'm a proud [ __ ] man it's not proud like look at me it's like [ __ ] I know where I [ __ ] came from [ __ ] I shouldn't be here right now talking to you shouldn't be talking to you [ __ ] I shouldn't be here I us a fat sloppy [ __ ] I'm proud so I'm able to tell you I was [ __ ] up many people can't you know that's a common thing that people say when I interview them after fights like I'm not supposed to be here this is not supposed to happen to me I not there's a common thing when I've had conversations with people and they you know they've won a big fight they've had this big event right they they say I wasn't supposed to be here right statistically like Chris Gutierrez just said that uh last UFC fight when I interviewed him he like I'm not supposed to be here right probably because they come from a bad place exactly you know they and when you're in a bad especially when you're young you know redevelop self-esteem you know by the age of seven if you're if if if you're not good by the age of seven or eight years old you have a good chance of being [ __ ] the rest of your life yeah so if your parents or or you came up wrong and then seven or eight if you don't have the self-esteem but you [ __ ] grind you're like I want to be better when you get to that UFC Championship or you get to where where I got or where I am it's almost like you can't believe the journey like I talked about in that [ __ ] VFW and I'm in the first chapter of that book man I'm sitting in that audience all those [ __ ] people and I'm about to get the you know americanism award and I was grinding so hard I never took time to reflect in my life and this was like time to reflect and I was all kind of [ __ ] up I got on stage man just [ __ ] cried for like 59 seconds and it was such an emotional moment for me that I [ __ ] that I [ __ ] did what I did and I I overcame and it was it was alone man you know a lot of people have [ __ ] like teammates and [ __ ] like you know family push my my mom was struggling bro she was strug so it was like me and my mom and so it's a lot of just me so when you're waking up every morning by yourself and you're [ __ ] getting after by yourself and and it's the it's the hidden work people see one minute you know video of me running and [ __ ] like and like these Fighters you know they they see during the fight or after the fight they don't see these [ __ ] man what they deal with every [ __ ] day I'm not good enough I'm not good enough I shouldn't be here I shouldn't be here because every day even though they're [ __ ] the best in the world that little [ __ ] at seven or eight years old is still in there saying oh man we we don't have so we're not good enough we're not we shouldn't be here so you're always fighting that [ __ ] even though you beat it you never truly beat it so when they get on stage and talking to Joe Rogan it's it's a it's not even real it's not even real all those mornings that you didn't want to [ __ ] get up and and I look at it as like a [ __ ] like a rock and you find this [ __ ] rock and that rock is you and every day you [ __ ] fight not wanting to get up and you do anyway you chip another piece off that [ __ ] rock and every day you [ __ ] eat the right foods and every day you go to train you train harder and harder and harder and harder and you get up earlier and all these things you do to start forming yourself you're chipping another [ __ ] piece of that rock up before you know it you have this beautiful [ __ ] piece of of of of artwork that that you built but people don't and then once you get there you see it and it becomes real like oh my God I [ __ ] did this [ __ ] and so like the [ __ ] Journey becomes so real then but so many people aren't willing to [ __ ] chip away at that stone that is them to start chipping off those [ __ ] rough edges that's the fear the fear is never reach ing your potential that's it that always falling short always quitting before you're done always procrastinating always not doing the right thing and then one day you're an old man yep and you look back and go God I could have been great yep I could have been great I never forget one time I was running by a graveyard and I was [ __ ] just trying to become I was fat and I ran by a graveyard and I looked out there and I have all these epiphanies man I have all these [ __ ] moments of like of it's crazy man of of this thought I'm always by myself I'm always in deep [ __ ] thought about how to be better I look out there I'm like man I wonder how many of you [ __ ] in there [ __ ] just are so upset with how you lived your life and [ __ ] just regret how you lived it and I'm running at 300 pound man thinking man don't [ __ ] die like this bro don't die like this so people wonder where this [ __ ] comes from from me it comes from such deep thought of trying to see what this is all about what is this life all about what am I all about why am I here you know I had to I had to find purpose and my suffering it had a purpose it had a [ __ ] purpose do you talk to other people that are like you and try to understand if they're going through the same thing are they're trying to gather knowledge as well are they just doing it because they're addicted to Runner's High are they doing it because they enjoy the challenge like how many people do you talk to that are like you I've never talked to anyone that and most people don't even believe what I say half the time that I I I do it to [ __ ] gain knowledge and all that [ __ ] I haven't met one that goes out there people really enjoy a lot of the [ __ ] that they do like like they I don't know many people can go out and run 240 miles at one time if you don't enjoy it if if you just don't don't really enjoy it so you know I I had many people build confidence different ways and they build belief in different ways coming from where I came from I didn't have any belief in myself so some people can go read a book and get belief some people can go take a yoga class have good parents I had to put myself some where I came from was so far down underneath like soil that I had to build belief by truly ingraining it in my brain so the things I do I'm always every day building belief and my belief had to be where it is because I was so far down so it may take a 200 mile run for me it may take a 100 mile run it may take late nights in the gym but without belief you have nothing and I realized that when I was a young kid I have no belief I have to build it and a fivemile run didn't do it I had to push myself to such extremes because I came from people judge me by not knowing where I came from so unless you're me and you came from where I came from I guarantee you would have made it out guarantee it and I knew that so my belief comes from going I had to build it and that's how I build it man I build it by the things I do it's so painful reading about your childhood and the experiences with your father and then when you went back and met your father as an adult and got with them and watched him get drunk and then watch him get belligerent and and experience it all over again and then think about what happened to him to make him who he is yeah that [ __ ] me up dude but I had to go like I realized I was [ __ ] I was I was just a sorry [ __ ] you know I quit peir rescue I spray the water every time [ __ ] got hard like I said I didn't have talent you know I I [ __ ] didn't have [ __ ] and whenever [ __ ] got hard for me I thought I was on my way out and and I got suck back in I become I become a loser again real quick and I see him all the time there's a lot of [ __ ] losers out here that won't face it I like oh man gota go back and visit this [ __ ] I I haven't seen my dad in [ __ ] years man years but I knew where I came from I knew where my mindset came from I knew where my demons were so my whole idea when I went back to see my dad was I was hoping that I could just [ __ ] call myself a losion it's because of you Dad so I was hoping to go back and get the confirmation that I always wanted that wasn't my fault that voice in my head was so loud it's not your fault David it's not your fault you can't read and write it's not your fault that people call you [ __ ] [ __ ] it's not your fault it's not your fault this not your fault that it's not your fault that you're fat it's not your fault that you're that that you quit [ __ ] it's not your fault so so I was like okay man I'm going go back visit this [ __ ] so I can just squash it and I can just go on and be a [ __ ] loser cuz you [ __ ] me up and when I got there went drove to Buffalo saw my dad same routine as it was when I was 8 years old man walked in what's up went to Skate Land I sat on that [ __ ] couch that he would cheat on my mom with I sat on that couch in the corner and I was like God what the [ __ ] man and it was a whole normal day and the more I was around him he started now he started getting drunk and and I won't go through the whole thing but I started seeing man I started having a convers I always have these conversations with myself like man this [ __ ] he came from Hell his dad would put him in front of a furnace and like if he moved he get burnt so when when when my dad got beat um his dad would put him from the furnace and if he would have move he'd [ __ ] get burnt up so my dad's had to sit there and take it so he never dealt with [ __ ] demons so his demons became mine his demons became mine [ __ ] think you die and and and the demon goes with you man don't be a [ __ ] fool bro you know like that's why I'm proud of myself I took his demons and mine and people are always looking for some great [ __ ] apology you know oh my God like um you know my my dad need to say sorry people who [ __ ] called you out your name or nobody couldn't come back and say sorry to you you [ __ ] ain't nobody saying [ __ ] to you you better a [ __ ] man the [ __ ] up so I looked at him he didn't face his demons I'm going to face mine so on that drive back home that's what I started doing you know what's one of the most most [ __ ] up things that I've learned over time is that almost all like truly exceptional and mentally strong people have been through hell it's it's very few that put themselves through hell when life is great it's just not usually the case right and to to achieve the the the standards that you've achieved to achieve the to become the person that you are today and to have the influence that you have this Global influence on people do you how many people have laced up their shoes because they heard your voice how many people have just moved into action and changed their life because they've heard you talk or seen you talk it's it's there's a thing that happened and it happened out of hell and I don't think it ever happens without that it's like you had to go through that in order to empower all these other people in order to become who you are and that as an example and then your words as an example and your describing of it and then your description of your own shortcomings and failures that give people confidence that you it's not like you're this superhuman person that is like a character in a book right now you're a real human being who has real insecurities and real failur in your past and and and real demons and you figured out a way to harness that energy and just keep going forward yep and not quit that's it that's it I mean there there are no timeouts you know people like I you know there's a part in the book that I talk about a prisoner mind and that's about my mother and you know she just um that's I would never listen to that part again in that book that was hard just so you know man like I will never again listen to that [ __ ] your mother's very very very brave oh to be able to talk like that yeah to be able to to be able to talk like that um to the world and to to just she lost her life she lost this giant chunk of her life with this abusive man and to hear her talking about him hitting her and what it was like and the fact that she never came from a family that hit her she had never been hit before never and to to to have her express it the way she did so honestly and openly very powerful and the whole time she's talking man she's on the cusp of like losing it like I'm in the other room so I'm I'm interviewing her and I'm hearing this [ __ ] so I I knew a lot about it obviously I lived it and that's what [ __ ] me up the most man when you see like I said I wasn't a smart kid growing up but who whatever made me whatever the [ __ ] made me I'm so [ __ ] my mind is sharp man like it's it's crazy like I could I was so aware of so much [ __ ] I was so bright in that way and to see your mom go through that [ __ ] as that young kid and like I was going through it and she was going through right beside me like when I got my ass beat she got her ass beat it was it's [ __ ] up man like you you you just can't you know people you know people like to judge who you are man why you cuss so much man my life wasn't [ __ ] PG [ __ ] like you know you can't just turn who the [ __ ] you are off when you see your mom going that kind of [ __ ] and then I'm coming to her defense at seven or eight years old and she's getting her [ __ ] ass beat by a 220 lb man and I'm [ __ ] some little kid know what kind of Courage it takes to Muster that up to go help her out and to see her [ __ ] up like that and the time she would cry and be bruised up and [ __ ] it was just it was a it was a [ __ ] nightmare and then hear her talk about it like the part where my dad says I brought this belt from Texas this belt came all the way from Texas whip your ass with I it it was like what the like where am I at right now cuz I knew no other households right were [ __ ] living like this man I and and I knew it I knew it and then she was shut off she was shut off from the world and when I wrote can't hurt me she refused she said [ __ ] don't put my [ __ ] in there she was so embarrassed you know like like I put in there man she [ __ ] married a [ __ ] prisoner so my mom was so [ __ ] up she was so [ __ ] up by this [ __ ] and people go people go man you're a mama's boy [ __ ] I know mama's boy man see your mom go through this [ __ ] you're gonna make sure she's taken care of so she came out and one of the people that you know she she got married a few times CU she was looking for something that my dad stripped from her and she was out she was gone for years she just now coming back she's 70s she's 75 and but in that book I talk about man she's like don't don't put that you know and can't hurt me but now she's getting better and she's allowing me more to talk more about my life which was also some of her life the part about marrying a prisoner is so crazy dude it was a [ __ ] but not just a prisoner but a prisoner who killed a woman dude this so it was so [ __ ] up it's hard for me to talk about because it's almost like it I was I had a front row seat at a horror show so when my mom left my dad she went to wilmouth and he got murdered I talk about that can't hurt me he got murdered so that took her all the way over the edge I mean he got shot [ __ ] six times and the last shot this [ __ ] got right up up on his head and made sure he was dead like forehead shot and so she didn't cry she didn't cry she's loost it was over she a whole another person became and so I'm [ __ ] now like 12 13 14 what the [ __ ] I was I'm watching this woman every day front row seat just watching her just go through life [ __ ] up and then I'm about to go in the military into the Air Force and like two years out man you know I'm like a sophomore in high school phone ringing every night she tell me don't get on the phone don't get on the phone don't get on the phone 15 minute calls hang up 15minute call hang up 15minute call hang up what the [ __ ] is going on but see the way I was grow like the way I was raised you don't ask your Mom what's going on it a like now like conversations and [ __ ] with the parents you shut the [ __ ] up and that's I didn't ask [ __ ] but I knew something was [ __ ] cuz like 3 four hours a night 15 minute hang up cuz he was in prison this guy was in prison so he only had 15 minutes on the phone they had to put more money in it how did she meet him she started working so she was always about helping people out but the thing about it was like I was right in front of her and needed so much [ __ ] help and that it was [ __ ] up for me for a long time but she helped out so many people but I guess since I was with her through the Journey I just I didn't count but it's all good man it's what life's about you got to understand what your mom went through so that I can be good with it you know like I saw that so I I had to man up a lot more than what so she saw people needed help so she started teaching in the prison so she had a full-time job at the at the Paul University in Green Castle Indiana and then she started teaching in a prison and she met this prisoner this prisoner obviously I don't know slitter or not or some [ __ ] like that and you know she was looking for anything she was looking for anybody that loved her because my dad beat the [ __ ] life out of her and and my dad so my dad wouldn't marry my mom but ended up marrying a woman um that was tied to like I'm not even gonna go there I'm not trying to get [ __ ] sued and [ __ ] right now man but he he married somebody that was [ __ ] up that's [ __ ] up so anyway um she she she met him in prison and um the phone was ringing every night she didn't tell me about it cuz how you can tell your son hey David I'm I'm I'm I'm in love with the prisoner so before I go who murdered the woman oh no I'm about to get to that brother so I'm [ __ ] now about a week out or whatever the [ __ ] was from leaving for boot camp and she lets me know what's up and so I'm about to leave for boot camp and I'm so protective of my mom and she lays this on me yeah um sit down let me have let's have a talk and she never does this [ __ ] man she's like there was nothing ever hidden from me that's why I grew up so fast like that abusive life and what she was going through it was front and center her her being broke everything this was the only secret she kept from me she go um those phone calls you know I've been uh seeing someone in prison all right cool whatever but I'm thinking what the [ __ ] is this man so you know I hated I didn't want to ask how the [ __ ] did you get to prison so I'm sitting there I'm sitting there I'm sitting there and I'm like okay man I got to [ __ ] ask this [ __ ] question how the [ __ ] you know what what happened you know she's like well does one of those things you know cuz she knows it's [ __ ] bad well he was in the drugs and stuff like that I'm thinking okay maybe drug dealer something like that he was in the drugs that's for sure but he literally I don't know how it went down but he choked a woman to death over some drugs and I don't know the ins and outs or all this other [ __ ] and um that's who she was going to [ __ ] be with and he was getting out of prison literally in a few weeks after I was going to Air Force boot camp Jes so I'm in [ __ ] Air Force boot camp thinking about my mom's about to [ __ ] marry a [ __ ] dude who got sent to prison marry him right away too right away so the first time I meet this [ __ ] dude is at my [ __ ] Air Force graduation oh Jes my [ __ ] Air Force graduation and she was like you ain't putting that [ __ ] in can't hurt me she was embarrassed about it and then she saw how I went totally like [ __ ] vulnerable and she was like [ __ ] it go ahead so there's there's so much more to it but he ended up um uh I think it was last year or maybe this year he ow so my mom divorced him obviously after it it it it didn't work out and she was telling me a story one time we were talking about this book she started opening more up about the relationship with this uh with this prisoner and she said one night they got into a fight you know not not physical you know he never hit her like like my dad did so many times but he said one night she was sleeping and had had her back to him and all she thought about all [ __ ] night was because she started slowly realizing like I'm [ __ ] up like I just married a [ __ ] guy from prison that killed somebody and she started realizing it more and more but she's laying in bed and she and she was like is this [ __ ] gonna [ __ ] kill me tonight and she started telling me these [ __ ] stories man and I'm like and I'm just like what the [ __ ] man like like you know it's it's it was tough it was it was it was a tough way to grow up man it was tough tough way to grow up so yeah he ended up um so they got divorced uh I think it work maybe two years where the [ __ ] it was whatever it doesn't matter and then um I think he ODed last year he OD last year killed himself I don't he killed himself he's OD so the the idea of you going off to boot camp knowing that your mom's going to be alone with this guy getting out of prison yeah that [ __ ] must have been haunting yeah [ __ ] up every night oh my God every night I'm I'm I'm sitting in the [ __ ] in my bunk thinking and then I I I knew the date he was getting out of prison and like you know you can't just get on the phone and call hey Mom what's going on you know no you're in boot camp you get like every now and then they say okay you have like a phone call once a week or some [ __ ] I think every Sunday was a phone call and I'll never forget when he got to the house man I actually got I was [ __ ] not right so I got recycled so a week in boot camp so like I [ __ ] I don't know what I [ __ ] did something in boot camp and [ __ ] got recycled had like I was sneaking the Snickers bars I was just all kind of belligerant and [ __ ] I was just out of it I I was I was sneaking out and this [ __ ] I was just [ __ ] not right I was wasn't right and so then I um yeah that's it was [ __ ] up it's it's [ __ ] up what was it like when you met him I try to be supportive cuz that's what I always did my mom whatever made her happy I try to that that was my [ __ ] number one priority was I I never cared about myself never never ever which makes what I do now for people I I understand because I care about people even though I'm an introvert I'm an introvert because my [ __ ] life sucked but what I do for people I really do that's why I want to make sure that [ __ ] like that that [ __ ] book and things I do that's why I don't [ __ ] like why don't you sell [ __ ] why don't you always you know why aren't you like promoting this and that and no man no I care that you understand that I [ __ ] want to see you [ __ ] kill [ __ ] I want to see you better so you know when I met him I was supportive and I was and I sat back and looked at him and I wanted to [ __ ] beat this [ __ ] down so bad because I knew like you're not a good egg bro you're not a good egg man I'm not saying yeah I mean you know I'm not saying prisoners are B they can be re rehabilitated but I always had these feelings about people if I get around you I can [ __ ] I I may not tell you but when you grow up the way I grow up man you have this you have these ways of knowing pieces of [ __ ] I became an expert in pieces of [ __ ] I used to be one my dad was one so you can [ __ ] pick him out you can pick out liars and all kind of K artists from from a mile away cuz [ __ ] I studied it studied myself I know who you are so you can't come around me bullshitting me man can't right so it's just it was horrible it was horrible so you know like the the one woman I cared about more than anything in the world cuz I saw her hell I'm looking at this [ __ ] now and now I'm have to go to [ __ ] PA rescue school and all this other [ __ ] while she's [ __ ] with this guy so there are a lot of things in my mind that that just made hard that I studied I studied my mind during these times I started and this this process to become who am today of learning life and how hard life is that's why I don't speak about the good times everybody gets so mad why don't you speak about the good times I don't need to help you through those brother I do not need to help you you don't turn on David Goggins to for the good times you turn on David Goggins when you don't feel like doing [ __ ] you're an expert in dark matter dark [ __ ] matter that's what I am so yeah I know it really well so it wasn't like I wished for it one of the things that's hilarious in the book is that you you read all the [ __ ] that people write to you all the hate and you record it and then you play it back brother I'm G to tell you right now man that started honestly when this [ __ ] seal from SEAL Team Six came out and started lying his [ __ ] ass off about me this is an important subject we should talk about this cuz your military career and the what you've done is always misrepresented oh yeah even by people that should know better oh yeah oh they know better but what what makes people feel good like when when you become successful when you become successful and I had to realize this and this guy made me realize this I had to study them when you become successful especially within a fraternity like that like this is this is a fraternity bro this isn't like a [ __ ] like oh like in the Air Force you know it was this is a very different world so several seals no I'm going to say there's a lot that would like to see me [ __ ] a lot they like to see a lot of people not do well and them do great yeah and like they all know we eat our own we eat our own and that's what they all say we eat our own is that all seals I don't know all seals a lot of seals I can't speak that way I know a few seals is it just the hyper competitive nature of the type of people to get involved yeah it's like you know we have this this uh this this this mcho stigma that you know like you know we're we're the best of the best we're [ __ ] we're we're we're the bad [ __ ] in the world and and I I beg to differ you know like people go like I've had so many people in art like the news oh my God they contact me all they want me so bad cuz there's been some things that came up you know the Navy SE Community um this this guy died this this kid going through training died and some Navy Seals I don't know the stories they can Google it where the [ __ ] I guess they kill somebody over in Iraq who has some information some [ __ ] so they always want to get me on so I can [ __ ] because they know that I was not a fan of a lot of Navy SEALs and a lot of it is to do of with the lies the [ __ ] some of the leadership problems some of the character issues and I got to see that a lot when I got out and I'm the one to say it I had a lot of problems myself when I was growing up and it took a long time for me go so I'm not judging these people I know where the [ __ ] comes from man the [ __ ] comes from [ __ ] you haven't handled so I it doesn't even bother me anymore but when I came out um in 2018 this this still from still Team Six he had and Jennifer it pissed Jennifer off so [ __ ] bad and I was cool about it but this guy started YouTube channels saying that I was dishonestly discharged I [ __ ] was kicked out of the SEAL Teams I um I refused to fight in combat I never went to combat I mean every bit of it so the reason why in my and can't hurt me I have my write up of my metal from Iraq and I wasn't going to put that in there but Jennifer started getting DMS from people saying do you know I'm not I'm not even going to name his name that's not who I am dude and I just showed you outside about that one cat yeah I'm not gonna name his name either but I'm not going to name his name because how does he not know better though that's the the the that was one of the things that people bring up that you never deployed right yep why would they say that why you think Joe think about it man think about it see like this the thing but that's something that's easily proven exactly but guess what this guy had Black Ops literally he was he was he had like YouTube channels dming people because people like at this time I started getting a little bigger I started getting a little more profile and he was coming out of the SEAL Teams I'm not gonna say his name because I'm not going to try to take food out of his mouth and this is one thing I learned from all of this I had this I was so [ __ ] pissed man I was so [ __ ] pissed I didn't deploy I mean the [ __ ] lies were insane how many times did you deploy twice one to Guam and one to Iraq and then what they don't talk about though is the reason I didn't deploy more is I had two heart surgeries so I was out of the [ __ ] teams for deploying for like three four years because the heart surgeries because when you get a heart Sur you can't go back to deploy you were born with like holes in your heart right with a hole in my heart and the first surgery it didn't you know it didn't take try to get another surgery so that took so much time having these heart surgeries so I was in um recruiting at the time so this kept me in recruiting so this even added to the whole [ __ ] this added to the whole [ __ ] so they were loving it because right now like I said I wouldn't like the most famous seal within the SEAL Teams I didn't take [ __ ] man it [ __ ] was [ __ ] up I called it I called it there's there's no secret there there's no secret [ __ ] here man and and and I knew what happened when I when I got out and this guy started doing this [ __ ] and I I knew why he was doing it because the biggest thing like he wanted to take my character and destroy it right that's all he wanted to do and so when you're in these kind of communities like this man people like oh no there's no way he was trying to do that man I wish I can get Jennifer here right now we have all the screenshots and I had to get a [ __ ] lawyer I mean this guy went so far and then what happened was over a period of time he [ __ ] literally apologized went away [ __ ] took all this [ __ ] down I mean but he came out and but what happened was that rumor mill spread like wildfire did he have to know did he have to be told about your actual record no he knew never I deployed with him what I deployed with him in Iraq no in Iraq he was just lying in Iraq I deployed with him in the only [ __ ] see man you got get me to the point where I say his [ __ ] name because I swear to God so I deployed with his ass that's why I put the [ __ ] right up in there so I got a medal over there in Iraq I got a medal in Iraq so I did go to war and I put it in the book Because when because Jennifer started getting all this [ __ ] and she goes you got to put that [ __ ] award in there because this [ __ ] is just ly his ass off I didn't go to Ranger school all this [ __ ] so I put the Ranger school everything he said I put in can't hurt me because he was just literally lying trying to literally ruin who I was cuz I'm the world's toughest man that doesn't sit right with some [ __ ] Alpha [ __ ] dude and these [ __ ] dude some of them and you don't know unless you've been in the fraternity like this unless you've been in the fraternity like this you don't [ __ ] know I don't [ __ ] care about them there's some I some great friends in there but anyway the reason this guy actually helped me out so when I came out there's a few guys in that came after me in the seel teams trying to make sure that I [ __ ] wasn't going to be who I am and they still talk their [ __ ] lies lies so many [ __ ] lies dude and what's great about is my proof isn't can't hurt me so everything they say my proof is in and that's why it's designed that way for the Liars but this guy came out and what I do is I studied him so Jennifer goty lawyer I'm about to sue the [ __ ] out of this [ __ ] guy man like I had all this defamation I mean it was [ __ ] a thick I was going to sue the [ __ ] out of him and every night I [ __ ] woke up I was like man I started think about myself when I was a piece of [ __ ] when I had no character when I had no pride no dignity that's CU only people that do [ __ ] like that you're not a man right you're no [ __ ] man dude like I start thinking about what kind of [ __ ] you are man what how you must have so many [ __ ] demons in your life that you spend this kind of time just trying to take another man just trying to take another man and not I it'd be different if it was truth behind it right lies [ __ ] lies yeah just because we didn't get along [ __ ] it don't mean I wasn't who I am we didn't get along [ __ ] cuz I [ __ ] I'm like a lie detector cuz I'm so [ __ ] honest with myself I had such a hard time in my life that I [ __ ] so forthright when you get even near me cuz I [ __ ] you know my [ __ ] is real it's [ __ ] real as [ __ ] it makes you feel bad if you got something going on in your [ __ ] life I Ain open my [ __ ] mouth you know my [ __ ] is [ __ ] real yeah I may not deployed as many times you [ __ ] because my heart issues and the other issues that I won't talk about cuz the [ __ ] news wants me to [ __ ] talk about this [ __ ] so bad they want to take some Ste down so bad I ain't no [ __ ] like that whatever happened to se teams with me it happened to SEAL Teams that's why I don't [ __ ] mention the names but I saw these little [ __ ] come out here it was in the fraternity it happened in the fraternity leave it there don't be a [ __ ] [ __ ] come out here [ __ ] spreading lies about me [ __ ] but I studied all these little [ __ ] who try to come out and ruin my life studied all of them like man what you must be going through is [ __ ] evil I even took a step further I had to mature myself because I was so [ __ ] mad and I looked at his family this guy who was talking this [ __ ] I G to say his name so bad but I never will because that's a [ __ ] [ __ ] move on my part you can take food out of this [ __ ] his family's mouth you're G to have this guy in the courthouse you have him in the courtroom spending money on lawyers and I [ __ ] just [ __ ] dropped it I said I'm good I said I know who the [ __ ] I am I said you can wake up every [ __ ] morning being the [ __ ] that you are but I'm not going to [ __ ] take money out of your pocket and money out of your mouth out of your [ __ ] kids kids mouth and this kid this guy wound up apologizing to you he didn't apologized to me what happened was he got on and I don't want to go too deep because they will figure it out but um he ended up basically saying he's he had a [ __ ] he he just wasn't he wasn't right in his head he was he was you know he wasn't good I and I can tell he wasn't good because he was literally dming people and I I wish I had Jennifer in here man so she can show you the DMS he was deeming people and talking all this [ __ ] and then he would delete it and this guy H how so so so Jennifer found it and so cuz this guy dm' Jennifer and was like um hey can you do you do you know this guy and I was like yeah I know him and then J was like Hey we got to [ __ ] shut this [ __ ] down but he was DM and several people just saying that I was dis AR be discharged I was kicked out of the SEAL Teams I refused to go to combat um he just went on and on and on and so this guy was taking screenshots of what of what this guy was saying and sending them to us and so at this time now we have a lawyer and so we're were getting all this [ __ ] dude and then he had a YouTube site setup that he took down just trying to literally ruin who I was and I looked at all this [ __ ] and I studied them I was like man you got and what came out later on was he did have some demons he does have some Demons of course he does serious demons that's how insane it is that the guy deployed with you SEAL Team Six and these [ __ ] supposed to be bass [ __ ] see this is this is some of the issues I had when I was in is that when you work so hard man I put these [ __ ] like I talked about last time I was on this [ __ ] [ __ ] on a pedestal half the reason I ran on broken legs half the reason why I [ __ ] became who I became was because of the the image these guys had on me I was so impressed with the books and the [ __ ] and the and the and the people that they were I was like my God man I got to be a [ __ ] God I got to be a god mentally to [ __ ] get in here and once I got in I discovered something different I'm not saying that I'm not saying everybody I'm not I don't know everybody in the seel teams but I had a problem with the fact that a lot of people lived this this [ __ ] like a lot of the civilians like oh my God the seals are this the seals are that you were able to run badwater 135 because you're a Navy SEAL and because they like no [ __ ] that ain't why and I always knew the [ __ ] and I had issues with it man I had issues with it so I had a [ __ ] I had issues with it a lot of people didn't like that and then I went on to go and recruiting for a little bit and then the heart surgeries happened so the more I was in recruiting the more I was that [ __ ] happened they just started slowly building up lies slowly building up lies and I came out to I was I told Jennifer I and I knew it I said standby stand by it's coming whenever you're a person that gets what other people think is attention that they think they deserve yes sir that's when things get weird oh yeah that's why they bring those [ __ ] deployments because they think oh my God you didn't deploy as much as me you didn't deploy as much as me he was this he's not known for being for for deploying and [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] don't care yeah I have I have a combat deployment and I deployed another time that we were supposed to it was right during 9/11 we were supposed to go and they [ __ ] had us over in Guam we were all pissed off didn't work out that way but I got over there and what's funny about it this is this is what makes me laugh so much there's a lot of Navy C who never deployed over combat ever ever and it makes me laugh because [ __ ] want to act like one combat deployment where I fought for my [ __ ] country it's [ __ ] think about that fought from my [ __ ] country did my [ __ ] sorry it worked out the way it worked out and that's that's a that's not enough I think it part part of the problem with some of those guys is when guys are seriously Alpha and they think they go above and beyond and they push harder than anybody and then they meet you and you're the guy that's getting up at 3:30 in the morning yelling at them while you're running like I know you're sleeping I know you're still in bed [ __ ] I'm out here running 10 miles before you eat breakfast that's half the reason I did it yeah that's half the reason that [ __ ] going to [ __ ] halisco and [ __ ] getting waffle breakfast and [ __ ] bacing and eggs [ __ ] that bothered me I said [ __ ] I got my family and everybody thinking I'm some [ __ ] stud and you all just got to [ __ ] lift some weights y'all don't want to [ __ ] like I said I was in charge of PT and they're like Noah this ain't buzz goggin like man you got a lot of [ __ ] food this ain't everybody I don't know every seal I don't know every seal but you want to run your [ __ ] mouth about me and talk your little [ __ ] I got my secrets too and I won't say names cuz only a [ __ ] does that so keep on running your [ __ ] mouths I know all you [ __ ] so you started taking over PT yeah I was so when I got back so I went on my first deployment and when I came back off my first deployment I begged put seven chits in seven chits it's like a request chit to go to Ranger school [ __ ] don't request to go to Ranger school I wanted to go to Ranger school as a seal you went through buds whatever the [ __ ] you don't want to go to another course to get your ass kicked I did I did so much Ranger school came back honor man I was the enlisted honor man at Ranger school but they say I'm a bad operator they also say I'm a bad operator but guess what they had my black ass when I was [ __ ] in Iraq I was chared it's called PSD okay so you're like a bodyguard I'm a bad operator Joe but guess where I was I was the lead Navigator so I'm the eyes so everything we did was in the car it was my job to make sure that whole [ __ ] platoon was safe okay you're not going to put a dumb bad operator up there who's [ __ ] not good it's my job to make sure I called all the outs called all the trouble coming had to get us there safe we had the [ __ ] guy who was going for the prime minister's job who we a garden and they had a bad operator what they want to call me they want to say the little [ __ ] rumors I was the guy who let it and it was so good I did such a good job that there's two of us cuz the job's very stressful being a primary Navigator stressful so they have a primary and a secondary so some days I would do it some days another guy would do it I was doing such a good job Joe that they didn't want the other guy to do it so I became the only guy navigating us through [ __ ] Iraq all right and our guy didn't live in the green zone the green zone is a safe place our guy lived in the red zone so we had to go out in the Red Zone every day to get this [ __ ] guy bring it back in no there was no shoot him UPS cuz this one one rumor that was out there that came out from this guy was I froze I froze in a firefight it's kind of funny how you can freeze in a firefight when oure was never in morning so it's just just [ __ ] man but I know where it comes from I know where it comes from crabs in a bucket I know where it comes from my friend it's just crabs in a bucket that's it sorry sorry I became so successful guys that's what it is people don't like it when you did the same thing they did you come from the same fraternity but you get exort exorbitant amounts of attention and success oh yeah and instead of looking at that and going wow look what he did that's amazing I wish I did that or maybe I could do more or he's inspiring other people and that's great you know what though I will say this there's a there's a lot of them that do say that that's great there's a lot of them that do say this I have a guy named Hawk you know that that email I sent to you a while ago about this guy who wrote that email about the SEAL Teams and I shared it with you you about he's talking about like only 133% of you actually it's like anyway I sent email remember so anyway he's a guy that sent that email Hawk he's like my best friend so he uh bad [ __ ] when he when he got out of SE teams he wrote this email and sent out to like every Navy SE and it was like 87% of you [ __ ] he said 87% of you [ __ ] you know are are living off of one week and what he was talking about was hell week like that one week in hell week is all they're living off of cuz they're not living it now and he made these shirts called the 133% shirts and the other 133% guys are actually getting after it that [ __ ] sent me two of them all right he sent me two of them so yeah they're right I wish I could have deployed more and blah blah blah whatever and whatever man but I was I was a [ __ ] good seal and [ __ ] good teammate and some guys didn't like me and in the fraternity [ __ ] had it out and there's a time somebody [ __ ] did some [ __ ] but is what it is man you ever heard uh when people talk about some Union work one of the things that happens when you're in some unions is like if you're working too hard someone will come along go hey David slow the [ __ ] down Bad true statement like you're moving too many packages you're doing too much of this to too much of that you're setting the standard too high and you're [ __ ] it up for everybody else and so you'll have people that will sabotage someone mhm just because that person wants to work hard oh I see it but it made me grow it made me grow and I and I'm glad I didn't put a case on that guy and I'm glad I got a chance to study him and it is what it is man it is what it is and this is one part that I try to tell people and teach them if you're trying to go to that uncommon amongst the uncommon place it's a lonely [ __ ] up there man it's lonely I'm not saying I'm better than every [ __ ] body I'm not saying that and once again I'm not speaking for every seal I'm not but I just didn't I didn't try to be what they were what you're just saying is just a fact it's just a fact man it's just a fact and there there's people that are willing to go very far and then there's people that are willing to go far further than them that's it and when your person who prides yourself on your ability to go very far and then someone is willing to go far farther than you you have to decide do I want to look at that as the new standard do I want to judge myself do I want to admire him or do I want to try to take him down because I feel bad because I can't do what he does or haven't done what he does or what he does makes me look bad because I like to think I'm a hard worker I like to think I'm disciplined and hard and then I see this [ __ ] dude out there that just making me look soft right and so instead of just going look at him man [ __ ] yeah right instead of a smart person would look at that person as fuel but you have to make your own decisions too because you do requires a dedication that will eliminate a lot of things from your life that some people enjoy and think are important dude and also when you when I took the road cuz I knew what I was doing when you when you take that road and you just don't want to just fit in it's a lonely road it's a lonely road and you get a lot of haters man and like I tell people all the time man if I can walk on water [ __ ] would say because I couldn't swim tell that right the [ __ ] now yeah tell that right now and and this is a true statement I used to get so mad like I said about this [ __ ] [ __ ] man but I sat back one day I was like you know what all these people hating on me man like I have a guy who's trying to who's trying to write a book saying that I was telling people he's a famous author like I'll never drop names dude I'm not trying to hurt your business but you're funny these people are funny keep on talking your [ __ ] I will absorb it and make a mixtape out of your [ __ ] ass like I do he tried to tell he he was going to write book that I was telling people to run until your kidneys got [ __ ] up that my mentality of running is is I was telling people I was telling people to run into your kidneys got [ __ ] up to run until you get wbed up run until you get wbed up that's he was going to he's going to write a book and the premise was the way I think compared to the way he thinks I never told a [ __ ] in my life I tell you to do better and go as far as you can I don't tell you to go until you [ __ ] kill yourself until you get rabo but I will tell you this Joe you will never never in life meet a hater doing better than you that's a fact ever so when I [ __ ] realize that and Jennifer gets so mad at the lies she hears and this and that because it comes all through they spew it yeah I told Jennifer that [ __ ] man stop yeah [ __ ] calm down bro don't stop sending me that [ __ ] 100% factual there's there we were we were talking about in the bathroom earlier I was like you got a amount of bandwidth in your mind yep whatever that those units are let called a hundred hundred of of those things in your mind the moment you start entertaining haters you start reading comments you're stealing your bandwidth that you could apply to your loved ones that you could apply to the thing that you love to do that you could apply to making your life better you're stealing from yourself when you pay attention like I was talking about clearing that space out yeah and that space allows you to make more room for what's important in your life yeah if your mind's still clutter man you can't do [ __ ] there's also a thing about you being a public person being a public person now you have access to way more haters than the the average the average person knows a few haters maybe if you're a good-look woman and you got some [ __ ] in the office like to talk [ __ ] about you or if you're a guy who's like you know getting after it early and being disciplined and you you you make people intimidated by your ambition you're going to have some haters you're going to be people lying about you there's going to be but you have no idea what it's like to be a public person like yourself and the kind of haters that you must experience because if you paid attention to them all day long you would have no time for anything else no I never get in 2013 when I was first you know Jennifer knows about this [ __ ] I cussed everybody we had this [ __ ] round table and every was like man he have such a great story you need to tell it you need to get on social media and blah blah blah I cussed everybody out [ __ ] you I'm not [ __ ] going on that [ __ ] [ __ ] that's a bunch of [ __ ] [ __ ] lying it's it's the devil and the second I [ __ ] got on that [ __ ] dude it is the [ __ ] devil Instagram and social media man I had this [ __ ] kid man who [ __ ] literally the reason I talk about haters so much is this little boy his parents reached out to me and he was getting so much hate at school and we get so many emails I can't check them all and but I get to them but later on much like two or three months later so this guy wrote us and this kid was having a hard time with bullies and when I got to his email I got to it called his family up said hey what's going on you know David Gaga they were all happy to hear it he had killed himself so like I in the back of my [ __ ] mind and what hurt me the most was when I read the [ __ ] email and uh Oho [ __ ] I get my [ __ ] together I wasn't gonna bring this [ __ ] up I I I I read the email and they said he can you know you can help her son know our son really admires you that's why I um I'm so I'm I'm I'm I'm very vocal for a lot of reasons but I have to be strong because I know a lot of people aren't so you know that's why don't cower from [ __ ] you know at all you want to [ __ ] you know I've I'll take on whatever whatever challenge is in front of me I take it on because a lot of people don't have that that courage and it's hard to be brave it's [ __ ] hard to speak up for what you believe in and they they wrote this great email to me and they want me to talk to their son son was a big follower of mine and he uh so I called he's like yeah and it was a silent a very silent um pause and they told me what happened and um he hung himself and I was like it was [ __ ] up so you know that's why another reason I hate I hate being a public figure because it's not a public figure that I am like it's funny um I hang around some people who are real public figures you know like celebrities and I have people coming to me first like I'm talking of famous [ __ ] and people come to me me first and and they want to share their story in their life with me about how they changed and that's a massive responsibility that people don't understand like um when they come to you and they share the demons that they've gone through and and the hard [ __ ] the hardships that they've gone through and um and they say you and your book and and what you've done and your social media page that's why I make sure I want to go at people so hard Joe sometimes man for [ __ ] talking their [ __ ] to me man and lying [ __ ] I make sure that my social media only has like let's let's [ __ ] get it today let's [ __ ] let's [ __ ] get they go man why don't you follow anybody man I'm not into that [ __ ] dude I I I want you [ __ ] to understand dude I'm your biggest [ __ ] for for you who don't who aren't bitching and whining and complaining I'm your biggest [ __ ] cheerleader I want to see you do great I I want to see do great and a lot of that [ __ ] comes from that [ __ ] email from that kid who killed himself that I got to like two or three months too late and that [ __ ] [ __ ] every day I [ __ ] wake up I'm like [ __ ] man [ __ ] I gotta be honest I gota be right I gota be better and that's that's when you know that when when you're trying to do your best your life sucks and people don't get that when you're trying to have the best character when you're trying not to [ __ ] lie and you're trying not to [ __ ] put people down and you're trying to live you're trying to set the standard when you're trying to be the standard and that standard is I you know there's so much going wrong and going off in this world that if people can focus on themselves being better versus throwing hate and [ __ ] all this [ __ ] that happens out there and people talking [ __ ] running that's why I won't mention no [ __ ] names not trying to hurt you man but I'm trying to be the standard and sometimes life is just not fun when you're like can't do that can't say that gota watch out for that yeah I I gotta wake up today I gotta I gotta grind because there may be a [ __ ] out there that sees me in their [ __ ] car that says all right I'm going to go home and be better today so all these things are in my [ __ ] mind every [ __ ] day I wake up every [ __ ] day and I you know so you know I try to get to emails I it's it's me and Jennifer and but yeah you know people [ __ ] it's it's crazy man people come to me tell me their stories man it's [ __ ] very humbling that this kid that came from [ __ ] nothing is now helping people who you know like you know know it's is funny and people call me crazy a lot man you're so [ __ ] crazy but what you do I look at him straight in the eye and I say man I'm not crazy I'm just not you I'm just not who you are who you want to be I have a responsibility man and I gotta [ __ ] take that seriously well people like to look at people that are pushing further than them and harder than them like there's something wrong with you yep you must be crazy got be crazy gota be crazy I love crazy though my favorite people are crazy yes you know but I don't I don't look at it as a negative I look at it as a strength it is I I see a person who's willing to go to that dark matter place I go oh I like that oh yeah I like that but you went there during sober October man you went there you went there so how' that feel man when you [ __ ] were going into those Journeys into those compartments well what I like about it is that you had to do it every day you know and so I just every day would you know know it was coming go hey all right here we go time to get going and every day just get after it in some crazy way one of my favorite things is the thing that I hate the most it's airdine Sprints I do those Tabata sprints on the airdine machine oh the [ __ ] Echo Bike yeah the Echo Bike from Rogue 20 second Sprints 10 second rest 20 second do cycles of eight so eight rounds of that and then I would do another one and another one and another one I was doing an hour at that that's [ __ ] brutal so hard but it but when it was done I'm standing in a puddle I'm completely drenched but that feeling of getting through this cu the last Cycles when you're doing like and you look like cuz the Rogue bike will show you like you've done three which means you have to you have to do five more of these Sprints and that 10 seconds just non-existent she like and then tekken's like it's it's so quick and then you're back at it again those last ones are so hard but when you get through it the rest of the day is so much better that's like fight training man because the month of November all I've been doing is drinking really oh man I've been working out still working out but we're doing a lot of drinking and I'm like this I got to stop so I woke up today because today's December 1st I'm like I'm not drinking this month I'll have a glass of wine on Christmas or something like that but this month I'm back to the Grind are you cuz yeah yeah cuz I enjoyed October this suck when it's over it's life is better well you know you just got to get through the suck that's right and then life is better but the thing that gets me is the level of I don't give a [ __ ] and anxi the less the the lack of anxiety that comes after you work out every day is so worth the workout you're so calm so calm the only thing that changes your [ __ ] DNA is discipline yes dis the only thing that changes your DNA man is the only thing only thing man you could be [ __ ] so [ __ ] up and I realized that man I was like man the only thing that changeed my DNA is discipline know what I'm saying I've Incorporated a new thing that I was telling you where I get up first thing in the morning I get in the cold plunge cuz I was doing the cold plunge after I did the sauna and it's a little easier cuz the sauna sucks right but you know when that 20 minutes is up or 25 minutes is up and then you get in that cold the cold sucks but it doesn't suck suck as much as when you're cold and then you get in the cold so when I wake up in the morning I don't dress warm I wear my [ __ ] underwear and I go outside and it's 40° this morning and I walk out and I lift the lid on that morosgo cold plunge and I see the [ __ ] ice floating up in there and every day I climb in that's brutal and I just get in there for 3 minutes in the morning and then I work out that's [ __ ] brutal because I read this thing um I'll send it to you Jamie but I read this thing where uh they've been doing studies on what happens to people Andrew huberman and I actually discussed this and huberman's a very interesting guy but um it's about the benefits of cold plunge before you actually work out really yeah cuz there's a benefit after you work out in terms of reduction of inflammation but what they're saying is you shouldn't do it right after you lift weights got it got it because then Muses yeah it it actually decreases the hypertrophy so you don't gain as much mass or gain as much strength but there's some benefit to doing it before you work out I think there's a a link involved in that too so anyway this is a guy uh who's talking about prostate specific antigen blood te test came back uh very high and everyone said that he had to get a biopsy and he said the story I've heard about old older men getting biopsies in prostate ectomies sounded like nightmares to him so he decided to try to manage his PSA with ketosis and Ice baths so it worked his PSA dropped from over seven to less than one and along the way a funny thing happened to his testosterone it went through the roof to 1140 which is crazy high his he said my urologist didn't believe me he thought I must be juicing so he had my luteinizing hor hormones tested 2 sure enough 8.9 is off the charts for a fat guy in his 50s he said then I did a research and I discovered a Japanese study from 1991 that showed the secret was exercising after your ice bath it's the opposite of what everybody says to do which is exactly how I got this far in the first place he said now I'm stuck with the tea levels of an oversex 19yearold I'm not complaining damn but so this is the thing that um people realizing now there's some extreme benefit to heavyduty S here this extreme benefit to heavy duty cold exposure right and then you force your body to heat up and then you work out there so so you know I'm trying that now and I've only done it three days in a row well how's it working it's working it's hard but the the the but part of it is just the the fact that you have to do it in the like I'm not giving myself any mornings off so I have that's how I start my day now whereas before I was working out so the workout I ease myself into the workout get on the bike warm up jump a little rope start the kettle bell routine do all the things you got to do but now it's just right into the suck so it's it's harder I tell you right now man the [ __ ] cold being in cold water cold ice water it literally is the one thing that makes you question everything when you're going through hard training and [ __ ] like that you know I've been through a lot of different training the military and that cold water it definitely many dreams die while suffering that should be a t-shirt many dreams die while suffering my friend that's so true I talk about it man like this this [ __ ] guys getting that water and you see their [ __ ] eyes roll back and I'm like oh yeah many dreams die while suffering friend yeah [ __ ] I was trying to talk to Jamie about it Jamie it's [ __ ] cold I'll do cold it's just like there's a level of cold I want to ease myself into it I don't want to just start in the worst that might be the best way to do it Jamie yeah that's what tell got jump in that I did I just I just couldn't go like below my knees yeah there man hey man once that pecker gets cold boy it's real I know I know yeah it's all real I go right up to the chin I want that water right there oh that's legit right there man if it's real legit you go under Hicks and Gracie he puts a snorkel on really yeah Hixon gets in that water for a couple minutes under the water with the snorkel on he likes that [ __ ] huh Hixon hixon's an intense [ __ ] So speaking of that who's the best ever oh the best ever in MMA ever an MMA it's hard to say there's a lot of candidates you know I've always said Mighty Mouse is one of my Best Bets CU he was so goddamn good and he's still so godamn good now but now he's fighting in one FC but he was a flyweight Champion for a long time and his he was the highest level of expression of mixed martial arts ability that I'd ever seen but he's also fighting guys that are much lighter they're 125 pounds you know everyone's very quick but he was just so skillful but then there's Jon Jones Jon Jones really never lost that's a nasty [ __ ] he's a nasty [ __ ] and you know really Jon Jones [ __ ] off you want to talk about a guy who just did it by talent and will Jon Jones beat Alexander Guston without training unbeli basically didn't train there's a few guys like that there's a guy named Ryan span who's out there right now who just [ __ ] up Dominic Reyes and Dominic Reyes was the one guy who took Jon Jones to the Limit Dominic Reyes uh went on a series of losses after that fight but he had this fight with Jon Jones and took Jon Jones to the [ __ ] limit and a lot of people thought he won that decision then he went on after that fight got got knocked out by Yan bovich who became the light heavyweight champion got knocked out by Yuri prasa and then just got lit up by Ryan span and Ryan span is this guy who's always been Ultra Ultra talented right but just was always afraid of running out of gas didn't train didn't really put in camps just had a lot of ability and a lot of technique right in his last fight he fought Dominic Reyes and he put in a full training camp for the first time ever and just [ __ ] Dominic Reyes up just lit him up like a Christmas tree in the first round and put him away so you're talking about a guy who beat you know many people's eyes should have won a decision against John Jones right and then Ryan span just takes him out in the first round easy quick because he finally worked hard well there's something about that full training camp man yes there's something about going out no phone yes up in the [ __ ] mountains away from civilization away from the bacon and eggs the silk sheets the [ __ ] five star resorts the [ __ ] everybody knowing you sign autographs and [ __ ] Dark Matter dude Dark Matter like a [ __ ] the further you [ __ ] drive out your house and start going up in that [ __ ] Mountain Man you start to that [ __ ] mind starts to click over man you get a full Camp up in some [ __ ] Dark Matter Place yep it's [ __ ] over bro there's a reason why so many guys would go up to Big Bear that's where genady Golovkin used to go up there can't Brea in that mother Ali used to go to the Poconos Ali or um Tyson rather would go to the cat skills a lot of guys would do that lot of evil up in them [ __ ] mountains boring cat skills it's also this nature oh yeah cuz like nature doesn't give a [ __ ] about you and there's something you realize when you're running a mountain and you know you see Eagles Fly nobody gives a [ __ ] about you up there no one there's no press no one's watching that's a beautiful thing man that's when you really know who you are yeah when you get up there there's no like the coach is probably back a little bit you got your little run by yourself and [ __ ] you figure out a lot you figure out a lot man you start to figure out lot of [ __ ] problems up there by yourself yeah so this I don't to answer your question I don't think there is a greatest ever because there's different weight classes you're right khabib definitely is in the conversation he's the only like really Elite guy to retire undefeated that's a nasty [ __ ] oh he was so good dude dud there's something about looking at that [ __ ] like I love these guys who you can look in their eyes you can tell something ain't right hard as Nails you can tell something's [ __ ] right something ain't right and that's in a good way right the way when he fought Conor McGregor and they were booing him at the weighs and he goes I'm going to smash your boy you should play that interview play that interview because when I'm talking to him and he they're all booing and CH it's like they're all Conor McGregor fans they flew in from Ireland I mean this is a big fight and he's like I'm gonna smash your boy alhamdulillah I'm going to smash your boy play this look at them booing him kib what does this fight mean to you to defend your title tomorrow it's so loud there that's why I'm scream it's so loud first of all I want to say alhamdulillah God gave me everything alhamdulillah I know you got this don't like this alhamdulillah tomorrow night I'm going to smash your boy guys I'm going to smash your boy and I want to say thank you all Irish fans you know all fans around the world because of you guys this fight is happened thank you guys and tomorrow night inshah and still thank you sir good luck to you the champion ladies and gentlemen thank you all tomorrow I'm going to smash your boy Jesus dud and that's what he did he was on top of him pounding him going let's talk now cuz Conor saying theight play that play that he's on top of him punching him in the face go let's talk let's now beating the [ __ ] out of him that's some Next Level fck now let's talk now and Conor was like look at we're talking let let's talk now let's talk let's talk now oh my God stop st hey stop stop Conor is saying it's only business and khabib says you tired let's talk Jesus dude he brought that [ __ ] to another level man yeah well he used that as fuel he took no [ __ ] mental Aid stations in the training camp no no no no he was a bad [ __ ] and then when his father died he told his mother he was going to fight one more time and that's it so he's in his prime still right now he's in his physical prime and he's like told his mom he's GNA he's done he's not coming back you don't think well his Protege is Islam ma makev who's now the new UFC lightweight champion and Islam is as good as him in that same realm w i mean remains to be seen whether or not Islam can have a Reign the way he did but he just beat Charles Oliva was one of the best ever and he just ran through him to win the title that's a bad dude too man ol is a bad [ __ ] and olera is an interesting case too because Ola used to be kind of a quitter yeah I know he kind of fell apart in many fights early in his career and then he had the birth of his daughter and then changed his [ __ ] entire life changed the way he fought changed his mentality changed his his discipline and his focus and then became this [ __ ] who just dominating everybody olera I believe he's 33 see find out with if that's accurate so are there some are there some old Fighters right now who are still kicking ass yes yam bovich um Glover toer just lost the light heavyweight title at 42 he won it at 42 and then lost it to Yuri brovka in a very very close fight yeah he's 33 olera is 33 you know what's funny about that man but I see these older guys who are still [ __ ] grinding hard people ask about father time yeah father time doesn't get you man it's father fatigue it's father fatigue man like I see these guys who have been in sports for a long time fighting or basketball football whatever it is yeah and it's that grind it's that everyday waking up grind it's not it's it's not father time man it's it's the fact that you know I got to go do it again yeah I got to do it again so a lot of these guys are fighting father fatigue and they're doing a good job of doing it I think there's many factors there's father fatigue there's father enthusiasm that's right but then there's also injuries there's you so many of these guys are fighting with [ __ ] up backs and [ __ ] up knees and [ __ ] up elbows and [ __ ] up hands and you don't know that when you see them because they look jacked they look ripped right in their head they know I got to be careful if I move to the side on my right side cuz my knee's [ __ ] I know all about that I got to be careful if I get kicked in the legs because this is [ __ ] I got to be yeah and there's a lot of guys that also been they taking too many shots and they can't take a punch anymore right that happens to guys and then you see they get dinged once and they get wobbly where so what the [ __ ] happens with that man I started seeing guys who [ __ ] been getting hit a lot yeah they can't take a hit anymore man like they'll [ __ ] go out quick lot of speculation and um one of the things they say is that they believe that at certain point in time your brain tries to protect you from the punishment and just shut off like that your your your body realizes like this dude is too strong mentally he's too tough and he'll just absorb shots and is just ruining our brain so when you get hit your brain is like check please wow and your brain will shut off and then the other that's a optimistic perspective got it the other less optimistic perspective is that you are destroying your mind and that your mind is simply not resilient anymore and you can't take a shot anymore because you've damaged all the connective tissue that's holding the [ __ ] brain in place and you've also created so much CTE and so much swelling and so that one shot can take you out there's also on top of that one of the big problems with MMA is the weight cutting so the weight cutting is which what everybody does they they drain themselves 24 hours before the fight when in say oh he weighs 170 lbs like guys like kamaro Usman who's giant for 170 he's 170 for like 20 minutes how much does he weigh like walking the street 200 lb 200 lb easy so does he come back in the ring about 190 200 he's in the90s for sure yeah lean as [ __ ] shredded is a [ __ ] but dehydrated like hell to make 170 there's he's not ever really 170 wow he's 170 be like totally sucked up I mean also cramping you know it's terrible to do that 24 hours before you have a cage fight is so crazy [ __ ] up so those take a toll so if you're 35 37 39 all these guys that have been doing that their whole life every time you cut that weight it takes a little chip off the old block every time every time it takes it's another chop into the tree trunk got it just your foundation and it's just little minor things every training camp you go through you know can you do another one you know your back is [ __ ] up you get out of bed like this like it's like little micro injuries that are constantly piling up you know we were talking about hickon Gracie earlier Hixon can can't really even roll hard anymore he's in the 60s and he's got these injuries all over his back is all [ __ ] up it's like all those years of Jiu-Jitsu that Gracie shit's no joke though M them [ __ ] that family they change the world the world this little 160 lb [ __ ] man this little [ __ ] can't even see him under some of these fat [ __ ] this [ __ ] finger finger [ __ ] locking you out man [ __ ] get you in a pinky lock bro like where is he tapping from why is he tapping I can't even see you know Gracie got [ __ ] a pinky loot this [ __ ] was nasty dude T they taught the world Jiu-Jitsu the world didn't know Jiu-Jitsu is the only martial art that people had ever experienced that did what was advertised right what was advertised was that a small skillful person could beat a larger stronger opponent who didn't know the techniques well he proved it he proved it boy Gracie proved it in the UFC and he changed martial arts forever and that that family's probably the most consequential the most important significant family in the history of martial arts the Gracie family changed martial arts worldwide it's funny man about you know there's so many people out here who uh who are very successful and they talk about I mean Super money great familyship they talk about that that they're missing something that there's something in their life that they're missing and they and they talk to me about that [ __ ] and I mentioned the Gracies it seemed like they they had this it was about money it was about nothing man they're like Grassroots [ __ ] and that's what I always tell people that they're missing that they're missing that desire like those guys had a passion and a [ __ ] obsess that's the word Obsession Obsession and I guarantee you man those [ __ ] don't have those conversations I feel like I'm missing something right they're not they're not missing [ __ ] dude no no they they they got it figured out man well Hixon in particular cuz Hixon was Ho's older brother who was everybody says is the greatest of all time really from that era yeah he was there was never been a time other than today there's a time right now with Gordon Ryan which is very rare it's very rare where someone comes along and everybody says this is the baddest [ __ ] alive no if ANS or questions about and back then when Hixon was in his prime you ask any black belt anywhere in the world they're like hixon's the man hixon's the man and he was a yogi he all this crazy breath work that he would do he figured out the physical as well as the mental far beyond where everybody else was willing to track travel and there's a great documentary people are interested in Hickson Gracie called choke hixon's been on the podcast a couple of times but there's a great documentary called choke that followed him when he was in his prime in the 1990s competing in Japan and uh one of the things he does in that documentary he gets in a frozen glacial River and he just sits down and he's meditating In this River up to his neck of this [ __ ] 30 Dee water just washing over him and he's just be Talent bro he's like thank you my Lord thank you my Lord and he's just like just taking it all in it's beyond Talent that's badass there there's so much involved there's Talent there's discipline there's the Mind focus and there's also the Brilliance of his ability to interpret and understand technique right there was so many things that's badass and this is the the case with Gordon Ryan today who's arguably the greatest of all time and Gordon is a lot bigger than everybody that was you know like Hixon was at his prime was about 200 lbs Gordon's like 240 and you know Gordon is utilizing modern training methods and 365 days a year he trains doesn't take any days off this is Hixon in the the Frozen glacial River that's his brother hoer who's also one of the greats that that's that Gracie family man never been a family like never been a family like it in martial arts you just have like never will be Army of killers that's it yeah I mean look at him snorkel yep that's what he likes to do is to get under that water and he does that with a cold plunge too know what's what's crazy that so many people would never understand that kind of discipline or that kind of that kind of human being that wants to go to the stratosphere yeah they'll never they'll always be misunderstood man always you can't even that's why a lot of times when I talk to people I can't I can't have a conversation with a lot of people man because you're going to walk away like why do you do it David why don't you just take a break you deserve a break David take a nap that's it did you ever have a piece of pie why don't you put your feet up why rest a little you think one day you'll get fat that's it you should let yourself get fat dude you're being funny as [ __ ] B the truest of all [ __ ] statements oh yeah dude I don't do nearly as much as you and I get it dude right I'm like you you would never understand that's why we'll never talk yeah you'll never get it so that's why I don't have conversations with people man those are brutal conversations with people that like what I don't understand what your motivation is what what are you chasing I haven't been on a podcast years you insecure where you running from where you running from David where you going you know you get there faster in a car in the car oh I get that a lot that's the one I get a lot I get that a lot and and they're joking I'm like and I don't find this [ __ ] funny like you [ __ ] man it's so dumb it's dumb as [ __ ] man but whenever you some someone who's that wild and that far beyond where most people are willing to go you're going to you're going to run into normies well it's like [ __ ] go into the circle breaker man and they go in there and start rewiring their brain they go in and say like like like that [ __ ] right there with the snorkel and [ __ ] yeah oh no man I got to put this over here yeah this circuit needs to be there that needs to be there you're totally rewiring how the whole brain works to not to not feel sorry for yourself to ignore pain to ignore discomfort to push your place you know to push your mind place that people don't even [ __ ] want to talk about they can't fathom and it's what you talk about with knowledge yep that's what it is this knowledge it's understanding of those feelings that's it and the only way you understand that those feelings are rare they don't come up all the time all day long you wouldn't be able to deal with them right so most people don't know what to do with those feelings they're not around them enough but you're around them constantly right Hixon was around them constantly it's like get in those things then you learn about them you get a map of the territory that's it you get a blueprint yeah and the second day surface when you're [ __ ] getting choked out I've seen so many see I love watching fights man cuz I I see them and I start to see okay you're in a bad situation man and I see a couple guys getting ready to [ __ ] tap yeah and that one second decision I call it they're thinking man I got to tap it's like and and and and and you see the hand motion like I'm about to tap and it go somewhere else not today [ __ ] yeah cuz I've been here I've been here before I can laugh maybe this one more second and this one second may get me out of this [ __ ] and I see how the how the mind is evolving in that one moment that one quick moment I see that a million thoughts went through their [ __ ] mind and it didn't tap I'm going show you an example of that Brian Ortega versus Alexander volkanovski Alexander volkanovski almost gets Tapped Out volkanovski is the next guy to fight Islam makev and Islam makev is khabib's protege that's a bad boy Alexander volkanovski is the 145 pound champion he's going up to 155 to try to fight makev and win the title at that weight so he fights this guy Brian Ortega who is a student of hon and Henry Gracie got it so he's an elite Black Belt and he gets Brian Ortega gets vulcanos in this Guillotine choke mounted Guillotine choke which is the nastiest [ __ ] ever and this guy is a [ __ ] strangulation expert and V Kowski is stuck give me some volume give me some volume here oh my goodness he might go to sleep here's his mind the is and he got out see and he got out he was so close you hear Paul Paul Felder saying he might go to sleep so he almost catches him here now in a Dar and volovski winds up on top he gets on top he just starts Hammer hammering them I mean this fight is one of the best examples you want to watch this fight you want to talk about Will and Warrior spirit this is one of the best fights ever for both guys cuz Orga like going into the fourth round you're like how is this [ __ ] surviving and then he comes out in the fifth round guns guns blazing see Bol these guys just drained the [ __ ] gas tank in this fight it was an amazing amazing amazing fight now what he should have did after that he should have gone home and wrote that [ __ ] out cuz in that moment if he could even think about it the knowledge he gained in that moment Priceless where what was happening when you almost tapped what was and I'm not talking about this surface conversation that's beautiful to me that I I study that [ __ ] so much you were in a horrible situation I know you were like I gotta tap I got to tap I gotta tap but if you break that down really break it down to the smallest molecule possible your mind went through so so many things that allowed you to not tap you got to study that man that right there is so much that's that's beautiful yeah that's that that's Beauty right there at work Beauty at work it is because for that man I mean vulcanos he walked out of there with his [ __ ] belt with the victory the cheers the Roars The Crowd Goes back home he [ __ ] did it it's amazing but he almost didn't I see he got to the door of death see it's that one second decision that one second decision I talk about this [ __ ] right here you get there and you want to quit and you don't yeah and you end up [ __ ] getting through it man well that's the thing is like your book can give people if even if they don't get a map of the territory they're getting directions right you want to go to I95 go about 10 miles down when you see Woodland Hills Road take a right you're giving them you're mind not be giving them a map cuz I think the map has to be acquired personally 100% well you're giving them Direction that's it you're saying this is how I got through this is how I developed my map MH people want to hand it to me I can't hand it to you you can't but you can give them something and I when I texted you I was in the middle of the book I was like I can run through a [ __ ] wall right now cuz that's what it feels like I love that there's something about the way you describe things and the way you're so honest and so personal about it especially the audio version of it and then when you do the podcast so the way the audio the audio is a special treat because it's the book and then with each individual chapter you have a small podcast where you and your co-writer break down what what what it was like for you and what was happening and and what what you were feeling and what you and it allows you to do it in an unscripted way so you could really and you're so honest about it it just it just gives you an understanding of that you this discomfort is UN avoidable right and then trying to avoid discomfort just brings you more discomfort and you don't realize it it just brings you this longterm dull discomfort as opposed to the Searing pain of like mid struggle discomfort which is what everybody's trying to avoid but you're still going to get discomfort you're just going to get this I could have should have would have been discomfort which is maybe worse you're right it might be worse it just makes it a little easier that's all that's all the repetitions do man it's not it doesn't take away the pain doesn't take away the suffering no you just studied it you know it you know how it feels yeah you know when to breathe when not to breathe you know all these different things you've been there you visited you've you you've lived there for a long period of time and that's why I like this book so much is because can't hurt me was like a bachelor's degree it was like the surface level of David gogins and some things that can help you out this to me is a master's degree this book right here takes you to another level of of the mind and how you think that's why I say this ain't no [ __ ] self-help book this is what the [ __ ] are you doing with your life book yeah and that's why that's so important what are you doing with your life man why are you sitting around why are you waiting for [ __ ] to happen it ain't going to happen like that why are you feeling sorry for yourself why you waiting for that [ __ ] apology that's never going to [ __ ] come people sit around waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and blaming and blaming and they're waiting with a hand out yeah Co happened and everybody's hands out now hands out and you see how it changed sort of the tone of the country it did and it made people feel entitled like someone deserve they deserve something yep that's right you don't deserve [ __ ] you don't deserve [ __ ] and that's the one thing that I knew and I found out the worst part if they give you [ __ ] you're going to be even more miserable oh that's a true statement isn't it a true statement a true statement everybody wants the government to come along and help them that's true statement someone to come along and give you things I should get things you should redistribute wealth you're not going to be happy NOP you're not you got to go get it no you're you're going to always wonder W I have all this [ __ ] money why do I feel like I said I feel like I'm missing something right because you didn't go out and achieve it on your own it's like a man who inherited money that's it they're always missing something big time there's something wrong with them someone gift wrapped you some [ __ ] yeah and now you're just a [ __ ] now you're like a half a man that's it you look like a man but you're like one of them Easter Bunny candy things you know those those chocolate Easter Bunnies that's it you like you try to bite into it your [ __ ] sh has to [ __ ] them shits up now three hundo yeah well I loved them when they were solid when you got a solid one oh look at a Sol lot more calories lot more snacks in that [ __ ] yeah that's a solid Easter Bunny but when you bite into one it just just destroy a [ __ ] up your teeth [ __ ] this is a [ __ ] Hollow one yes sir yeah a lot of people are Hollow Easter Bunnies a lot of people are hollow inside too yeah but you don't have to be no this is the beautiful thing of your story is that you started out [ __ ] up and sad and couldn't do anything and you transformed yourself so people don't think like this guy's just always been hard from the cradle to bra like you you you turned yourself into this which is the real that's the that's the story that gives people hope you can truly develop otherworldly discipline right it's possible to develop other worldly mental strength well we change everything we change our car we change our house sometimes we change our wife or husband we change the underwear we change everything in our lives change our hair change how we look change everything but very few of us change how we think and that's the one problem with with a lot of people they're not willing to change how they think you're not going to evolve if you continue thinking the same [ __ ] way so a lot of people have a problem with that so I'm always trying to evolve in some way I'm never wearing the same underwear every day always changing that [ __ ] never finished it's out right now ladies and gentlemen I can't recommend it enough it's a [ __ ] fantastic book as good if not better than can hurt me you're the man brother appreciate you very much thank you Joe all right bye everybody [Music] [Applause] [Music]
