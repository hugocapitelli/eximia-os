[01:46] episode welcome everyone back to the
[01:47] school of greatness podcast we have the
[01:49] inspiring David gogin in the house good
[01:51] to see you man thank you very excited
[01:53] about this I first heard about you
[01:55] through Jesse isler's book uh living
[01:57] with a seal and he came on to talk about
[02:01] his experience and he actually didn't
[02:02] mention your name because you didn't
[02:04] want to be known right a few years ago
[02:06] right but now you're wanting to be known
[02:08] and you're putting your message out
[02:10] everywhere right and I'm just curious
[02:12] quickly why did you want to not be known
[02:14] then but now you do want to have your
[02:16] message out there well when Jesse wrote
[02:18] that book living with the seal I was uh
[02:21] I was about two or three weeks from
[02:25] getting out of the military so you know
[02:27] being a seal you know I didn't want to
[02:29] be mention David gogin in this book so
[02:32] the second the book popped I was
[02:33] retiring so the book came out November
[02:35] 15th or November 1
[02:37] 2015 and I uh retired November 2015 Goa
[02:43] so that's why that's the that's the
[02:45] biggest reason why and when did you
[02:46] start putting yourself out there doing
[02:47] interviews and talking about your
[02:49] message and you got on social media and
[02:51] started sharing videos when when did you
[02:53] decide to do that well I've been talking
[02:55] to people for several years and I wasn't
[02:58] really big on like my mindset is very
[03:00] different than most people yeah it's a
[03:02] mindset of
[03:03] um I don't want to be known too much I
[03:06] don't want too many looky lose in my
[03:08] life because that's where I gain my
[03:11] strength I gain my strength from a place
[03:12] of
[03:14] quiet and the more I got my story out
[03:17] there the more I realize it no longer be
[03:20] David Goggins The Quiet Man it'd be
[03:23] David Goggins the guy that's on
[03:24] Instagram answering this answering that
[03:27] cuz I'm also a guy that's always about
[03:29] is someone reaches out to me I'm not
[03:31] going to sit back and say oh you know
[03:32] whatever I'm going to reach back to you
[03:34] so it's going to take time out of me
[03:36] trying to gain strength and me trying to
[03:37] get where I need to go so that was a big
[03:39] deterrent for me to get on Instagram and
[03:41] all stuff I'm not I'm not big on social
[03:43] media anyway yeah but then I realized
[03:45] that I have a very God put me in a very
[03:49] interesting spot of life where he made
[03:53] hell my teacher he made hell my teacher
[03:58] and a lot of people don't understand
[04:00] that so I'm trying to give people a
[04:03] different thought process of life where
[04:07] failure hell disappointment
[04:10] discomfort is a great learning tool and
[04:14] many people don't understand that and a
[04:17] lot of people won't won't even
[04:18] understand this interview when we get
[04:19] done with it but it's these few moments
[04:22] in life that you have like for me I
[04:24] always talk about it Rocky one round
[04:27] 14 that one too many minute and 13
[04:31] second clip
[04:33] of Rocky getting up when Apollo knocked
[04:37] him down that one clip when I was going
[04:40] through a very bad time in my life I
[04:43] saw what I wanted to be and it wasn't a
[04:47] guy that won it wasn't a guy that won
[04:49] everything he did it was a guy that kept
[04:52] getting up after being knocked down so I
[04:55] realized if that two minutes and 13
[04:57] seconds changed my life so I was I saw
[05:01] something that I needed to be in the
[05:03] world I was living
[05:04] in maybe my
[05:07] story will give someone the two minutes
[05:09] and 13 seconds they need to change their
[05:12] life millions of people live in a very
[05:14] comfortable place that's fine don't
[05:16] listen to
[05:17] me a lot of people are looking for that
[05:20] 2 minutes and 13 seconds and I might be
[05:23] that person that's why I started sharing
[05:24] it yeah you talked about in the very
[05:26] beginning I like this um
[05:31] what did you say here your job is to be
[05:33] the best of your ability this will hurt
[05:35] the mission is not about making yourself
[05:36] feel better the mission is about being
[05:39] better and having a greater impact in
[05:40] the world and it sounds like you
[05:43] understanding the fact that you need to
[05:44] put yourself out there a little bit more
[05:46] right is going to reach more people and
[05:48] impact more people as opposed to always
[05:50] being quiet right is that what I'm
[05:51] hearing exactly I I I had to find a
[05:53] happy medium yeah you know I had to find
[05:56] a happy medium because what's the point
[05:58] like we all have a story
[06:00] and I believe that we're all we're all
[06:03] teachers we're all teachers and if you
[06:06] don't learn
[06:07] something and give back what like like
[06:11] like what you learned yeah what's the
[06:13] point of living you're wasting yeah
[06:14] you're wasting you you have all this
[06:15] knowledge of what you learn some people
[06:17] may think you're crazy some people may
[06:19] you know may put a title on you but it's
[06:22] it's it is you know it's it's those few
[06:24] people who are like you know what I need
[06:26] to hear that so you have to put yourself
[06:28] out there so was there Awakening for you
[06:30] in the last few years that said okay I'm
[06:32] not I'm not doing this enough I'm
[06:34] putting myself out there I'm not telling
[06:36] my story I'm I'm wasting certain aspects
[06:38] of My Life by not giving that message
[06:41] out there were a lot of emails that came
[06:43] in to me and I didn't realize you know
[06:47] when you live your life you don't know
[06:49] what it's doing to people cuz it's my
[06:51] life I didn't know my life was as bad as
[06:54] it was because it's my life it's what I
[06:56] went through I think it's like the norm
[06:58] it's the norm yeah that's what I did man
[07:00] but when I started getting these emails
[07:01] from people saying hey you know what you
[07:03] changed my life that part changed my
[07:06] life that part of your story changed my
[07:07] life and because I have so many
[07:09] different parts of my life that so many
[07:12] people resonate with different spots
[07:15] maybe it's the obese part maybe it's the
[07:17] bullying part maybe it's the learn
[07:18] disability part maybe it's the abusive
[07:20] parent part whatever it may be right so
[07:23] many people draw from my story and I
[07:26] started getting these emails and I was
[07:27] like God man you know
[07:30] and I'm a big believer in something more
[07:31] powerful than me I don't know what it is
[07:34] but I'm not the end all so I was like uh
[07:38] I got to start doing more if I'm
[07:40] touching these people's lives a few
[07:42] people here and there right maybe I need
[07:45] to go out here and do some more it's
[07:46] crazy story man I mean if you guys um
[07:49] haven't gotten the book you guys can
[07:50] pre-order the book this is actually a
[07:52] galley copy here printed out uh make
[07:54] sure you guys check this out can't hurt
[07:56] me master your mind and defy the odds
[07:58] and I was when I was read reading the
[08:00] the uh the first part of the book about
[08:01] your childhood I mean your father just
[08:03] seemed like was just so abusive
[08:05] physically I mean it's one thing to be
[08:07] emotionally abusive and another thing to
[08:09] be physically and when you have both
[08:11] it's like the perfect storm of like the
[08:13] makings for chaos in your life right and
[08:16] it just sounded like he was just nasty
[08:19] nasty and everything was your fault and
[08:21] you were always wrong and you weren't
[08:23] living up to a standard both you and
[08:24] your brother and your mom right and it
[08:26] was just constant physical abuse over
[08:28] and over I mean the story you just being
[08:30] bent over and him just like whipping you
[08:31] over and over and you just gasping for
[08:33] air I was just like oh my gosh this is
[08:35] crazy right um how did you deal with
[08:37] that how did you like overcome the
[08:40] constant physical and emotional abuse
[08:43] you know what it's all I knew mhm so
[08:47] when you're born to that it's all you
[08:49] know you I mean you know something's not
[08:52] right because in my mind at a young kid
[08:54] I could tell man you know the way I was
[08:56] processing things wasn't right right I
[08:59] mean I suffer from severe toxic stress
[09:02] and that was one of the big reasons why
[09:05] I started you know I had to learn
[09:06] disability my focus in life was way off
[09:09] I was afraid I was afraid of everything
[09:13] and when you have that kind of
[09:15] foundation um growing up and that's
[09:18] where you start life at is being beat
[09:21] being abused and also working all nights
[09:23] at a skating rink not going to school
[09:26] and you have a guy who's an alcoholic
[09:28] and the second he got drunk he got mad
[09:32] and so our house lived in fear yeah and
[09:35] the one thing that you can't ever get
[09:37] out of a kid's mind is your mom's mind
[09:41] like like your mom's face the terror of
[09:44] the terror of your mom's so you know you
[09:47] know I didn't care about my brother I
[09:48] didn't care about me but I saw this
[09:51] woman go from Mary Poppins the sweetest
[09:55] person on the planet Earth and when you
[09:58] see your mom
[09:59] start to transform to a shell to a
[10:03] person whose face becomes stoic a person
[10:06] who has no emotion and that changes a
[10:09] kid yeah and when you're young and you
[10:12] have to grow up so fast so about 8 years
[10:14] old my mind was of a of a 40 year olds
[10:17] at eight you know my family like life
[10:21] came at me and it makes your brain you
[10:24] know you know outside playing with kids
[10:26] you know you're trying to avoid getting
[10:28] beat you know you're avoiding all these
[10:30] things when you go home it's supposed to
[10:32] be safe right and you're getting beat
[10:34] again exactly and what's funny about
[10:36] that we lived in on on Paradise Road
[10:38] yeah lived on Paradise Road and it
[10:42] wasn't so Paradise it was anything but
[10:44] Paradise man you know once those doors
[10:45] shut yeah you know my dad gave everybody
[10:48] a different view of him he wore the nice
[10:50] tailor suits he smiled that's right your
[10:52] dad's amazing those doors shut man and
[10:55] the Devil Himself came out so it was it
[10:58] was it was rough and that's why my
[11:00] Foundation was so uh was so beaten down
[11:04] at at a young age so learning disability
[11:07] I grew up dyslexic so I can relate to
[11:08] that of just like constantly feeling
[11:11] stupid and insecure and you know I had a
[11:12] tutor my entire life horri till I finish
[11:15] college I had a tutor right second grade
[11:17] reading level when I was in eth grade it
[11:19] was just like a constant struggle
[11:21] emotionally and I took that outlet into
[11:24] sports and said I'm going to just train
[11:25] myself to be the best I can be in a
[11:27] place where I can learn something
[11:28] different
[11:29] right and pick up a different skill but
[11:31] with your with your learning disability
[11:33] with your dad beating you screaming at
[11:36] you emotionally challenging your mind
[11:38] with uh the racism you dealt with with
[11:41] um the different struggles you felt with
[11:44] bullies what was the CH the hardest
[11:47] obstacle to overcome
[11:48] from up until about 15 16 the hardest
[11:52] obstacle was
[11:53] myself I started realizing more and more
[11:56] and
[11:57] more that all these people were gone
[12:00] what was Haunting Me was me I can't
[12:04] control my dad I can't control the
[12:06] people calling me I can't control all
[12:09] these things but they were things that
[12:12] kept me down it started to become my
[12:15] reality my reality was what they made it
[12:17] out to be and I
[12:20] became the most important conversation
[12:22] you'll ever have with your life you know
[12:24] in your life is when you have yourself
[12:26] and my conversation was absolutely
[12:28] horrifying what were you saying to
[12:29] yourself I'm dumb I'm nobody my dad I
[12:34] mean my dad was great in mental
[12:37] Warfare a drunk insecure
[12:40] man will make everybody around him feel
[12:43] like hell yeah because he wants to give
[12:46] you no power and that's why he was so
[12:49] mean and my mom and myself and my
[12:50] brother CU he didn't want anybody to get
[12:53] above himh he want to keep you down low
[12:56] so when you're growing up with all this
[12:58] stuff all this hate and it wasn't the
[13:01] beatings I could take the beatings all
[13:03] day it was a mental torture so when at a
[13:06] young age your your parents put a
[13:09] dialogue in you of
[13:10] confidence or you're nobody so that
[13:13] voice in my head was I'm a loser and
[13:16] then it was confirmed when I got in
[13:18] school and in third grade I was falling
[13:21] behind they want to put me in in a
[13:23] special school yeah you know with kids
[13:25] who can't learn right then it was
[13:27] confirmed what you know what my dad was
[13:29] saying so that confirmed it then I
[13:32] started cheating so I started realizing
[13:33] you know what I'm taking the easy way
[13:35] out again yeah and it started
[13:36] snowballing from there now now the kids
[13:38] are calling me
[13:39] NE but it wasn't all the kids so what
[13:42] happens is you start to get this picture
[13:45] that everybody hates you because your
[13:48] reality becomes so so big that you don't
[13:52] I mean you can't see the clear picture
[13:53] it might have been three or four kids
[13:55] doing it over and over right but it was
[13:56] the whole town everybody hated me so
[13:59] start the world hates me that's right
[14:01] yeah and that's when it that's when it
[14:03] became
[14:03] toxic and that is where I became my
[14:06] worst enemy wow so those are the
[14:08] conversations you those are the
[14:10] conversations when did you start to
[14:12] realize that those conversations weren't
[14:14] supporting your life I was a so my mom
[14:17] was getting ready to get
[14:19] married and this guy came into our Liv
[14:22] name was wilmouth he came into our lives
[14:25] and like I always say whenever my life's
[14:27] getting better God will put another
[14:30] challenge in front of me he gets
[14:32] murdered oh man and we move back to
[14:36] Brazil so so we moved from this town
[14:38] this small town in Brazil and we moved
[14:41] to Indianapolis
[14:42] Indiana a lot more blacks a lot more
[14:45] different colors yeah weren't you living
[14:47] in New York at some point too I was born
[14:49] in Buffalo New York right and I went
[14:50] from Buffalo to Indiana and then from me

[14:55] Indiapolis Indiana you know he got
[14:57] murdered when I was Indianapolis we went

[17:11] murdered so I didn't want to last thing
[17:13] on her mind she's like I've dealt with
[17:14] this my whole life right I didn't want
[17:16] to bother with anything man so I kept
[17:19] everything away from her so I'm in the
[17:21] crow wash trying to trying to scrub this
[17:23] stuff off and I got home and so happens
[17:25] two weeks later she gets a note from

[17:40] all this and all that and she was such
[17:42] in a bad spot in her life that the best
[17:46] thing she could do was like Hey you know
[17:48] you're you're going to
[17:49] fail you're going to fail School wow and
[17:54] I I was like my God man like you know
[17:56] she she was in a dark place and I was in
[17:59] a dark place and we were kind of on our
[18:01] owns in in the same house but living
[18:04] different lives and I realized that this
[18:06] time of my life she was a great mom but
[18:08] I was on my own and that's when a real
[18:11] big change happened for me so I said I'm
[18:12] going to join the military this a 6 17
[18:15] 17 you know I wanted to go into the uh
[18:17] delayed entry program MH and I went to
[18:20] take the asbab test and I
[18:22] cheated so that's what you knew that's
[18:24] what I did you're good so I got my
[18:26] friend cuz I walked to recruiter's
[18:29] office and recruiter says hey you got to
[18:30] take this ASVAB test second I heard test
[18:32] I was like man oh hang on a second I
[18:34] can't test this in my life man I'm going
[18:35] to go can I come back tomorrow yeah yeah
[18:38] so I come back and the uh the the
[18:41] recruiter starts handing these tests out
[18:43] I'm like great I'm going sit by my boy
[18:45] I'm going copy off my boy he had a
[18:47] different test than I did so I couldn't
[18:49] copy off him and that's when the light
[18:51] bulb hit on so I failed this test
[18:54] several times I felt it twice I actually
[18:56] felted it I felt it twice in the third
[18:58] time
[18:59] I said Mom I need help wow and she said
[19:02] um we don't have much money but we can
[19:04] afford a tutor for one hour a week for
[19:07] six months because this is my last time
[19:08] taking a test and so I had to learn so I
[19:12] I had a third grade reading level I'm a
[19:13] junior in high school yeah so I had six
[19:16] months to learn all this stuff and I
[19:18] only had a tutor for one hour a week so
[19:22] basically what happened was she would
[19:23] come in for an hour and I I wasn't
[19:26] picking it up any of it I couldn't
[19:28] retain anything and it was so much to
[19:31] learn that overwhelmed me so basically
[19:34] what happened was I
[19:36] realized I had to go by the store and
[19:38] buy spiral
[19:40] notebooks and I had to literally write
[19:44] down every single thing repeatedly like
[19:48] so what may take you an hour to learn it
[19:50] took me hours 68 n 10 hours I to write
[19:54] the same thing down simple stuff simple
[19:55] stuff I hear you man so I started memor
[19:57] that's my life I I had to memorize yeah
[20:00] what I so I didn't really learn it I
[20:02] could just recall it from writing it
[20:04] down so many times that on page 71 I
[20:06] remember seeing that yeah and that's how
[20:08] I did it and I ended up passing that
[20:10] test crazy and I got in the military so
[20:13] it's crazy yeah what was the greatest
[20:15] lesson your mom taught you growing up
[20:18] honestly the greatest lesson she ever
[20:19] taught me is a lesson that she she
[20:21] doesn't know how much she taught me
[20:24] because she wasn't much in a teaching
[20:26] mode my dad took her soul but what I did
[20:30] as a young kid is I observed everybody I
[20:34] wasn't really smart in the books yeah
[20:36] but I was real smart when it came to
[20:38] life yeah and I was able to sit back and
[20:40] watch her mistakes I was able to see how
[20:43] she struggled through life and how I
[20:45] don't want to struggle through life and
[20:48] I was able to see she never picked me up
[20:51] the biggest thing she did for me and
[20:52] this is honest to God truth and she
[20:54] doesn't even know she did it when I
[20:56] would bust my ass when I would fail yeah
[20:59] when I was at the bottom of the sewer
[21:02] she never picked me up she never gave me
[21:04] that cookie and said hey son you know
[21:06] it's going to be okay never she didn't
[21:09] have time for that and sometimes she
[21:12] gets upset when I talk about my past
[21:14] because it it pains her out to be not
[21:16] the best mom if I had any kind of mom in
[21:19] that kind of environment I would have
[21:21] never made it because she forced me for
[21:24] whatever reason she forced me to get
[21:28] better figure this out or you're going
[21:30] to be a statistic wow and this is
[21:33] something that she didn't sit down and
[21:34] tell me I realized this this is the
[21:37] world that is in front of me and what
[21:39] most people do is they see this world
[21:42] and they look at it as an excuse to get
[21:44] out of it yeah I started looking at it
[21:48] as this is the ultimate training ground
[21:52] for the rest of my life mhm I have all
[21:55] these valuable lessons cuz if you look
[21:57] out in the world right now today it's
[21:59] not a nice place but I'm very prepared
[22:01] for it yeah you are I'm prepared for it
[22:04] I'm prepared for all the failure coming
[22:05] my way I'm prepared for everything my
[22:08] way and that's the biggest lesson that
[22:10] she taught me by not teaching me by
[22:12] never saying it's going to be okay
[22:15] matter of fact she told me the exact
[22:17] opposite life
[22:18] sucks that's what she knew it was the
[22:21] truth that was her reality that was her
[22:24] reality yeah and so I saw that and so I
[22:27] started at that point in my life I have
[22:29] a lot more failures as you see in that
[22:31] book but I started down the road of
[22:34] instead of the path of you know least
[22:37] resistance I started choosing the path
[22:39] of most resistance to prepare myself for
[22:41] the journey that was coming my way wow
[22:44] and most kids don't prepare themselves
[22:45] for the most resistance they want to get
[22:47] out of things they want to get out of
[22:48] things get off the hook don't put in the
[22:50] extra reps right they want the easiest
[22:52] path to get to the top right right
[22:54] exactly huh you know I I I look at my
[22:58] life is like you and here you talk about
[23:00] like really diving into pain and like
[23:02] embracing pain and finding looking for
[23:04] the pain right and I think there's like
[23:06] a there's a there's a safe pain and then
[23:09] there's probably an unsafe pain of just
[23:11] like jumping off a building and you know
[23:13] whatever trying to land on 20 floors or
[23:15] something it's probably not the safe way
[23:16] to do things but doing 200 miles uh of
[23:20] endurance running is like a different
[23:21] way of pain looking at pain um and
[23:25] that's what I've been looking for my
[23:26] whole life is like finding the pain and
[23:27] I talk about like do something every day
[23:29] that that's painful right in a good
[23:31] structured environment you've been doing
[23:33] that for the last couple years now it's
[23:34] like you work out every day you haven't
[23:35] missed a day and do it for the last 20
[23:38] years of my life 20 20 years are years
[23:41] no 20 some years of my life 20 every day
[23:43] you work out so I used to take one day
[23:46] off a week uhhuh I used to take one day
[23:49] off a week for the body recover right
[23:50] makes sense but that one day off was an
[23:52] active recovery day where I would get on
[23:54] a trainer and ride for like two hours
[23:56] wow but at a at a Zone one heart rate
[23:59] very low heart rate and I replace the
[24:02] carbohydrates in my body while I Rod
[24:04] because the best way to recover for me
[24:07] is to do something at a very low heart
[24:09] rate because Therefore your blood's
[24:10] flowing through your body yeah as your
[24:12] blood's flowing through your body refuel
[24:14] it with the nutrients because then your
[24:17] blood's flowing the nutrients is going
[24:19] through all your cells in your body all
[24:20] that glycogen is now flowing at a low
[24:23] heart rate so it's not burning it it's
[24:25] refueling it yeah so every Sunday used
[24:27] to be that
[24:29] and it kind of snowballed into as human
[24:32] beings We Believe like so many people
[24:35] before I give them a workout plan
[24:37] they're talking about recovery everybody
[24:39] everybody that hears me speak they want
[24:41] to go straight to
[24:43] recovery work out first huh work out
[24:47] first before you talk to me about
[24:49] recovery how to recovery yeah work out
[24:51] first we are always looking for like
[24:54] whenever I talk to people people take my
[24:56] words and they and they and they put it
[24:58] in a way to where they want to feel
[25:01] comfortable this guy you know they they
[25:04] they want to put you in a box they want
[25:07] to put a title on you no you're putting
[25:09] a title on me to make yourself feel
[25:11] better about
[25:12] yourself if you read this book of mine
[25:14] and you see where I came from this
[25:16] person was th this person was not
[25:19] built this this person was not made by
[25:22] God mhm this person sorry this person
[25:24] was built I made this person I made this
[25:28] person person by diving into to the
[25:29] insecurities that life gave me cuz now
[25:32] they're yours they're yours to own if
[25:34] you're not smart call yourself dumb it's
[25:38] okay cuz you are but take that not as
[25:41] putting yourself down if you're fat call
[25:43] yourself fat I used to be 300
[25:45] lbs we we want to talk so soft to
[25:48] ourselves we're looking for that
[25:49] recovery day and that recovery day is
[25:52] everything in your life everything in
[25:54] your life is a recovery day we're
[25:55] looking for it it's not coming
[25:58] it's not coming get over that recovery
[26:01] day and that's the mentality I took with
[26:03] me and what happened through that
[26:06] process was all the frivolous things of
[26:08] life started to float away I used to
[26:11] tell people lies so they would like me
[26:14] CU I was so insecure when you start to
[26:17] build yourself up and start to have the
[26:20] one thing that we don't have is
[26:22] confidence yeah real authentic
[26:24] Confidence from hard work everything
[26:27] else goes away you no longer look to
[26:29] other people for your self-esteem
[26:32] validation yeah you now know I walk in
[26:35] the room now and I know that hours and
[26:37] years and decades I put into David
[26:40] Goggins that's something it's not on the
[26:43] wall it's not a trophy on the wall it's
[26:45] not a m around your neck it is actually
[26:47] a feeling in your heart and people go
[26:49] why don't you ever smile I don't have
[26:52] to yeah yeah I do have a stoic look in
[26:55] my face I'm I'm a very focused person
[26:57] but the feeling I have in my soul and in
[26:59] my heart that's why I don't need to
[27:01] smile I don't need to smile I don't need
[27:04] you to look at me and say oh my God you
[27:06] look happy cuz half of us aren't happy
[27:08] we're we're giving you something that we
[27:10] think you want to see I don't do that
[27:13] anymore I don't care how you perceive
[27:15] David gogins because through my journey
[27:18] I figured out the one piece I was
[27:20] missing I thought it was Cars I thought
[27:22] it was women I thought it was I thought
[27:24] it was money I thought it was everything
[27:26] the one piece I was missing was me
[27:28] Having the courage to face myself and
[27:31] once you do that on a daily basis it's
[27:33] not about the running we're people going
[27:36] you about working out where I got my
[27:37] work ethic
[27:39] from was the hours I had to spend
[27:42] learning
[27:43] this when you sit down and you're not
[27:46] smart and you have a disability yeah and
[27:49] you still want to be in the top of your
[27:51] class I didn't want to get by when I
[27:53] realized that I can learn through hard
[27:56] work and I can beat the Victorian in the
[27:59] school but I got put in 10 hours more a
[28:02] day than he does you know what kind of
[28:04] strength comes from that when you're
[28:06] sitting down that guy that that Val vior
[28:08] study for an hour and you know I caught
[28:10] you I caught you and I am dumb but I
[28:15] have the work ethic to catch you that's
[28:18] where David gagas got really invented
[28:21] yeah was at a kitchen table with 20
[28:24] spiral notebooks that were empty and
[28:26] then 3 months later down yeah they were
[28:29] full and when you can go through that I
[28:31] still have in my storage unit you go
[28:33] through these spiral notebooks of your
[28:35] life and you realiz this is how I
[28:37] learned this is unbelievable there's no
[28:39] miles it's not about the miles it's that
[28:42] having a discipline every day to say for
[28:44] me to learn this one math problem it's
[28:47] going to take me 10 hours wow and that's
[28:51] where it and you realize through hard
[28:53] work you can do you can outwork anybody
[28:57] mhm how badass they are but that's the
[29:00] part people don't want to dive into yeah
[29:03] when someone's lacking confidence in
[29:04] themselves what's the answer you would
[29:06] give them if they're like how do I gain
[29:08] more confidence it starts with yourself
[29:10] man you got to start diving into those
[29:12] things that you are afraid of you don't
[29:14] gain confidence by going to the spot
[29:17] that makes you feel good it's could be a
[29:20] false reality in the second life gives
[29:22] you that challenge all you want to do is
[29:25] go back to what made you confidence or
[29:27] or or or what gave you confidence is
[29:29] that happy spot no what gives you
[29:33] confidence what gave me confidence was
[29:35] spending years at a kitchen table trying
[29:39] to learn how to read and write on my own
[29:42] realizing I can't learn the way you
[29:44] learn I can't but I can learn what gives
[29:48] you confidence not being
[29:50] afraid it's overcoming the fear Isis
[29:54] stutter severely bad so right now I
[29:56] don't know how many people are going to
[29:57] watch this you know what gives me
[29:58] confidence is know I no longer care if I
[30:02] sin and start stuttering to you yeah
[30:04] that's what gives me confidence is
[30:06] facing these things overcoming them and
[30:08] maybe not overcoming them every day but
[30:10] facing them and facing them and fac them
[30:12] pretty soon like this you know what man
[30:13] this the word it's at it's not in that
[30:16] comfort zone it's in the discomfort zone
[30:20] is where my confidence is getting built
[30:22] mhm that's where it's getting built but
[30:24] people want they want an easier answer
[30:27] yeah there has to be an easier way
[30:29] there's not I'm sorry I searched for it
[30:32] my entire life you cheated you lied I
[30:35] lied I did everything and I still felt
[30:37] empty m i coach a lot of people nowadays
[30:42] billionaires who call me on the phone
[30:43] and say man I'm still missing
[30:46] something it's because they did what
[30:49] they were good
[30:51] at and they have this beautiful
[30:53] family two three houses cars everything
[30:57] has everything to world on the outside
[30:58] looking in like my God man how can you
[31:00] be
[31:01] unhappy I walk around with the backpack
[31:03] with all my stuff in it and no car right
[31:05] and I walk around happiest person in the
[31:08] world have nothing happy as hell it's
[31:12] because I found out the whole key to
[31:15] life it's not in all that you have to
[31:18] face yourself so many people live to be
[31:20] 100 years old and they die miserable
[31:23] having everything because they never
[31:26] examined I call it my live autopsy H you
[31:29] never examine
[31:32] this happiness peace Enlightenment it's
[31:36] all up here man it's all up here and I
[31:39] start talking like this people man you
[31:41] know I don't know it's the truth man
[31:44] yeah it is true it's all up here you
[31:46] just got to be will to go and face it
[31:48] and that's the hard part what's your
[31:50] biggest insecurity
[31:53] today I I'm not to be arrogant I don't
[31:56] have one what was the last one you had
[31:58] and when was that the last one I had was
[32:02] probably
[32:05] um still
[32:07] me me still living because I I always
[32:10] talk about I I pay rent so we live we
[32:13] used to live in a $7 a month place when
[32:15] I was growing up this in Buffalo or is
[32:17] this this is in Indiana so like we had a
[32:19] lot of money in Buffalo MH and when my
[32:22] mom left my dad we went to nothing for a
[32:25] period of time before she got on her
[32:26] feet right and that's $7 a month place
[32:29] used to be it was my it was who I was I
[32:34] was no one I was in a sewer my mom was
[32:36] there I had
[32:37] nothing and you always feel like you
[32:40] have nothing I I achieved so much I was
[32:43] a Navy SEAL I've gone through Ranger
[32:45] school I've gone through Delta Force
[32:47] selection training I I I done so much I
[32:50] I run 200 miles pullup records
[32:53] everything learned to read and write
[32:55] became pretty intelligent
[32:58] and I still was like man what is wrong
[33:00] with me it wasn't until I got real sick
[33:02] and I talked about in the last chapter
[33:04] of that book I got real sick and I was
[33:07] about um 38 years old I'm 43 now and my
[33:13] life got real quiet I I went from
[33:15] running 205 miles in 39 hours to I
[33:18] couldn't get out of bed the doctors
[33:20] couldn't figure out what was wrong with
[33:22] me but once again it was the best thing
[33:24] ever happened to me why is that in that
[33:27] moment when my whole life changed I went
[33:29] from a guy who worked out every day
[33:31] trained every day to a guy who couldn't
[33:34] get out of bed my life was taken from me
[33:36] the one thing that kept me going was my
[33:38] training now you didn't have that I
[33:40] didn't have anything now you just had to
[33:41] sit alone alone and not train and that's
[33:44] what changed me and that's when I
[33:46] realized I hadn't thought hadn't taken
[33:49] time to think about what I done in my
[33:52] life you hadn't reflected yet I had
[33:55] reflected i' done all these things but
[33:56] there was no Finish Line
[33:58] I still believe that but you must have
[34:00] time to reflect yeah I was just going I
[34:02] wouldn't even I finished a race of life
[34:05] and I wouldn't even receive my medal I
[34:07] go on you're like on to the next I get
[34:09] in the car and I go you won't even take
[34:10] the medal gone don't care about like I'm
[34:12] not going to waste an hour sitting
[34:13] around for this ceremony most people sit
[34:15] around and that's what they like they
[34:17] they need the ceremony if I accomplished
[34:19] something validation I haven't done
[34:21] anything let's go let's go let's go I'm
[34:23] just getting started I'm just getting
[34:24] start right when I started figuring out
[34:26] life that I was leaving so much in the
[34:29] tank I call my 40% rule yeah I was
[34:31] leaving so much in the tank once I
[34:33] realized my God man I was this dumb fat
[34:36] kid being bullied and now I'm 180 lb
[34:39] person lost 106 lbs in less than three
[34:41] months learn to read learn to do this
[34:43] learn to do that I was like I need more
[34:46] I was fueling my mind with everything
[34:49] and I never took time to say my God you
[34:51] came from this hell and you're here so
[34:54] those
[34:55] insecurities and this how I explain it
[34:58] the best way SEAL training became pretty
[35:01] hard and a lot of guys weren't getting
[35:02] through it so they designed a seal pep
[35:05] prep program like a boot camp for the
[35:08] boot camp that's right yeah and it was
[35:10] two months in my last two years before I
[35:12] retired from the military they sent me
[35:14] there to train these kids wow to get
[35:16] ready for 19 20 old young kids so when
[35:19] they get to Navy SE training man they
[35:21] were physical
[35:23] studs they were running swimming I mean
[35:26] they were they were hybrids wow but they
[35:29] get the buds and the same amount of
[35:32] people would quit why is that this is
[35:36] why we were training bigger stronger
[35:39] faster quitters H it's not about not the
[35:43] mind that's right we weren't diving into
[35:46] the sewer everybody's got a story we
[35:49] don't share it on social media we share
[35:52] our nice life on social media we have we
[35:55] all have a dungeon I'm just willing to
[35:57] talk about mine yeah most of us not will
[35:59] to talk about it I want to talk about my
[36:01] dungeon I wasn't getting into the
[36:04] dungeon of these guys Minds I wasn't
[36:06] building that so-called mental toughness
[36:08] mental toughness isn't something that
[36:10] you sample it's something that you live
[36:13] in every day so when something hard
[36:16] would happen to these kids like in hell
[36:18] week it would draw on something that
[36:22] made them very insecure and they look
[36:24] for Comfort whenever heart hardess comes
[36:28] and you don't know what it is it may be
[36:29] different for you than it is for me but
[36:32] you go back to your
[36:34] insecurities and then you go back to
[36:36] insecurities you then look for Comfort
[36:38] within those insecurities and we all
[36:40] look for that cookie that your mom used
[36:42] to give you when you were sad when you
[36:44] were sick we look for our wife or our
[36:47] husband we look for
[36:49] Comfort it's in those
[36:51] moments you must retrain your mind to
[36:55] think differently in hell
[36:58] I wasn't training them to do that why
[37:01] weren't you training them I wasn't
[37:02] training myself to that because at that
[37:03] time I was doing what I was told these
[37:06] guys need to meet a standard physical
[37:08] standard a physical standard the
[37:11] physical standard is not what they need
[37:13] to meet it's a mental standard you must
[37:16] meet in life so going back to when I was
[37:19] sick I was hitting the physical
[37:23] standards I wasn't meeting the mental
[37:27] standards the mental standard is you
[37:29] must know how far you've come wow I
[37:32] wasn't I I had come 8,000 miles from
[37:36] where I started but if you never know
[37:38] that you're still in the $7 a month
[37:42] place when I was sick I was able to slow
[37:45] it down and reflect back on my entire
[37:49] life and in that bed when I thought I
[37:51] was dying because that story is long
[37:54] that that sick portion of my life is
[37:55] long
[37:58] I didn't care if I died or lived wow cuz
[38:01] I was for the first time in my life
[38:02] happy wow and at peace cuz I reflected
[38:06] back on where it started you said well I
[38:08] have come a long way that's right and no
[38:09] one saved me it wasn't like someone came
[38:12] down here and guided me through life
[38:15] when you figure this out on your own the
[38:18] amount of pride and dignity and
[38:20] self-respect you have that's why I walk
[38:22] around the streets with a backpack and
[38:26] just like I don't need anything else
[38:28] yeah you figure it out by going inside
[38:31] yourself by callousing over the victim's
[38:34] mentality you're always a victim even if
[38:37] you have everything in life until you
[38:40] realize what you've achieved you have to
[38:43] first realize what you've achieved in my
[38:45] mom has accomplished so much in her life
[38:47] since my father but she hasn't done that
[38:50] one step really she doesn't acknowledge
[38:52] it and reflect back she continues to go
[38:55] back to the dungeon of her past life and
[38:59] live in that space and live in that
[39:00] space versus Liv in the space that she's
[39:01] in now and reflecting back on my God
[39:05] this is what I've done with my life so
[39:08] have you talked to her about this we
[39:10] talk about it all the time and you have
[39:13] to be willing to go there you have to be
[39:15] willing to really go there not not
[39:17] surface I don't I don't live on the
[39:19] surface of anything yeah surface is what
[39:21] got me where I was at it got me from 175
[39:23] PBS to 300 lb telling everybody I'm good
[39:27] I don't I don't give a damn I'm good no
[39:30] they're they're Hollow words a lot of us
[39:34] speaking Hollow words I used to speak in
[39:36] Hollow words I don't do anymore
[39:38] everything that comes in my mouth has
[39:40] substance is real and we all have these
[39:44] feelings in our bodies and our minds and
[39:45] our souls I act on mine a lot of us who
[39:49] are afraid of
[39:50] something we allow our minds to choose
[39:53] the path of least resistance so we go a
[39:55] different route I'm afraid of something
[39:57] is me you must con that you must do that
[40:01] yeah you have to go that way and most of
[40:04] us don't understand that mentality we go
[40:07] left and we wonder why we haven't
[40:09] fulfilled something in our lives is
[40:12] because we continue to take the journey
[40:14] that is mapped out and how I look at it
[40:17] is I I I talk in life
[40:19] like a lot of us in life want to take
[40:22] the four-lane highway that has road maps
[40:25] and all this other stuff on it man tells
[40:26] you where to go g gas stations the next
[40:29] 10 miles up you're going to see a
[40:30] McDonald's a Crackle Barrel yeah it's
[40:33] the easy route very few of us want to go
[40:35] to the right side that Cracker Barrel is
[40:37] that Midwest life that's right that's
[40:39] right that's right from Ohio it's all
[40:40] about it man Indiana cracker bar
[40:43] everywhere dude that's amazing bringing
[40:45] back memories um this is powerful
[40:49] because I've been telling people this
[40:50] I've been living that way unknowingly my
[40:53] whole life of like whatever the thing is
[40:55] I'm afraid of when I was in high school
[40:57] I started doing those things right I was
[40:59] just like I'm sick and tired of feeling
[41:01] afraid right so I need to do the things
[41:03] that scare me the most that's right you
[41:05] know I've talked about this a lot on the
[41:06] podcast Tiffany's heard me these share
[41:08] these stories but I was afraid to talk
[41:09] to girls when I was a teenager I was
[41:11] afraid of uh dancing I was afraid of
[41:14] like singing and playing music in front
[41:15] of people I was afraid of all these
[41:17] different things and so I said I'm going
[41:19] to do this I'm going to give myself a
[41:20] challenge every single day until the
[41:21] fear goes away that's right and I feel
[41:23] like that's what more of us should be
[41:25] doing I'm hearing that that's what you
[41:26] how you live your life that's all it is
[41:28] man and it helps me feel so much more
[41:30] confident when you overcome that fear of
[41:32] saying this doesn't have control over me
[41:34] anymore that's right it's like you can
[41:35] be at so much more peace it's 100% your
[41:38] life most of like like for instance I
[41:39] never thought in my wildest dreams I
[41:42] could be a Navy
[41:43] SEAL it's until you open your mind
[41:46] open-mindedness creates that we all shut
[41:48] down our mind like for instance when I
[41:50] broke the pull-up record everybody
[41:53] around me who heard the pull-up record
[41:54] was 4,020 pull-ups that's the first
[41:57] thing they did oh my God 4,000 and 24
[42:00] hours or was yeah it's 4,020 pull-ups in
[42:03] 24 hour period y the first thing I did
[42:05] versus closing my mind you're like oh my
[42:07] God that's
[42:08] crazy I went and got a pen say how many
[42:11] is that every minute exact every hour
[42:13] every second instead of taking life and
[42:15] making it out to be this grandio thing
[42:18] start breaking it down start breaking it
[42:21] down and most of us we live in a
[42:25] box and we don't want to go outside that
[42:27] box at all
[42:29] ever outside that box is all these
[42:33] possibilities of Life what we do is we
[42:35] shackle our mind we are a prisoner in
[42:37] our own mind that this is all I can do
[42:40] this is all I'm good at and we we we
[42:44] take away the possibilities of you could
[42:46] be this you could be that you could be
[42:48] all these things and I never thought at
[42:50] 300 lbs I could be n seal wow so if my
[42:52] mind was
[42:53] Shackled me and you would never meet
[42:56] there' be no book right there be no book
[42:59] right there be nothing so what people
[43:04] understand is that they live for
[43:05] themselves not knowing that you have the
[43:07] power within yourself to change millions
[43:11] of lives Yeah by face of Life by facing
[43:14] yourself and through that I I would die
[43:18] never knowing that I had the power to
[43:21] change millions of lives and what haunts
[43:23] me the most people ask me what what
[43:24] haunts you the most what haunts me the
[43:26] most is that if I would have died at 300
[43:28] lb let's say I was 75 years old I got to
[43:30] heaven and God has a chart like that on
[43:33] everybody's life God knows all let's say
[43:36] that I don't care what you believe in
[43:38] doesn't matter I'm not judging anybody
[43:40] but let's say my thing is God you get to
[43:43] heaven I'm 300 lbs I sit down I was a
[43:46] cockroach terminator my whole life and
[43:49] we're sitting down just like this you're
[43:50] God and I'm David and he gives me that
[43:52] chart and he says look at this now look
[43:55] at this chart and on theart it has all
[43:58] these different things but my name's on
[44:00] it but these things aren't me I was
[44:03] going to change the world I was going to
[44:05] I was going to set records I was going
[44:06] to be a Navy SEAL I was going to be all
[44:09] these things in the military that I
[44:10] accomplished you're going to get the VFW
[44:12] award you going to be honored here
[44:13] honored there I'm like God I was this
[44:17] isn't me like it says David gogins I was
[44:20] an Eco laab guy I spray for cockroaches
[44:22] and I'm 300 lb it said here I'm
[44:25] 185 it says here I got a
[44:27] a bachelor's and a masters it says all
[44:29] these
[44:30] things and God goes no that's who you
[44:34] were supposed to be
[44:36] wow my biggest fear in
[44:39] life is if there is a final resting
[44:41] place in this world and there's a final
[44:43] judgment and you talk to something much
[44:46] bigger than you I don't want to sit down
[44:49] and have a conversation with someone
[44:51] with something that says you're in
[44:54] heaven this is what you should have been
[44:56] on Earth
[44:58] and are you really in heaven now or are
[45:00] you in hell thinking about how much I
[45:02] left on the table for fear for not
[45:05] willing to go over the wall and over the
[45:08] next wall and over the next wall so in
[45:10] my mind I believe that and God knows all
[45:14] at least I believe
[45:16] that I want God to be up there right now
[45:19] as we're speaking writing stuff down
[45:22] saying my God he exceeded even my
[45:25] expectations that's how I live my life I
[45:27] now know that there is no cap on the
[45:31] human mind there's no cap we cap it
[45:36] ourselves wow is there a cap on the
[45:38] human body that's right is there one
[45:41] there
[45:44] I I don't believe so
[45:47] mhm because one thing I found out was I
[45:51] didn't for several years I gave myself a
[45:53] way
[45:54] out when you were 300b I was 300 lb when
[45:57] I was all way up till I was 24 years old
[46:01] I would climb a mountain I fall back
[46:03] down I start climbing I fall back down
[46:05] for the first 24 years of my life I went
[46:08] to my first hell week my second hell
[46:10] week and then my third hell week came in
[46:12] still training and the CEO Captain Bowen
[46:15] looked at me I'm on crutches I'm all
[46:17] jacked up he says hey this is your last
[46:19] time you're going to go through
[46:21] buds
[46:23] it I had several stress
[46:25] fractures I had had double pneumonia I
[46:27] was jacked up and he gave me a few
[46:29] months to heal he said this is your last
[46:31] time going through I shouldn't even let
[46:33] you go back through wow I started Navy
[46:36] SEAL training with stretch
[46:39] fractures stretch fractures not shint
[46:41] that's hard to finish stretch fractures
[46:43] starting the hardest training aru the
[46:45] hardest train in the world with stretch
[46:47] fractures and this is when I started to
[46:49] not put a cap on the body if the mind is
[46:53] there every morning I would wake up at
[46:55] 3:30 in the morning 4:00 in morning go
[46:57] to my dive cage go in there before
[47:00] anybody saw me I get duct tape and I
[47:02] would tape from my for foot all the way
[47:05] up to the midd of my calf and I would
[47:07] put two black socks on and so I ran not
[47:11] using the pivot oh my gosh and I ran my
[47:14] hip flexors so for the first 45 minutes
[47:16] to an hour I was in absolute
[47:19] excruciating pain but what motivated me
[47:23] through that whole
[47:25] process was the fact that
[47:28] this kid came from that I'm in the
[47:32] hardest training in the world in the
[47:34] worst shape of my entire
[47:36] life what if I can graduate amongst
[47:39] these studs wow all these guys around me
[47:42] are
[47:43] studs they're stallions they're
[47:46] Gladiators in my class they're all
[47:48] healthy most of them they're not broken
[47:50] like this they may have some you know
[47:52] everybody's sick going to that training
[47:54] but if I can graduate
[47:57] it would change everything for me if I
[47:59] can start the hardest train in the world
[48:01] broken and graduate so my mind fed off
[48:05] of that you are now from the weakest man
[48:08] you are now the hardest man to ever live
[48:11] if you can do this if you can do
[48:14] this life is one big mind game yeah and
[48:18] you're playing it with yourself is it
[48:19] true I don't
[48:21] care it got me through the hardest
[48:24] training starting out broken m where
[48:27] most people
[48:28] quit I had just started wow and when you
[48:32] take that mindset and you learn to flip
[48:34] that
[48:35] around that's what made me
[48:38] powerful and my body followed and three
[48:41] months later my stretch fractures were
[48:44] healed by running on
[48:47] them calcifying it just like I never had
[48:50] them since I'm 43 years old wow I ran
[48:53] 7,000 miles in 2007 haven't had a
[48:56] stretch fr sense and I'm not saying to
[48:59] do that I'm just saying that when the
[49:02] mind and the body connect and you didn't
[49:05] and you don't give yourself a way out
[49:07] the only way out for me at that time was
[49:09] death
[49:10] wow I'm going to be a Navy SEAL or I'm
[49:14] going to die or I'm going to die trying
[49:16] yeah period and my body said Roger
[49:20] that we're going to get you through this
[49:23] so when the Mind gives it no way out way
[49:26] your body says okay okay I believe you
[49:28] now I have to heal I'm going to figure
[49:30] this out with you we're going to do this
[49:32] it's going to be the the worst part of
[49:34] your life but we're you're going to
[49:35] survive we're going to survive wow and
[49:38] as you hear in that 100 mile race I did
[49:40] I started figuring out more and more and
[49:43] more and more about at the other end of
[49:47] suffering is a life that no one and I'm
[49:50] not talking about go out there and kill
[49:51] yourself don't take these words and flip
[49:54] them and say oh my God no
[49:57] it just be uncomfortable I call
[49:59] suffering don't physically injure
[50:00] yourself yes not saying that and then be
[50:02] out for six months that's no good that's
[50:04] no good I'm not saying I'm not saying do
[50:06] what I did yeah I was in a spot that
[50:09] life forced me I had a choice I had a
[50:12] choice to be this guy or the guy that's
[50:14] in front of you I had choices I chose
[50:17] this path and you're still choosing it
[50:19] I'm still choosing you go back to that
[50:20] guy any moment cuz I found out I found
[50:23] out something with those stress
[50:25] fractures I found out something through
[50:28] facing all these things I found out a
[50:30] whole another world which is why I walk
[50:32] around with all my stuff in the Black
[50:35] Backpack wow I found a whole another way
[50:38] a whole another way of no matter how far
[50:42] you get in
[50:43] life you have to be able to go back to
[50:46] scratch in your mind at a moment's
[50:49] notice you can never get so far beyond
[50:53] scratch what that means is when you
[50:56] accomplish something in life if you want
[50:57] to go back to scratch and go back to
[51:00] that $7 a month place where I once lived
[51:03] and visit that place for a long period
[51:05] of time if you were here when you went
[51:08] back to scratch you would now be here
[51:10] scratch is what makes you better scratch
[51:13] friction obstacles create growth there's
[51:17] no friction when you're this far up in
[51:19] the game anymore you think there is
[51:22] that's right when you chieve so much the
[51:23] friction is is is minor cuz why
[51:27] I'm sore I'm going to get a massage
[51:29] today mhm I'm hungry I'm going to eat
[51:32] today the refrigerator is always full so
[51:34] your Comforts are now so your discomfort
[51:37] is now very minuscule to your discomfort
[51:40] back here in the $7 month place so you
[51:43] have to go back to the total discomfort
[51:46] to then raise your level of where you're
[51:49] at now I'm not saying stay there and
[51:51] stay there visit visit it and then you
[51:55] raise your level take a trip that's
[51:57] right yeah always take day trips yeah
[52:00] don't stay there that's right but take a
[52:01] day trip take a day trip so when you
[52:03] complete some massive obstacle and
[52:06] challenge whatever the adversity that
[52:07] you force upon yourself cuz these are
[52:10] all curated experiences for yourself
[52:13] that you're scratching constantly what
[52:15] happens now since this was 5 years ago
[52:17] you would just leave you wouldn't take
[52:18] the medal you would just go onto the
[52:20] next what happens now do you take you
[52:23] know a day to reflect a moment 10
[52:25] minutes like how does the process work
[52:27] and then how do you get back to visiting
[52:29] the
[52:29] $7 uh you know place you lived in now I
[52:34] don't have to go back and visit it I
[52:36] don't have to think about it it lives
[52:38] with me now every day of my damn life
[52:43] that feeling that I had to go back and
[52:44] think about I found a way just have
[52:48] it how did you it's constantly there I
[52:51] have a selft talk I have a selft talk
[52:54] it's called My Cookie Jar mhm and it's a
[52:56] constant reminder of David guy every day
[52:59] of my life I believe in quiet there's no
[53:02] growth outside of
[53:05] quiet the the world's too noisy your
[53:08] mind needs quiet for you to find who you
[53:11] are people ask what's my purpose why am
[53:13] I here you're not going to find it
[53:15] nowadays unless you lock yourself in a
[53:17] quiet room in your mind and find it it's
[53:21] too noisy for me I could be in a busy
[53:24] Street in New York City horns home
[53:27] and I'm walking around with like nothing
[53:30] it's me and myself in a quiet spot and
[53:35] when you are constantly reflecting on
[53:37] who you are where you've been the
[53:39] journey you've gone through the Journey
[53:41] you can continue going
[53:42] through the feeling is always there you
[53:45] don't allow the world to pull you so
[53:48] fast that you forget you don't allow
[53:51] yourself to pull you so fast that you
[53:53] forget it's not about staying in that
[53:55] moment
[53:56] it's about you want to get to the point
[53:58] where that feeling follows you like
[54:02] breathing becomes a part of your life
[54:05] part of your DNA but it's made like
[54:08] these CES on my hands right now they're
[54:10] made yeah they are now on my brain this
[54:12] is now a part of me it's a daily process
[54:16] a part of me and how I go back to a $7 a
[54:19] month
[54:20] place all the time is now I go out and I
[54:25] dig fire line I'm a wildland firefighter

[54:42] so I make I have a good living now for
[54:44] me where I'm at in my

[55:20] it's like a hole you're a line so you're
[55:22] trying to get down to to a mineral sore
[55:24] so so you're trying to get down to the
[55:25] to the Earth
[55:27] so so that if that fire is moving it
[55:30] can't burn dirt really so you're moving
[55:32] fuels got it you know so so not only are
[55:34] you digging you're cutting down trees
[55:36] it's hard work but the moral story is
[55:39] I'm 43 don't need to do it at all this
[55:41] is why I do it you're making money I'm
[55:43] making money I'm I I I I have a good
[55:45] life I don't need to do
[55:47] it everybody ask me why I do it this is
[55:50] why this 21 year old kid was out
[55:53] there and he wanted a pair of running
[55:56] shoes so all you want was a pair of
[55:58] running
[55:59] shoes 60 70 100 bucks whatever you know
[56:02] easy for us
[56:04] shoes he looked up at the
[56:07] mountain that we had been on for days
[56:09] digging this fire
[56:11] line and he said that'll take me five or
[56:13] six hours of work to buy those shoes so
[56:16] I'm not going to buy them it's the
[56:18] perspective of life that perspective of
[56:21] life right there of that is the value
[56:24] that we lose when things start to come
[56:27] so easy in life it's the perspective
[56:31] that 21y old had we looked about that
[56:33] mountain and thought he looked at his
[56:34] hands he looked at the at the amount of
[56:36] hours of pulling that palasi that that
[56:39] tool and raking that ground and and then
[56:41] cutting those trees and moving them and
[56:44] that hours of work he looked at his feet
[56:46] and said these old shoes would
[56:49] do it's that perspective in life that we
[56:52] lose and that's that story to most
[56:55] people may not mean anything
[56:57] it's that story I always want to have in
[56:59] my life you cannot lose
[57:02] perspective of where you've come in life
[57:05] yeah so true we were in uh Guatemala was
[57:08] it this year or last year last year we
[57:10] were in Guatemala last year we we
[57:12] support a a charity called pensil the
[57:14] promise that builds schools for kids who
[57:16] live in poverty all around the world and
[57:19] every year I take a trip to just see
[57:22] where our efforts are being you know
[57:24] felt and and being and being made
[57:26] and uh these are the poorest places in
[57:28] Guatemala LA and Ghana places that they
[57:31] have nothing there's no Schools they're
[57:33] little Villages they live on dirt Huts
[57:36] everything right and we go and we build
[57:39] these schools we actually the The
[57:41] Villages build them themselves we just
[57:43] fund the experience and they Empower we
[57:45] Empower them to do it um so that they
[57:47] take ownership of it right but I'll be
[57:49] there for a few days and watch these
[57:51] kids so happy with just like a pencil
[57:53] right just so happy to just like have
[57:56] their family around and they'll go and
[57:57] they'll show us their huts and like
[57:59] they're just so happy to have community
[58:01] and then I'll fly
[58:03] back and go through Beverly Hills right
[58:06] over here and I'll see like these
[58:08] Mansions you know I live right next to
[58:10] it and I'm just like it gives me so much
[58:12] perspective of like you don't need to
[58:15] have all these things to find peace and
[58:17] joy and connection and intimacy and all
[58:21] these and all these other things that we
[58:22] want you don't need these big mansions
[58:25] and to live in this nice place you know
[58:26] I like living here but it's not like
[58:28] it's perspective for me is what keeps me
[58:31] motivated as well that's right to to
[58:34] keep doing the right things to keep
[58:35] showing up keep working hard and I think
[58:37] it's right most of us miss that
[58:39] perspective in life we get so far away
[58:41] from reality so far and the reality is
[58:44] man when I was 7 years old8 years old
[58:47] all I wanted was a 99 cent Quarter
[58:49] Pounder from Hardies I know right and
[58:52] that made me happy as hell some curly
[58:53] fries man that's it man that's it
[58:57] yeah the thing is a lot of us have been
[58:59] um conditioned or some of us grew up
[59:02] with wealth or grew up with Comfort
[59:04] right so we're conditioned that way and
[59:06] we're grow up expecting now that things
[59:08] should come a lot easier right that's a
[59:10] damn shame and we get we get uh
[59:13] frustrated when we don't get it right
[59:14] quickly quickly yes yeah and I'm always
[59:17] talking about delayed gratification like
[59:19] the longer I can wait to receive
[59:21] gratification that's right the more
[59:23] fulfilled I am I'm a person so when I
[59:25] got sick like I did um I actually had to
[59:28] quit this race called badwater yeah 135
[59:31] miles through Death Valley it was 2014 I
[59:34] got real real bad I pulled out of the
[59:37] race at Mile 50 I went to the emergency
[59:39] room and the doctor like you know we
[59:42] can't find this we can't find that we
[59:44] know what's wrong with you when I got in
[59:45] that bed so this is the crazy thing
[59:47] about gratification long term I'm able
[59:51] to watch grass grow by finding out this
[59:54] I sat there couldn't run a half a
[59:58] quarter mile couldn't get out of bed the
[01:00:00] only thought I had in my mind I I pull
[01:00:03] out that race I told myself I'm GNA go
[01:00:06] back to badw waterer one day and rent it
[01:00:08] I'm GNA win the race haven't been back
[01:00:12] since haven't been back
[01:00:15] since 2019 I'm not saying I'm win it I'm
[01:00:18] just now in the shape to go back wow
[01:00:21] haven't w a 100 mile race since 2014 wow
[01:00:24] because I've been that sick I'm just now
[01:00:27] imagine the gratification I'm going to
[01:00:29] get by getting to the startline that
[01:00:30] race and what if I can win it be pretty
[01:00:34] sweet pretty sweet four or five years
[01:00:36] yeah imagine that of having that kind of
[01:00:38] of having that kind of self-discipline
[01:00:40] to every day wake up and having these
[01:00:42] setbacks where I can't even run a mile
[01:00:44] wow but I'm thinking about running
[01:00:46] 135 I can't run one mile but I'm
[01:00:51] thinking about running 135 and with that
[01:00:54] process guess what happens sooner or
[01:00:56] later you can run 10 miles may take a
[01:00:59] year but it gives you more and more hope
[01:01:01] that possible and I'm at the point now
[01:01:04] where guess what it's right around the
[01:01:06] corner wow most people in that time
[01:01:08] frame in that in that in that
[01:01:10] mindset I can't run anymore it's over no
[01:01:15] it's just going to take a little bit
[01:01:16] longer you have to turn the negative
[01:01:19] into a positive because at the end of it
[01:01:21] all if you can sit back and wait if you
[01:01:24] can wait 6 7 8 9 10 12
[01:01:27] years when you get to that point when
[01:01:29] you
[01:01:30] finish that's the feeling for 12 years I
[01:01:33] say I say wa 12 years to get there
[01:01:36] that's what keeps you going is you got
[01:01:37] to feel I want I'm doing it for one
[01:01:43] second years of pain for one
[01:01:48] second one
[01:01:50] second think about it you cross the
[01:01:53] finish line it's over one second
[01:01:56] most people do that and then one second
[01:01:59] isn't what they thought it would be and
[01:02:01] then they're pissed and upset and they
[01:02:02] keep going on to the next because they
[01:02:04] never reflect back on what they did it's
[01:02:06] not the 1 second it's the 12 years yeah
[01:02:09] it's the 12
[01:02:11] years that I want it's not the race MH
[01:02:15] it's the 12
[01:02:16] years while you did it it's not the
[01:02:19] winning not the it's not what place you
[01:02:21] got no but most of us focus on right oh
[01:02:24] I got to win this that's right if I
[01:02:26] don't I'm going to be upset I would
[01:02:27] achieve all my athletic goals for years
[01:02:31] and then 10 minutes later be the
[01:02:32] angriest person in the world so angry
[01:02:34] and frustrated nasty with people and I
[01:02:36] would delay my gratification for years
[01:02:38] to achieve what I wanted right and I
[01:02:40] never understood that either being a
[01:02:43] perfectionist is the worst thing that
[01:02:44] can happen to a person you never live
[01:02:47] like when I lost that 106 PBS in like 2
[01:02:49] and a half months whatever it took
[01:02:52] me that was the biggest trophy in my
[01:02:54] entire life I didn't care if I graduate
[01:02:56] Navy still training I didn't care what I
[01:02:59] just accomplished in that time frame
[01:03:01] it's massive yeah I don't know there was
[01:03:04] no trainer I I I there was no like and
[01:03:06] what's funny about this we talk about
[01:03:08] mental toughness nowadays it's like the
[01:03:10] biggest crave when I grew up it was just
[01:03:13] suck it up yeah it was just make it
[01:03:16] happen yeah you had to figure out it's
[01:03:20] it was called figure it out man and all
[01:03:23] these all these nuggets that I gained
[01:03:25] along the way that's what was about it
[01:03:26] went about the Trident it went about all
[01:03:28] those de on medals it was about any of
[01:03:30] that and that's why I hate even talking
[01:03:33] about being a seal you know I miss the
[01:03:35] stories why you talk about it didn't
[01:03:37] Define me the journey getting there was
[01:03:40] harder than going through it yeah you
[01:03:42] know so that's the whole thing about
[01:03:44] life man it's it's that Journey that
[01:03:46] that makes you who you are yeah and and
[01:03:48] as opposed to focusing on did I win or
[01:03:50] not right what did I gained from the
[01:03:52] last 12 years right and so when you
[01:03:54] finish now you think about how how long
[01:03:57] do you reflect back on the effort it
[01:03:59] took to accomplish that race or a long
[01:04:02] time what's days time weeks years you
[01:04:06] reflect on it I reflect back now there's
[01:04:08] times now where I will reflect back on
[01:04:11] my first 100 mile race still today still
[01:04:14] today and it'll give me the same exact
[01:04:18] feeling because what I did in that first
[01:04:20] race when I was undertrained I did it on
[01:04:24] four days notice I hadn't run more than
[01:04:27] I think 20 miles the whole year and I
[01:04:30] and I did it to raise money for his
[01:04:32] foundation to you know to try to get in
[01:04:34] the bad water what I had to pull out of
[01:04:37] myself on that last that's where that
[01:04:39] book limit the seal kind of originated
[01:04:41] Jesse ller saw me at this race he was
[01:04:43] racing too yeah but he did it as a team
[01:04:46] right you did alone I did it alone and
[01:04:48] that's what I talking with people about
[01:04:49] man I spent so much time people always
[01:04:52] like why do you run so much you know you
[01:04:54] you you know try to get in shape no
[01:04:56] the things I do in life most of life
[01:05:00] you're alone you may have a whole
[01:05:02] support crew around you but up here
[01:05:06] you're
[01:05:06] alone most of the stuff I do I'm
[01:05:09] training for that one those moments
[01:05:12] those moments when I was at Mile 70 and
[01:05:14] I had 30 more miles to go and I had I
[01:05:16] crapped up my back and peeing blood down
[01:05:18] my leg at 30 miles to go there's only so
[01:05:21] much someone cheering can do for you
[01:05:23] right when you start to dive back in the
[01:05:25] cell of your mind and you're pulling out
[01:05:28] all these all these tactics all these
[01:05:31] mental tactics to get through this 30
[01:05:33] miles when you're in the worst shape of
[01:05:35] your life and no one's coming to save
[01:05:37] you and you get through
[01:05:39] that I I want to go back there like when
[01:05:42] I got doing that race I laid in the tub
[01:05:45] and my ex-wife helped me get up the
[01:05:47] stairs and I'm laying in this
[01:05:49] tub and Coca colola is coming out of me
[01:05:52] just look like dirt and she and you know
[01:05:54] she's a nurse and she's like she's
[01:05:56] freaking out and she puts the shower on
[01:05:58] me and I'm looking at her and all I want
[01:06:01] to do is call the race director up of
[01:06:04] badwar said I qualify for the race and
[01:06:07] she's thinking we got to go to the
[01:06:08] hospital so you know she's she's calling
[01:06:10] my mom and my mom has a doctor friend of
[01:06:11] hers who's over and they're freaking out
[01:06:15] and I said everybody just shut up wow
[01:06:18] shut up I'm in the worst pain in my
[01:06:19] entire life and no one would ever
[01:06:21] understand this no one when you've gone
[01:06:23] that deep inside yourself and all those
[01:06:26] feelings of pain that I had I was in the
[01:06:28] worst pain of my life ever and some
[01:06:32] people think man you're just
[01:06:34] crazy no when you've when you've done
[01:06:38] that and you figured out so much on your
[01:06:42] own and all that pain and discomfort I
[01:06:45] had that tub laying there passing out
[01:06:48] everything was confirmation of what I
[01:06:51] just figured out I just figured out the
[01:06:53] code I figured out a code a code that
[01:06:58] many people aren't looking
[01:07:01] for and I want it to be numb I I want
[01:07:03] that feeling this was confirmation this
[01:07:06] was like a scientist's notes MH the
[01:07:09] notes were here the notes were all this
[01:07:12] feeling it was a
[01:07:13] confirmation and no one at that time
[01:07:17] could understand what I just done I
[01:07:19] cracked the code the human potential in
[01:07:23] myself and I was still like oh my God
[01:07:26] like this is unbelievable what I just
[01:07:28] did so it's that quiet place wow it's
[01:07:32] that place by yourself it's those hours
[01:07:35] and years and decades by
[01:07:37] yourself in the grip of life when life
[01:07:41] has you by the throat and choking you
[01:07:43] out and you're sitting there
[01:07:45] calm because you're trying to figure it
[01:07:48] out you're not panicking you're not
[01:07:50] quitting you're not throwing in the
[01:07:51] towel you're saying there's a way around
[01:07:53] this and when you figure it out when
[01:07:55] life has you gripped in a vice and you
[01:07:58] can figure that
[01:08:00] out that's when you
[01:08:02] overcome that's when you overcome and
[01:08:05] that's why that one moment for me in
[01:08:07] that tub I didn't want anyone to take
[01:08:09] away from me
[01:08:12] wow this is crazy man I love this do you
[01:08:16] have any fears
[01:08:18] today I do have a lot of fears today um
[01:08:23] but it's hard for me to call them fears
[01:08:24] anymore
[01:08:26] I don't use that word anymore they're
[01:08:28] almost like it's another challenge yeah
[01:08:31] because anything that makes me feel that
[01:08:33] fear feeling is going to get overcome
[01:08:36] you go do it it's going to get conquered
[01:08:38] it it that is that's almost like fear is
[01:08:41] my ultimate guide of where you're
[01:08:44] supposed to be going where I'm supposed
[01:08:45] to be going it's my Ultimate Guide so I
[01:08:48] what's the big what's the big challenge
[01:08:49] then for you then the biggest challenge
[01:08:51] for me is always going I want to be
[01:08:54] comfortable you want to be comfortable
[01:08:57] you want to sleep in a nice bed and
[01:08:58] relax normal human being you want to
[01:09:00] chill out yeah I want and the time is
[01:09:03] going to come it's time for everybody to
[01:09:06] get
[01:09:07] civilized the worst thing in life that
[01:09:09] happens to a man is that get civilized
[01:09:10] or a woman anybody because you lose the
[01:09:12] hunger for life you you you you think
[01:09:16] you've arrived and once you have a I've
[01:09:17] arrived mentality that's my biggest fear
[01:09:20] is I get to the point where I I'm at
[01:09:22] that point where life has come to me and
[01:09:24] I have that feeling about I've arrived I
[01:09:27] now know my life for what I know it to
[01:09:30] be is over even though that's where
[01:09:33] Comfort is and everything else I found
[01:09:35] the most life in the most
[01:09:39] uncomfortable places in the world I was
[01:09:42] the most David the the the goggin that I
[01:09:46] invented because David gogin was
[01:09:49] weak I never want to get rid of gogin
[01:09:52] the guy I created that weak person that
[01:09:56] that that used to be the guy I created
[01:09:58] that can handle
[01:10:00] anything you don't want to let go of
[01:10:02] that guy because you realize that that
[01:10:03] guy was made you weren't born him and
[01:10:07] that is when when you get comfortable
[01:10:10] gagin starts to
[01:10:11] die he starts to die that that that one
[01:10:15] Creature from the Black Lagoon that can
[01:10:18] live in a sewer that can eat rats all
[01:10:20] day that doesn't need water that doesn't
[01:10:22] need sunlight that do need nothing he
[01:10:24] can just live CU he knows he can that's
[01:10:28] a powerful human being that you never
[01:10:30] want to in it's in everybody that's the
[01:10:34] scary thing about that's what makes me
[01:10:35] so upset
[01:10:37] man is that everybody wants to put this
[01:10:40] Dagon label on me they forget the first
[01:10:44] three chapters of my
[01:10:46] book they forget how this
[01:10:49] started a lot of times it takes
[01:10:51] someone's wife dying or something like
[01:10:53] that for them to change yeah near death
[01:10:55] yeah something no no no none of
[01:11:00] that I wanted to figure out is there
[01:11:04] more to this horrible feeling of feeling
[01:11:06] like a
[01:11:07] loser can I change this and once you
[01:11:10] figure out I have the ability not
[01:11:12] through your mom or your dad or through
[01:11:14] a special school through you you have
[01:11:17] the ability to change this that's what
[01:11:18] makes me so mad once people put this
[01:11:20] title on me you now give yourself a get
[01:11:23] out of jail free card and say oh he's
[01:11:25] just crazy he's special he's unique he's
[01:11:27] this and that you just saved yourself
[01:11:30] from not having to do the work not
[01:11:32] having to do the work yeah and that's
[01:11:34] why I want people to hear my
[01:11:37] story I'm trying to take away all that
[01:11:40] bull craap that you want to put on me
[01:11:43] I'm trying to make you suffer up here to
[01:11:45] know what my Gody man he really had a
[01:11:48] hard way to go wow there was nothing
[01:11:50] special about him he wasn't talented he
[01:11:52] wasn't gifted he was nothing
[01:11:55] he wasn't nothing and he made it I want
[01:11:58] everybody to feel uncomfortable around
[01:12:01] me that's it cuz I want you to go home
[01:12:03] and think about yourself yeah think
[01:12:06] about yourself man because you're
[01:12:07] leaving so much on the table for the
[01:12:10] possibilities of which you can be you
[01:12:12] say most people are at 40% potential
[01:12:14] what percent are you
[01:12:16] at I like to say that I live in the 90%
[01:12:20] tole sometimes 99 100% is dead wow % is
[01:12:25] dead 99 sometimes 99 sometimes the
[01:12:27] reason why I know 99
[01:12:30] because the first five hours of my
[01:12:34] day I am very uncomfortable what do you
[01:12:38] do first of all every morning I get up
[01:12:40] and people think I love to run I don't
[01:12:44] you know that's why do that's why I do
[01:12:45] it and and people don't understand that
[01:12:46] mentality oh you have to love it man
[01:12:49] no running has changed my life because
[01:12:53] every morning I know I'm going to do it
[01:12:54] if you know every every morning you do
[01:12:55] something you don't like every morning I
[01:12:58] going do it for and guess what if ice
[01:13:00] ran for an hour a day a day is 24 hours
[01:13:03] right what percent is that what's 1 hour
[01:13:07] of 20 was that 4% a small percent but
[01:13:12] anyway that's why I know I'm at a a high
[01:13:15] level because I'm at a dis not wanting
[01:13:18] to be dis you know uncomfortable I put
[01:13:20] myself in the dungeon every day off jump
[01:13:24] out of bed
[01:13:25] it starts shoes on out of bed while most
[01:13:28] people lose the battle in the morning
[01:13:31] like once you leave your beautiful house
[01:13:34] the war starts nowadays it starts before
[01:13:36] you leave home the phone rings social
[01:13:39] media is up the world's attacking
[01:13:41] you if you don't control what you can to
[01:13:44] build that armor so in the morning time
[01:13:46] what I'm doing is I'm building my armor
[01:13:50] it gets broken every night I get up in
[01:13:52] the morning time I start to build the
[01:13:53] armor let's run okay got to do our
[01:13:55] push-ups or sit ups our pull-ups you got
[01:13:56] go to the gym got do our stretch every
[01:13:58] morning I'm you do one hour in the
[01:14:00] morning of training oh no in the morning
[01:14:02] time I do at least an hour and a half
[01:14:04] and then I go to the gym of running hour
[01:14:06] and a half of running yes then I'm in
[01:14:08] the gym and then at night time every
[01:14:11] night for the last five to six years
[01:14:14] about five and a half years I've only
[01:14:16] missed two days of stretching for two to
[01:14:18] three hours two to three hours a night
[01:14:20] stretching I've only missed two days in
[01:14:24] five or about five and a half years wow
[01:14:26] stretching stretching why stretching
[01:14:29] that is where so the the sickness I had
[01:14:32] was my soas muscle got real tight huh
[01:14:35] and it caused my body long story short
[01:14:38] to pretty much choke me out from the
[01:14:39] inside so when you're young your soaz
[01:14:42] muscle your fighter flight muscle we're
[01:14:44] sitting down right now we're using the
[01:14:45] hit flexion muscle uhhuh when you're
[01:14:48] under stress as I was my whole life by
[01:14:50] being afraid of my father being tight
[01:14:52] your whole body is tight then I choose a
[01:14:53] job like being a Navy SEAL it's even
[01:14:55] Tighter and then I put myself under
[01:14:58] stress it's just tighten and tighten and
[01:15:00] tighten to it's a vice grip and you need
[01:15:03] healthy blood flow through your body I
[01:15:05] wasn't getting any of that so I pushed
[01:15:07] so hard in in life people say oh because
[01:15:09] you ran so much no sorry life emotional
[01:15:13] stress yes emotional stress made me just
[01:15:16] tight so now I couldn't sit down here
[01:15:19] for 10 seconds and I'd be like I was
[01:15:22] wound what that's done to me is allowed
[01:15:24] me to be even open even more
[01:15:27] open-minded I stretch out I get my body
[01:15:30] lengthened out it lengthens my mind out
[01:15:32] the possibilities out I calm myself down
[01:15:35] so during the morning time I build the
[01:15:37] armor I face the world because now I
[01:15:40] know there's going to be some
[01:15:41] disappointments along the way every day
[01:15:44] yes that's life but if you face
[01:15:46] disappointments already in Victory the
[01:15:49] things I can control is I can control my
[01:15:51] run mm I can control how my house looks
[01:15:54] how my how my world is I can control
[01:15:56] that so I've won open my door of Life
[01:15:59] Life Starts to beat me down but I'm
[01:16:01] facing it with the body armor that I
[01:16:02] created yes and now I'm facing life with
[01:16:05] with with the proper tools unlike I hit
[01:16:08] this snooze button I'm running late my
[01:16:11] house is a mess my mind's a mess now
[01:16:14] life's already beat you so you open the
[01:16:16] door and now life hit you and you're
[01:16:18] already frustrated you're already in
[01:16:20] that anxiety mode you're stressed
[01:16:22] already and then Life Starts to pow more
[01:16:24] on top you get home you're exhausted and
[01:16:27] that's how life happens to
[01:16:29] everyone you have to live and win what
[01:16:33] you can and build the body armor start
[01:16:36] callousing the mind so you're ready for
[01:16:38] combat outside of your house cuz it's
[01:16:41] going to come and that's what I realized
[01:16:43] at a young age I had no body armor I had
[01:16:46] no callous so when life came at me I I
[01:16:51] ran I tucked I lived in the fetal
[01:16:54] position trying to get away from life I
[01:16:57] wasn't protected I didn't protect myself
[01:16:59] I had nothing so I started realizing I
[01:17:02] got to form an
[01:17:03] armor to so I won't have to lie to you
[01:17:07] to make you like me so I'm not
[01:17:09] approaching people feeling insecure
[01:17:11] saying I have all these material things
[01:17:13] I don't have when you have that body
[01:17:15] armor you tell people hey man I'm not
[01:17:18] real
[01:17:19] smart but I try real hard mhm not the
[01:17:23] fact I I won't win this race man but
[01:17:24] been running for the last four years
[01:17:26] every day that's pretty good yeah that's
[01:17:29] the that's the mentality that you need
[01:17:30] to have yeah look at people knowing I
[01:17:33] know you and everybody else has issues
[01:17:36] so why am I why am I worried about how
[01:17:40] anybody thinks to me we're all on the
[01:17:41] same boat here some boats may be bigger
[01:17:43] than others but we all have
[01:17:48] problems so be it we're on the same boat
[01:17:51] yeah some of us are willing to not lie
[01:17:53] about it yeah
[01:17:55] I'm at that point now where I no longer
[01:17:57] care because why why can I go on here
[01:17:59] and tell people how up I am
[01:18:01] because I faced
[01:18:03] them they no longer Define who I am yeah
[01:18:06] it's not me it was me they don't control
[01:18:08] you anymore
[01:18:11] yeah when you're training in the morning
[01:18:13] or training at night or stretching at
[01:18:15] night what are you visualizing or
[01:18:17] thinking
[01:18:18] about nothing when I'm training in the
[01:18:21] morning
[01:18:22] time and it's a run for an hour and a
[01:18:24] half in the gymm and sometimes it's
[01:18:26] longer calisthenic type stuff an hour to
[01:18:28] an hour and a half is is the minimum
[01:18:30] yeah if I'm doing like a like a 100 mile
[01:18:33] race which you know like now I'm
[01:18:34] starting to build my miles back up come
[01:18:36] training for a race in January you know
[01:18:39] that that could be two two and a half
[01:18:40] three hours then once I come home from
[01:18:42] that it's right in the gym immediately
[01:18:44] so I'm exhausted I'm tired I'm
[01:18:46] dehydrated sodium low everything and
[01:18:50] that's where that's the edge because
[01:18:52] it's even more uncomfortable to do that
[01:18:54] that's right because all I want to do
[01:18:55] then stretch water relax that's it I had
[01:18:59] a long run I'm hot I'm dehydrated you
[01:19:02] already didn't want to run that's right
[01:19:04] so that's when because
[01:19:08] why in the race of Life life's not going
[01:19:11] to give you a glass of water when you're
[01:19:15] thirsty and I realized that and once
[01:19:19] again people my God your life is
[01:19:20] horrible it's not yeah this is how I
[01:19:23] live This is How I Live this is what I
[01:19:26] want I don't judge anybody this is how I
[01:19:29] live and there if there's not people
[01:19:33] like me in this world with this kind of
[01:19:36] mentality it's not be like David goggin
[01:19:39] go run 200 miles take something from
[01:19:43] this take something from this remember
[01:19:46] where I started from you don't need to
[01:19:48] go where I went right I went this far
[01:19:51] cuz I started opening different doors to
[01:19:54] the sell in my brain my God is this
[01:19:57] possible oh my God that's possible this
[01:19:59] possible I start open up different
[01:20:01] compartments you can leave them shut I
[01:20:04] don't care so what I do now in the
[01:20:07] morning time is I do this because why
[01:20:08] life's not going to give me the get out
[01:20:10] jail free card yeah and if I come on
[01:20:13] here on this podcast and talk this stuff
[01:20:16] I have to live what I say so when you
[01:20:19] come up from a world of used to lie a
[01:20:21] lot and my big thing is facing all this
[01:20:24] cra
[01:20:26] I cannot tell you something I have not
[01:20:28] done right cuz why when you start to
[01:20:30] formulate this
[01:20:33] character this code of ethic this ethos
[01:20:36] that you live not anybody else it's your
[01:20:39] own I cannot tell you something that I
[01:20:42] haven't done why because it will haunt
[01:20:44] me you are now drinking the coola a lot
[01:20:47] of people write books on self-help
[01:20:49] mental toughness all this
[01:20:51] crap half of them are living up to that
[01:20:55] standard
[01:20:56] mhm half of them are living up to that
[01:20:59] standard you have to be able to practice
[01:21:02] what you preach it has to be what you
[01:21:04] are that's why when people say my god
[01:21:06] when you speak on stuff it's so
[01:21:08] passionate because you're making me
[01:21:09] relive my life right it's not a
[01:21:12] comfortable life this life was made this
[01:21:15] life was earned yeah and if people like
[01:21:18] it great if not so be it at night time I
[01:21:21] think about
[01:21:22] nothing when you're stretching or when
[01:21:24] you're I'm stretching yeah that's my
[01:21:26] time that's my time to sit back and
[01:21:30] recharge for
[01:21:32] tomorrow because why this is not mental
[01:21:35] toughness is not a class we had this
[01:21:39] class that they
[01:21:41] designed eat the elfant one by that time
[01:21:45] selft talk
[01:21:47] visualization arousal
[01:21:49] control it's all great it's all great
[01:21:54] has to be a lifestyle
[01:21:57] yeah you work on mental callousing on a
[01:22:02] daily basis CU your even though your
[01:22:05] brain your mind like like your brain
[01:22:07] isn't the muscle so
[01:22:08] much you will lose it you will lose the
[01:22:12] ability to suffer in the worst of times
[01:22:14] if you come out of it for too
[01:22:17] long if you can lift 315 pounds and you
[01:22:21] stop going to the gym for a month I
[01:22:24] guarantee you won't be able to pick the
[01:22:25] same weight up again all the stories I
[01:22:28] talked about today all the things in
[01:22:30] that book if I went and said I'm
[01:22:36] good I gained all this
[01:22:39] knowledge if I sto today the knowledge
[01:22:42] is gone yeah I have to go back deep to
[01:22:46] retrieve it I don't want to go back deep
[01:22:48] to retrieve it I want to be able to call
[01:22:50] on it now that's why I do these things I
[01:22:54] know
[01:22:55] with not doing them will get me right
[01:22:57] right there's so much more I want to ask
[01:23:00] you but I want to try to wrap it up here
[01:23:02] with with three final questions um I
[01:23:05] didn't even get to any of the questions
[01:23:06] I had on here because I was just so
[01:23:07] inspired by everything but if you guys
[01:23:10] haven't uh picked this up yet you can
[01:23:12] pre-order it right now uh again can't
[01:23:15] hurt me master your mind and defy the
[01:23:17] odds make sure you guys get this book
[01:23:19] get a few copies for friends give them
[01:23:21] out as gifts this would be one of the
[01:23:22] most powerful things you give to someone
[01:23:25] um this is called actually I'm curious
[01:23:27] about I didn't I asked you about the
[01:23:28] greatest lesson from your mom but I'm
[01:23:30] I'm curious what's the greatest lesson
[01:23:31] your dad taught you whether he actually
[01:23:33] said it or you observed it um I observed
[01:23:36] it or or what not to do or yeah so I
[01:23:40] observed it from my dad um when I left I
[01:23:43] was young I had a young man's a young
[01:23:46] kid's point of view on my father so when
[01:23:50] I was
[01:23:51] 22 at 300 lb I went back to see my dad
[01:23:57] cuz I want to make sure that what I saw
[01:24:01] at
[01:24:01] 8 is the same vision because it's my
[01:24:05] father I don't want to not talk to my
[01:24:08] father no matter what he did no matter
[01:24:09] what I saw but was it through a young
[01:24:11] kid's eyes so at 22 I went
[01:24:14] back and I was able to examine him at a
[01:24:18] as a as a man as a fragile man that I
[01:24:22] was sure but I was able to examine
[01:24:24] him and through this process by this so
[01:24:27] by this point in my life I was examining
[01:24:29] myself and realizing I have a whole mess
[01:24:32] of problems Big Time some were from him
[01:24:38] some were for people that bullied me a
[01:24:40] lot were from me and in knowing how
[01:24:43] messed up I was I was able to examine
[01:24:46] everybody around me I examined
[01:24:49] him and I examined him to know my God
[01:24:53] the insec ities that you must have the
[01:24:56] problems that you must have inside of
[01:24:58] you I don't want to have
[01:25:01] those I come from my
[01:25:04] father I have what he
[01:25:07] has and I didn't want to be
[01:25:10] him why he made fun of me my brother why
[01:25:13] he beat the hell out of me my brother my
[01:25:16] mom it comes from a dark place an
[01:25:19] insecure dark dark place why he
[01:25:21] womanized why he sold prostitutes why he
[01:25:24] ran vire all this stuff he
[01:25:26] did a good human being doesn't need to
[01:25:29] do that a fulfilled human being doesn't
[01:25:32] need to break anyone down all they do is
[01:25:35] want to build you up so anybody you meet
[01:25:39] that calls you out of your name that
[01:25:42] bullies you that messes you up that that
[01:25:44] makes you
[01:25:45] feel not lifted they are dealing with
[01:25:49] something Dee
[01:25:50] rooted yeah you have to have a tough
[01:25:53] tone with some people to help them out
[01:25:55] there's a difference you have to be hard
[01:25:57] I'm hard on people but it comes from a
[01:26:00] good place yeah the biggest lesson he
[01:26:02] taught me was how not to be and that's
[01:26:05] why I had to fix what I was because
[01:26:10] insecurities make everybody around you
[01:26:13] feel like hell and that's the one thing
[01:26:16] I did not want anyone to feel like
[01:26:18] that's why I judge no one tons of whites
[01:26:20] have called me I've been tons of people
[01:26:23] have hurt me
[01:26:25] I judge no one because I know where it
[01:26:28] comes from I know you I was once you
[01:26:33] that's why now the place I'm at you get
[01:26:36] a get out of jail free card you need to
[01:26:38] help yourself you ain't bullying me man
[01:26:41] right you're fine you're I'm good
[01:26:43] whatever you throw at you I'm good I
[01:26:45] know what's wrong with you cuz I was
[01:26:46] once you right so I started to examine
[01:26:50] people examine myself examine my
[01:26:53] darkness
[01:26:55] realizing how I cannot be but I got it
[01:26:58] from examining him saying I cannot be
[01:27:01] that that's a powerful lesson so it's
[01:27:04] it's good lesson that he taught you yes
[01:27:05] through that observance how do you react
[01:27:08] or respond when someone says something
[01:27:10] to you negative or Cuts you off in a car
[01:27:14] or just something happens in life every
[01:27:15] day that could potentially upset you do
[01:27:18] you react do you respond do you do
[01:27:20] nothing do you give them a hug I mean
[01:27:23] what is the process for the process used
[01:27:25] to be angry David go scream at them
[01:27:27] swear at them yeah pick a fight that was
[01:27:30] the old me yeah the old me was pick a
[01:27:32] fight go go do whatever through this
[01:27:35] process of my life when you get to this
[01:27:37] point I'm man yeah and I still be in the
[01:27:39] car and I'll talk to my fiance this this
[01:27:41] it's jackass whatever whatever I now
[01:27:45] know that I can escalate a problem
[01:27:48] that's not really a problem I now now I
[01:27:52] have a a throttle
[01:27:55] and that's through
[01:27:57] self-examination is this a big is this a
[01:27:59] big deal is this something I need to
[01:28:02] approach with a level three engagement
[01:28:04] of like we're going at it right or just
[01:28:07] a level two engagement so now you have
[01:28:10] to be mature enough and I'm really big
[01:28:11] on maturity because I was never mature
[01:28:13] for so many years with age and knowledge
[01:28:16] you have to bring in maturity age
[01:28:19] doesn't mean you're mature it's going
[01:28:21] back in and say okay man look I'm at a
[01:28:23] point point my
[01:28:25] life what is smart if I do this I I can
[01:28:29] see the future I can see that if I do
[01:28:32] this this is going to happen I'm going
[01:28:34] to escalate this problem is this
[01:28:37] warranted there are some things that
[01:28:39] warrant me to escalate a problem yeah
[01:28:41] yeah and that's what I do now I take it
[01:28:43] through a process rate it yeah yes it
[01:28:46] goes on the rating program got it
[01:28:49] powerful um this is called the three
[01:28:52] truths I asked this question everyone at
[01:28:54] the end it's called three
[01:28:56] truths imagine uh it is your last day
[01:29:00] and you get to pick the day whenever you
[01:29:02] want you get to live as long as you want
[01:29:03] you pick the day but it's time for you
[01:29:06] to your body to go right you've created
[01:29:08] everything you want to create you've
[01:29:10] you've been at 99 percentile of
[01:29:12] potential for as long as you can live
[01:29:14] you've done it all you've checked off
[01:29:16] the list that everything that God says
[01:29:18] that you were supposed to do it's
[01:29:20] happened right written the books
[01:29:22] everything you want to do done but for
[01:29:24] whatever reason you've got to take all
[01:29:25] of your written word and videos and and
[01:29:28] and audio stuff that's out in the world
[01:29:31] you've got to take it with you MH but
[01:29:33] you get to write down on a piece of
[01:29:34] paper the three things you know to be
[01:29:35] true about all of your experiences and
[01:29:38] this is what you leave behind the three
[01:29:40] lessons or what I like to call the three
[01:29:42] truths what would you say are your three
[01:29:45] truths the first one is you are your own
[01:29:48] hero you are your own leader you are
[01:29:50] your own
[01:29:51] master and that is a big one because we
[01:29:55] idolize so many people mhm and we want
[01:29:58] to be them we want to be someone else
[01:30:02] and in doing that you lose all the
[01:30:05] potential of who you are you mimic you
[01:30:09] be them you are them you become them and
[01:30:13] you lose
[01:30:14] you and we look up to so many people in
[01:30:17] this world who will let us down we're
[01:30:19] humans I'm going to let you down you're
[01:30:21] going to let somebody down if you put
[01:30:23] them on a pet
[01:30:24] you then lose time when that person
[01:30:26] comes up and lets you down mhm you must
[01:30:29] hold yourself accountable and being your
[01:30:30] own hero that's what that does you make
[01:30:33] yourself so totally accountable for who
[01:30:37] you are you focus on you and only on you
[01:30:41] to become the best person you could be
[01:30:42] for others because we leave a lot on the
[01:30:45] table not searching who we are and then
[01:30:49] therefore you die not knowing your
[01:30:51] greatest potential right um that's one
[01:30:55] that's one the the the next one I would
[01:30:58] say is
[01:31:00] um the biggest one I would say is never
[01:31:04] pick the easy
[01:31:06] Road never never and it always goes back
[01:31:10] to kind of that the hero mentality never
[01:31:13] pick the easy Road ever in your life
[01:31:16] that is the one road that is Doom it is
[01:31:21] Doom if you want something
[01:31:24] like six minute abs all these different
[01:31:26] things people want it so fast you you
[01:31:29] may achieve what you
[01:31:31] wanted but you want the permanent fix
[01:31:34] the permanent fix comes from the Hard
[01:31:36] Road the Hard Road gives you permanent
[01:31:41] results the easy Road gives you the
[01:31:44] Quick Fix You will go back to where you
[01:31:46] started on the easy
[01:31:48] route that hard route is so permanent
[01:31:52] that it ends up callous s you everywhere
[01:31:56] everywhere you keep a six-pack forever
[01:31:58] you keep it you keep it because you know
[01:31:59] the work that goes into it
[01:32:02] yeah and the last one is when you get to
[01:32:05] where you want to go in life when you
[01:32:08] finally get there you finally reach that
[01:32:10] point and you're there and you're happy
[01:32:13] as hell realize
[01:32:17] this you're not there
[01:32:20] yet when you get that feeling that you
[01:32:25] be
[01:32:26] afraid right be truly afraid because now
[01:32:30] you start to do this slowly die slowly
[01:32:33] die either you're getting better or
[01:32:35] you're getting worse you're not staying
[01:32:38] the same yeah so when you get to where
[01:32:40] you think the journey is ended and
[01:32:42] you're sitting back and you're like I
[01:32:44] arrived I'm on Mount Everest I climb 29
[01:32:48] 029

[01:32:53] down down that damn Mountain as fast as
[01:32:55] you can and start climbing find the next
[01:32:58] climb find the next climb

[01:34:56] so I appreciate everything you do man
[01:34:57] and I'm excited about getting us out
[01:34:59] there um you're welcome my final
[01:35:02] question is what's your definition of
[01:35:05] greatness um you know what my definition
[01:35:07] of greatness is
[01:35:09] this it's not a definition it's an
[01:35:12] example this is greatness true
[01:35:15] greatness let's
[01:35:18] say
[01:35:20] that I'm the greatest tennis player of
[01:35:23] all time
[01:35:24] okay let's say that I hate
[01:35:27] tennis let say I'm the greatest tennis
[01:35:29] player of all time and I did 22 years I
[01:35:32] run all the grand slams I have all the I
[01:35:34] beat Roger feder I'm I am the best
[01:35:38] ever and we're having an interview and
[01:35:40] you're talking about my greatness what I
[01:35:43] achiev now I'm retired don't play tennis
[01:35:45] anymore haven't touched a racket in
[01:35:48] years and you're making me go back
[01:35:50] through my life you're kissing my butt
[01:35:52] about how great I am sure and I'm
[01:35:54] answering your questions every question
[01:35:56] I'm answering it I'm with you but in the
[01:35:59] back of my mind all I'm thinking about
[01:36:01] is all the times I could have won those
[01:36:03] matches that I lost by not bringing my
[01:36:06] best
[01:36:07] mindset you're
[01:36:09] haunted by all the opportunities that
[01:36:12] you missed by not bringing your best at
[01:36:15] that time when you could have won but
[01:36:17] you didn't win because you allowed life
[01:36:21] to interfere with that one shot when
[01:36:24] you're sitting there getting ready to
[01:36:25] serve for the match and your mind is not
[01:36:28] thinking about where that ball placement
[01:36:30] needs to be but thinking
[01:36:31] about your family this or this at work
[01:36:35] or that at work that's
[01:36:38] greatness greatness is your recall on
[01:36:41] every single shot that you missed
[01:36:43] throughout a 20-some year career every
[01:36:45] shot you can go back and say I was here
[01:36:49] this person was in the red shirt there
[01:36:51] greatness is being so aware of the
[01:36:55] time of life in the second that went by
[01:36:59] and you can recall like it was
[01:37:01] yesterday greatness is being able to go
[01:37:03] back there not making that same mistake
[01:37:06] again and being haunted by it that is
[01:37:10] greatness David ggins thanks man
[01:37:12] appreciate you man thank you powerful so
[01:37:14] I teach three rules of leadership number
[01:37:16] one 70% of leadership is how you lead
[01:37:19] yourself and these were the rules that I
[01:37:21] kind of created for myself and what I
[01:37:23] wasn't n doing in the past um what were
[01:37:26] you doing
[01:37:27] before uh I was living to do as I say
[01:37:30] and not as I do okay this is

## Plain Text (for processing)

the one piece I was missing was me Having the courage to face myself and once you do that on a daily basis it's not about to running most of us we live in a box and we don't want to go outside that box at all ever outside that box is all these possibilities of Life what we do is we shackle our mind we are a prisoner in our own mind that this is all I can do David Goggins is a retired Navy SEAL an ultramarathon Runner he also held a Guinness world record for the most pull-ups completed in 24 hours is one of the toughest men on the planet who's going to carry the boat I come from my father I have what he has and I didn't want to be him why he made fun of me why he beat the hell out of me my brother my mom it comes from a dark place an insecure dark dark place a good human being doesn't need to break anyone down all they do is want to build you up when you get to where you want to go in life you finally get there you finally reach that point and you're there and you're happy as hell realize this you're not there yet I'm so excited for you to check out this interview with David Goggins his mindset and his level of thinking just continues to inspire millions of people around the world and if you haven't heard yet David is speaking live at the summit of greatness in Los Angeles next month make sure to click the link in the description below to get your tickets to see him live along with Dr Joe despenza Cody Sanchez and more and without further Ado let's dive into this episode welcome everyone back to the school of greatness podcast we have the inspiring David gogin in the house good to see you man thank you very excited about this I first heard about you through Jesse isler's book uh living with a seal and he came on to talk about his experience and he actually didn't mention your name because you didn't want to be known right a few years ago right but now you're wanting to be known and you're putting your message out everywhere right and I'm just curious quickly why did you want to not be known then but now you do want to have your message out there well when Jesse wrote that book living with the seal I was uh I was about two or three weeks from getting out of the military so you know being a seal you know I didn't want to be mention David gogin in this book so the second the book popped I was retiring so the book came out November 15th or November 1 2015 and I uh retired November 2015 Goa so that's why that's the that's the biggest reason why and when did you start putting yourself out there doing interviews and talking about your message and you got on social media and started sharing videos when when did you decide to do that well I've been talking to people for several years and I wasn't really big on like my mindset is very different than most people yeah it's a mindset of um I don't want to be known too much I don't want too many looky lose in my life because that's where I gain my strength I gain my strength from a place of quiet and the more I got my story out there the more I realize it no longer be David Goggins The Quiet Man it'd be David Goggins the guy that's on Instagram answering this answering that cuz I'm also a guy that's always about is someone reaches out to me I'm not going to sit back and say oh you know whatever I'm going to reach back to you so it's going to take time out of me trying to gain strength and me trying to get where I need to go so that was a big deterrent for me to get on Instagram and all stuff I'm not I'm not big on social media anyway yeah but then I realized that I have a very God put me in a very interesting spot of life where he made hell my teacher he made hell my teacher and a lot of people don't understand that so I'm trying to give people a different thought process of life where failure hell disappointment discomfort is a great learning tool and many people don't understand that and a lot of people won't won't even understand this interview when we get done with it but it's these few moments in life that you have like for me I always talk about it Rocky one round 14 that one too many minute and 13 second clip of Rocky getting up when Apollo knocked him down that one clip when I was going through a very bad time in my life I saw what I wanted to be and it wasn't a guy that won it wasn't a guy that won everything he did it was a guy that kept getting up after being knocked down so I realized if that two minutes and 13 seconds changed my life so I was I saw something that I needed to be in the world I was living in maybe my story will give someone the two minutes and 13 seconds they need to change their life millions of people live in a very comfortable place that's fine don't listen to me a lot of people are looking for that 2 minutes and 13 seconds and I might be that person that's why I started sharing it yeah you talked about in the very beginning I like this um what did you say here your job is to be the best of your ability this will hurt the mission is not about making yourself feel better the mission is about being better and having a greater impact in the world and it sounds like you understanding the fact that you need to put yourself out there a little bit more right is going to reach more people and impact more people as opposed to always being quiet right is that what I'm hearing exactly I I I had to find a happy medium yeah you know I had to find a happy medium because what's the point like we all have a story and I believe that we're all we're all teachers we're all teachers and if you don't learn something and give back what like like like what you learned yeah what's the point of living you're wasting yeah you're wasting you you have all this knowledge of what you learn some people may think you're crazy some people may you know may put a title on you but it's it's it is you know it's it's those few people who are like you know what I need to hear that so you have to put yourself out there so was there Awakening for you in the last few years that said okay I'm not I'm not doing this enough I'm putting myself out there I'm not telling my story I'm I'm wasting certain aspects of My Life by not giving that message out there were a lot of emails that came in to me and I didn't realize you know when you live your life you don't know what it's doing to people cuz it's my life I didn't know my life was as bad as it was because it's my life it's what I went through I think it's like the norm it's the norm yeah that's what I did man but when I started getting these emails from people saying hey you know what you changed my life that part changed my life that part of your story changed my life and because I have so many different parts of my life that so many people resonate with different spots maybe it's the obese part maybe it's the bullying part maybe it's the learn disability part maybe it's the abusive parent part whatever it may be right so many people draw from my story and I started getting these emails and I was like God man you know and I'm a big believer in something more powerful than me I don't know what it is but I'm not the end all so I was like uh I got to start doing more if I'm touching these people's lives a few people here and there right maybe I need to go out here and do some more it's crazy story man I mean if you guys um haven't gotten the book you guys can pre-order the book this is actually a galley copy here printed out uh make sure you guys check this out can't hurt me master your mind and defy the odds and I was when I was read reading the the uh the first part of the book about your childhood I mean your father just seemed like was just so abusive physically I mean it's one thing to be emotionally abusive and another thing to be physically and when you have both it's like the perfect storm of like the makings for chaos in your life right and it just sounded like he was just nasty nasty and everything was your fault and you were always wrong and you weren't living up to a standard both you and your brother and your mom right and it was just constant physical abuse over and over I mean the story you just being bent over and him just like whipping you over and over and you just gasping for air I was just like oh my gosh this is crazy right um how did you deal with that how did you like overcome the constant physical and emotional abuse you know what it's all I knew mhm so when you're born to that it's all you know you I mean you know something's not right because in my mind at a young kid I could tell man you know the way I was processing things wasn't right right I mean I suffer from severe toxic stress and that was one of the big reasons why I started you know I had to learn disability my focus in life was way off I was afraid I was afraid of everything and when you have that kind of foundation um growing up and that's where you start life at is being beat being abused and also working all nights at a skating rink not going to school and you have a guy who's an alcoholic and the second he got drunk he got mad and so our house lived in fear yeah and the one thing that you can't ever get out of a kid's mind is your mom's mind like like your mom's face the terror of the terror of your mom's so you know you know I didn't care about my brother I didn't care about me but I saw this woman go from Mary Poppins the sweetest person on the planet Earth and when you see your mom start to transform to a shell to a person whose face becomes stoic a person who has no emotion and that changes a kid yeah and when you're young and you have to grow up so fast so about 8 years old my mind was of a of a 40 year olds at eight you know my family like life came at me and it makes your brain you know you know outside playing with kids you know you're trying to avoid getting beat you know you're avoiding all these things when you go home it's supposed to be safe right and you're getting beat again exactly and what's funny about that we lived in on on Paradise Road yeah lived on Paradise Road and it wasn't so Paradise it was anything but Paradise man you know once those doors shut yeah you know my dad gave everybody a different view of him he wore the nice tailor suits he smiled that's right your dad's amazing those doors shut man and the Devil Himself came out so it was it was it was rough and that's why my Foundation was so uh was so beaten down at at a young age so learning disability I grew up dyslexic so I can relate to that of just like constantly feeling stupid and insecure and you know I had a tutor my entire life horri till I finish college I had a tutor right second grade reading level when I was in eth grade it was just like a constant struggle emotionally and I took that outlet into sports and said I'm going to just train myself to be the best I can be in a place where I can learn something different right and pick up a different skill but with your with your learning disability with your dad beating you screaming at you emotionally challenging your mind with uh the racism you dealt with with um the different struggles you felt with bullies what was the CH the hardest obstacle to overcome from up until about 15 16 the hardest obstacle was myself I started realizing more and more and more that all these people were gone what was Haunting Me was me I can't control my dad I can't control the people calling me I can't control all these things but they were things that kept me down it started to become my reality my reality was what they made it out to be and I became the most important conversation you'll ever have with your life you know in your life is when you have yourself and my conversation was absolutely horrifying what were you saying to yourself I'm dumb I'm nobody my dad I mean my dad was great in mental Warfare a drunk insecure man will make everybody around him feel like hell yeah because he wants to give you no power and that's why he was so mean and my mom and myself and my brother CU he didn't want anybody to get above himh he want to keep you down low so when you're growing up with all this stuff all this hate and it wasn't the beatings I could take the beatings all day it was a mental torture so when at a young age your your parents put a dialogue in you of confidence or you're nobody so that voice in my head was I'm a loser and then it was confirmed when I got in school and in third grade I was falling behind they want to put me in in a special school yeah you know with kids who can't learn right then it was confirmed what you know what my dad was saying so that confirmed it then I started cheating so I started realizing you know what I'm taking the easy way out again yeah and it started snowballing from there now now the kids are calling me NE but it wasn't all the kids so what happens is you start to get this picture that everybody hates you because your reality becomes so so big that you don't I mean you can't see the clear picture it might have been three or four kids doing it over and over right but it was the whole town everybody hated me so start the world hates me that's right yeah and that's when it that's when it became toxic and that is where I became my worst enemy wow so those are the conversations you those are the conversations when did you start to realize that those conversations weren't supporting your life I was a so my mom was getting ready to get married and this guy came into our Liv name was wilmouth he came into our lives and like I always say whenever my life's getting better God will put another challenge in front of me he gets murdered oh man and we move back to Brazil so so we moved from this town this small town in Brazil and we moved to Indianapolis Indiana a lot more blacks a lot more different colors yeah weren't you living in New York at some point too I was born in Buffalo New York right and I went from Buffalo to Indiana and then from me Indiana to Indianapolis Indiana Indiapolis Indiana you know he got murdered when I was Indianapolis we went back Brazil went back to Brazil this when the racism started really cuz now I'm 16 so when I was first in Brazil I was 8 n kids don't care you're a kid I look different but kids don't care kids don't know but when I moved and I came back I'm no longer a kid so all the kids I grew up with I'm now different I'm different so there's about five black kids in my school and um the reality came when I came out one day and on my car was spray painted they were going to kill you oh my gosh in in Brazil in Brazil in Portuguese no no my fa Brazil Indiana go braz brail I was like oh you went to Brazil I was like no no Brazil Indiana Brazil Indiana from to Brazil Indiana got it so I uh was in Brazil Indiana and about 10 minutes from brazili indana is a small town called Center Point Indiana uhhuh in C Point Indiana is was at that time a huge Hub of the KKK wow wow in 1995 the clan March the Fourth of July parade and I don't know if the pictur is in I don't know if any pictures are in there but if not there's a picture in the book yeah in 1995 10 minutes from my house of crosses being burnt 10 minutes from your house 10 minutes from my house wow so when you have all this negativity growing up and now you're cheating and you're doing this and you and your dad beats you and you know your your mom's fiance gets murdered and tragedy after tragedy the tragedy and then you come to this and your mom's working three jobs you know she's not home at all she never saw one report card in mine she didn't know how bad off I was in school she was hustling trying to make money and I was the man of the house lying sneaking around not going to school cheating right everything I could and um so I I I walked out of school one day and saw this Niger we're going to kill you on my car and I went in to get the principal there's several incidents like this that happened I went get the principal and the principal he he didn't have anything he he couldn't give me any advice and I didn't want to tell my mom about it cuz my mom was already bothered by my dad beating her down and now her fiance got murdered so I didn't want to last thing on her mind she's like I've dealt with this my whole life right I didn't want to bother with anything man so I kept everything away from her so I'm in the crow wash trying to trying to scrub this stuff off and I got home and so happens two weeks later she gets a note from school and the says your son is going to fail he's not going to graduate and she's like what is this and I had to come clean with my mom of all the years of me cheating of all the bullying of all this and all that and she was such in a bad spot in her life that the best thing she could do was like Hey you know you're you're going to fail you're going to fail School wow and I I was like my God man like you know she she was in a dark place and I was in a dark place and we were kind of on our owns in in the same house but living different lives and I realized that this time of my life she was a great mom but I was on my own and that's when a real big change happened for me so I said I'm going to join the military this a 6 17 17 you know I wanted to go into the uh delayed entry program MH and I went to take the asbab test and I cheated so that's what you knew that's what I did you're good so I got my friend cuz I walked to recruiter's office and recruiter says hey you got to take this ASVAB test second I heard test I was like man oh hang on a second I can't test this in my life man I'm going to go can I come back tomorrow yeah yeah so I come back and the uh the the recruiter starts handing these tests out I'm like great I'm going sit by my boy I'm going copy off my boy he had a different test than I did so I couldn't copy off him and that's when the light bulb hit on so I failed this test several times I felt it twice I actually felted it I felt it twice in the third time I said Mom I need help wow and she said um we don't have much money but we can afford a tutor for one hour a week for six months because this is my last time taking a test and so I had to learn so I I had a third grade reading level I'm a junior in high school yeah so I had six months to learn all this stuff and I only had a tutor for one hour a week so basically what happened was she would come in for an hour and I I wasn't picking it up any of it I couldn't retain anything and it was so much to learn that overwhelmed me so basically what happened was I realized I had to go by the store and buy spiral notebooks and I had to literally write down every single thing repeatedly like so what may take you an hour to learn it took me hours 68 n 10 hours I to write the same thing down simple stuff simple stuff I hear you man so I started memor that's my life I I had to memorize yeah what I so I didn't really learn it I could just recall it from writing it down so many times that on page 71 I remember seeing that yeah and that's how I did it and I ended up passing that test crazy and I got in the military so it's crazy yeah what was the greatest lesson your mom taught you growing up honestly the greatest lesson she ever taught me is a lesson that she she doesn't know how much she taught me because she wasn't much in a teaching mode my dad took her soul but what I did as a young kid is I observed everybody I wasn't really smart in the books yeah but I was real smart when it came to life yeah and I was able to sit back and watch her mistakes I was able to see how she struggled through life and how I don't want to struggle through life and I was able to see she never picked me up the biggest thing she did for me and this is honest to God truth and she doesn't even know she did it when I would bust my ass when I would fail yeah when I was at the bottom of the sewer she never picked me up she never gave me that cookie and said hey son you know it's going to be okay never she didn't have time for that and sometimes she gets upset when I talk about my past because it it pains her out to be not the best mom if I had any kind of mom in that kind of environment I would have never made it because she forced me for whatever reason she forced me to get better figure this out or you're going to be a statistic wow and this is something that she didn't sit down and tell me I realized this this is the world that is in front of me and what most people do is they see this world and they look at it as an excuse to get out of it yeah I started looking at it as this is the ultimate training ground for the rest of my life mhm I have all these valuable lessons cuz if you look out in the world right now today it's not a nice place but I'm very prepared for it yeah you are I'm prepared for it I'm prepared for all the failure coming my way I'm prepared for everything my way and that's the biggest lesson that she taught me by not teaching me by never saying it's going to be okay matter of fact she told me the exact opposite life sucks that's what she knew it was the truth that was her reality that was her reality yeah and so I saw that and so I started at that point in my life I have a lot more failures as you see in that book but I started down the road of instead of the path of you know least resistance I started choosing the path of most resistance to prepare myself for the journey that was coming my way wow and most kids don't prepare themselves for the most resistance they want to get out of things they want to get out of things get off the hook don't put in the extra reps right they want the easiest path to get to the top right right exactly huh you know I I I look at my life is like you and here you talk about like really diving into pain and like embracing pain and finding looking for the pain right and I think there's like a there's a there's a safe pain and then there's probably an unsafe pain of just like jumping off a building and you know whatever trying to land on 20 floors or something it's probably not the safe way to do things but doing 200 miles uh of endurance running is like a different way of pain looking at pain um and that's what I've been looking for my whole life is like finding the pain and I talk about like do something every day that that's painful right in a good structured environment you've been doing that for the last couple years now it's like you work out every day you haven't missed a day and do it for the last 20 years of my life 20 20 years are years no 20 some years of my life 20 every day you work out so I used to take one day off a week uhhuh I used to take one day off a week for the body recover right makes sense but that one day off was an active recovery day where I would get on a trainer and ride for like two hours wow but at a at a Zone one heart rate very low heart rate and I replace the carbohydrates in my body while I Rod because the best way to recover for me is to do something at a very low heart rate because Therefore your blood's flowing through your body yeah as your blood's flowing through your body refuel it with the nutrients because then your blood's flowing the nutrients is going through all your cells in your body all that glycogen is now flowing at a low heart rate so it's not burning it it's refueling it yeah so every Sunday used to be that and it kind of snowballed into as human beings We Believe like so many people before I give them a workout plan they're talking about recovery everybody everybody that hears me speak they want to go straight to recovery work out first huh work out first before you talk to me about recovery how to recovery yeah work out first we are always looking for like whenever I talk to people people take my words and they and they and they put it in a way to where they want to feel comfortable this guy you know they they they want to put you in a box they want to put a title on you no you're putting a title on me to make yourself feel better about yourself if you read this book of mine and you see where I came from this person was th this person was not built this this person was not made by God mhm this person sorry this person was built I made this person I made this person person by diving into to the insecurities that life gave me cuz now they're yours they're yours to own if you're not smart call yourself dumb it's okay cuz you are but take that not as putting yourself down if you're fat call yourself fat I used to be 300 lbs we we want to talk so soft to ourselves we're looking for that recovery day and that recovery day is everything in your life everything in your life is a recovery day we're looking for it it's not coming it's not coming get over that recovery day and that's the mentality I took with me and what happened through that process was all the frivolous things of life started to float away I used to tell people lies so they would like me CU I was so insecure when you start to build yourself up and start to have the one thing that we don't have is confidence yeah real authentic Confidence from hard work everything else goes away you no longer look to other people for your self-esteem validation yeah you now know I walk in the room now and I know that hours and years and decades I put into David Goggins that's something it's not on the wall it's not a trophy on the wall it's not a m around your neck it is actually a feeling in your heart and people go why don't you ever smile I don't have to yeah yeah I do have a stoic look in my face I'm I'm a very focused person but the feeling I have in my soul and in my heart that's why I don't need to smile I don't need to smile I don't need you to look at me and say oh my God you look happy cuz half of us aren't happy we're we're giving you something that we think you want to see I don't do that anymore I don't care how you perceive David gogins because through my journey I figured out the one piece I was missing I thought it was Cars I thought it was women I thought it was I thought it was money I thought it was everything the one piece I was missing was me Having the courage to face myself and once you do that on a daily basis it's not about the running we're people going you about working out where I got my work ethic from was the hours I had to spend learning this when you sit down and you're not smart and you have a disability yeah and you still want to be in the top of your class I didn't want to get by when I realized that I can learn through hard work and I can beat the Victorian in the school but I got put in 10 hours more a day than he does you know what kind of strength comes from that when you're sitting down that guy that that Val vior study for an hour and you know I caught you I caught you and I am dumb but I have the work ethic to catch you that's where David gagas got really invented yeah was at a kitchen table with 20 spiral notebooks that were empty and then 3 months later down yeah they were full and when you can go through that I still have in my storage unit you go through these spiral notebooks of your life and you realiz this is how I learned this is unbelievable there's no miles it's not about the miles it's that having a discipline every day to say for me to learn this one math problem it's going to take me 10 hours wow and that's where it and you realize through hard work you can do you can outwork anybody mhm how badass they are but that's the part people don't want to dive into yeah when someone's lacking confidence in themselves what's the answer you would give them if they're like how do I gain more confidence it starts with yourself man you got to start diving into those things that you are afraid of you don't gain confidence by going to the spot that makes you feel good it's could be a false reality in the second life gives you that challenge all you want to do is go back to what made you confidence or or or or what gave you confidence is that happy spot no what gives you confidence what gave me confidence was spending years at a kitchen table trying to learn how to read and write on my own realizing I can't learn the way you learn I can't but I can learn what gives you confidence not being afraid it's overcoming the fear Isis stutter severely bad so right now I don't know how many people are going to watch this you know what gives me confidence is know I no longer care if I sin and start stuttering to you yeah that's what gives me confidence is facing these things overcoming them and maybe not overcoming them every day but facing them and facing them and fac them pretty soon like this you know what man this the word it's at it's not in that comfort zone it's in the discomfort zone is where my confidence is getting built mhm that's where it's getting built but people want they want an easier answer yeah there has to be an easier way there's not I'm sorry I searched for it my entire life you cheated you lied I lied I did everything and I still felt empty m i coach a lot of people nowadays billionaires who call me on the phone and say man I'm still missing something it's because they did what they were good at and they have this beautiful family two three houses cars everything has everything to world on the outside looking in like my God man how can you be unhappy I walk around with the backpack with all my stuff in it and no car right and I walk around happiest person in the world have nothing happy as hell it's because I found out the whole key to life it's not in all that you have to face yourself so many people live to be 100 years old and they die miserable having everything because they never examined I call it my live autopsy H you never examine this happiness peace Enlightenment it's all up here man it's all up here and I start talking like this people man you know I don't know it's the truth man yeah it is true it's all up here you just got to be will to go and face it and that's the hard part what's your biggest insecurity today I I'm not to be arrogant I don't have one what was the last one you had and when was that the last one I had was probably um still me me still living because I I always talk about I I pay rent so we live we used to live in a $7 a month place when I was growing up this in Buffalo or is this this is in Indiana so like we had a lot of money in Buffalo MH and when my mom left my dad we went to nothing for a period of time before she got on her feet right and that's $7 a month place used to be it was my it was who I was I was no one I was in a sewer my mom was there I had nothing and you always feel like you have nothing I I achieved so much I was a Navy SEAL I've gone through Ranger school I've gone through Delta Force selection training I I I done so much I I run 200 miles pullup records everything learned to read and write became pretty intelligent and I still was like man what is wrong with me it wasn't until I got real sick and I talked about in the last chapter of that book I got real sick and I was about um 38 years old I'm 43 now and my life got real quiet I I went from running 205 miles in 39 hours to I couldn't get out of bed the doctors couldn't figure out what was wrong with me but once again it was the best thing ever happened to me why is that in that moment when my whole life changed I went from a guy who worked out every day trained every day to a guy who couldn't get out of bed my life was taken from me the one thing that kept me going was my training now you didn't have that I didn't have anything now you just had to sit alone alone and not train and that's what changed me and that's when I realized I hadn't thought hadn't taken time to think about what I done in my life you hadn't reflected yet I had reflected i' done all these things but there was no Finish Line I still believe that but you must have time to reflect yeah I was just going I wouldn't even I finished a race of life and I wouldn't even receive my medal I go on you're like on to the next I get in the car and I go you won't even take the medal gone don't care about like I'm not going to waste an hour sitting around for this ceremony most people sit around and that's what they like they they need the ceremony if I accomplished something validation I haven't done anything let's go let's go let's go I'm just getting started I'm just getting start right when I started figuring out life that I was leaving so much in the tank I call my 40% rule yeah I was leaving so much in the tank once I realized my God man I was this dumb fat kid being bullied and now I'm 180 lb person lost 106 lbs in less than three months learn to read learn to do this learn to do that I was like I need more I was fueling my mind with everything and I never took time to say my God you came from this hell and you're here so those insecurities and this how I explain it the best way SEAL training became pretty hard and a lot of guys weren't getting through it so they designed a seal pep prep program like a boot camp for the boot camp that's right yeah and it was two months in my last two years before I retired from the military they sent me there to train these kids wow to get ready for 19 20 old young kids so when they get to Navy SE training man they were physical studs they were running swimming I mean they were they were hybrids wow but they get the buds and the same amount of people would quit why is that this is why we were training bigger stronger faster quitters H it's not about not the mind that's right we weren't diving into the sewer everybody's got a story we don't share it on social media we share our nice life on social media we have we all have a dungeon I'm just willing to talk about mine yeah most of us not will to talk about it I want to talk about my dungeon I wasn't getting into the dungeon of these guys Minds I wasn't building that so-called mental toughness mental toughness isn't something that you sample it's something that you live in every day so when something hard would happen to these kids like in hell week it would draw on something that made them very insecure and they look for Comfort whenever heart hardess comes and you don't know what it is it may be different for you than it is for me but you go back to your insecurities and then you go back to insecurities you then look for Comfort within those insecurities and we all look for that cookie that your mom used to give you when you were sad when you were sick we look for our wife or our husband we look for Comfort it's in those moments you must retrain your mind to think differently in hell I wasn't training them to do that why weren't you training them I wasn't training myself to that because at that time I was doing what I was told these guys need to meet a standard physical standard a physical standard the physical standard is not what they need to meet it's a mental standard you must meet in life so going back to when I was sick I was hitting the physical standards I wasn't meeting the mental standards the mental standard is you must know how far you've come wow I wasn't I I had come 8,000 miles from where I started but if you never know that you're still in the $7 a month place when I was sick I was able to slow it down and reflect back on my entire life and in that bed when I thought I was dying because that story is long that that sick portion of my life is long I didn't care if I died or lived wow cuz I was for the first time in my life happy wow and at peace cuz I reflected back on where it started you said well I have come a long way that's right and no one saved me it wasn't like someone came down here and guided me through life when you figure this out on your own the amount of pride and dignity and self-respect you have that's why I walk around the streets with a backpack and just like I don't need anything else yeah you figure it out by going inside yourself by callousing over the victim's mentality you're always a victim even if you have everything in life until you realize what you've achieved you have to first realize what you've achieved in my mom has accomplished so much in her life since my father but she hasn't done that one step really she doesn't acknowledge it and reflect back she continues to go back to the dungeon of her past life and live in that space and live in that space versus Liv in the space that she's in now and reflecting back on my God this is what I've done with my life so have you talked to her about this we talk about it all the time and you have to be willing to go there you have to be willing to really go there not not surface I don't I don't live on the surface of anything yeah surface is what got me where I was at it got me from 175 PBS to 300 lb telling everybody I'm good I don't I don't give a damn I'm good no they're they're Hollow words a lot of us speaking Hollow words I used to speak in Hollow words I don't do anymore everything that comes in my mouth has substance is real and we all have these feelings in our bodies and our minds and our souls I act on mine a lot of us who are afraid of something we allow our minds to choose the path of least resistance so we go a different route I'm afraid of something is me you must con that you must do that yeah you have to go that way and most of us don't understand that mentality we go left and we wonder why we haven't fulfilled something in our lives is because we continue to take the journey that is mapped out and how I look at it is I I I talk in life like a lot of us in life want to take the four-lane highway that has road maps and all this other stuff on it man tells you where to go g gas stations the next 10 miles up you're going to see a McDonald's a Crackle Barrel yeah it's the easy route very few of us want to go to the right side that Cracker Barrel is that Midwest life that's right that's right that's right from Ohio it's all about it man Indiana cracker bar everywhere dude that's amazing bringing back memories um this is powerful because I've been telling people this I've been living that way unknowingly my whole life of like whatever the thing is I'm afraid of when I was in high school I started doing those things right I was just like I'm sick and tired of feeling afraid right so I need to do the things that scare me the most that's right you know I've talked about this a lot on the podcast Tiffany's heard me these share these stories but I was afraid to talk to girls when I was a teenager I was afraid of uh dancing I was afraid of like singing and playing music in front of people I was afraid of all these different things and so I said I'm going to do this I'm going to give myself a challenge every single day until the fear goes away that's right and I feel like that's what more of us should be doing I'm hearing that that's what you how you live your life that's all it is man and it helps me feel so much more confident when you overcome that fear of saying this doesn't have control over me anymore that's right it's like you can be at so much more peace it's 100% your life most of like like for instance I never thought in my wildest dreams I could be a Navy SEAL it's until you open your mind open-mindedness creates that we all shut down our mind like for instance when I broke the pull-up record everybody around me who heard the pull-up record was 4,020 pull-ups that's the first thing they did oh my God 4,000 and 24 hours or was yeah it's 4,020 pull-ups in 24 hour period y the first thing I did versus closing my mind you're like oh my God that's crazy I went and got a pen say how many is that every minute exact every hour every second instead of taking life and making it out to be this grandio thing start breaking it down start breaking it down and most of us we live in a box and we don't want to go outside that box at all ever outside that box is all these possibilities of Life what we do is we shackle our mind we are a prisoner in our own mind that this is all I can do this is all I'm good at and we we we take away the possibilities of you could be this you could be that you could be all these things and I never thought at 300 lbs I could be n seal wow so if my mind was Shackled me and you would never meet there' be no book right there be no book right there be nothing so what people understand is that they live for themselves not knowing that you have the power within yourself to change millions of lives Yeah by face of Life by facing yourself and through that I I would die never knowing that I had the power to change millions of lives and what haunts me the most people ask me what what haunts you the most what haunts me the most is that if I would have died at 300 lb let's say I was 75 years old I got to heaven and God has a chart like that on everybody's life God knows all let's say that I don't care what you believe in doesn't matter I'm not judging anybody but let's say my thing is God you get to heaven I'm 300 lbs I sit down I was a cockroach terminator my whole life and we're sitting down just like this you're God and I'm David and he gives me that chart and he says look at this now look at this chart and on theart it has all these different things but my name's on it but these things aren't me I was going to change the world I was going to I was going to set records I was going to be a Navy SEAL I was going to be all these things in the military that I accomplished you're going to get the VFW award you going to be honored here honored there I'm like God I was this isn't me like it says David gogins I was an Eco laab guy I spray for cockroaches and I'm 300 lb it said here I'm 185 it says here I got a a bachelor's and a masters it says all these things and God goes no that's who you were supposed to be wow my biggest fear in life is if there is a final resting place in this world and there's a final judgment and you talk to something much bigger than you I don't want to sit down and have a conversation with someone with something that says you're in heaven this is what you should have been on Earth and are you really in heaven now or are you in hell thinking about how much I left on the table for fear for not willing to go over the wall and over the next wall and over the next wall so in my mind I believe that and God knows all at least I believe that I want God to be up there right now as we're speaking writing stuff down saying my God he exceeded even my expectations that's how I live my life I now know that there is no cap on the human mind there's no cap we cap it ourselves wow is there a cap on the human body that's right is there one there I I don't believe so mhm because one thing I found out was I didn't for several years I gave myself a way out when you were 300b I was 300 lb when I was all way up till I was 24 years old I would climb a mountain I fall back down I start climbing I fall back down for the first 24 years of my life I went to my first hell week my second hell week and then my third hell week came in still training and the CEO Captain Bowen looked at me I'm on crutches I'm all jacked up he says hey this is your last time you're going to go through buds it I had several stress fractures I had had double pneumonia I was jacked up and he gave me a few months to heal he said this is your last time going through I shouldn't even let you go back through wow I started Navy SEAL training with stretch fractures stretch fractures not shint that's hard to finish stretch fractures starting the hardest training aru the hardest train in the world with stretch fractures and this is when I started to not put a cap on the body if the mind is there every morning I would wake up at 3:30 in the morning 4:00 in morning go to my dive cage go in there before anybody saw me I get duct tape and I would tape from my for foot all the way up to the midd of my calf and I would put two black socks on and so I ran not using the pivot oh my gosh and I ran my hip flexors so for the first 45 minutes to an hour I was in absolute excruciating pain but what motivated me through that whole process was the fact that this kid came from that I'm in the hardest training in the world in the worst shape of my entire life what if I can graduate amongst these studs wow all these guys around me are studs they're stallions they're Gladiators in my class they're all healthy most of them they're not broken like this they may have some you know everybody's sick going to that training but if I can graduate it would change everything for me if I can start the hardest train in the world broken and graduate so my mind fed off of that you are now from the weakest man you are now the hardest man to ever live if you can do this if you can do this life is one big mind game yeah and you're playing it with yourself is it true I don't care it got me through the hardest training starting out broken m where most people quit I had just started wow and when you take that mindset and you learn to flip that around that's what made me powerful and my body followed and three months later my stretch fractures were healed by running on them calcifying it just like I never had them since I'm 43 years old wow I ran 7,000 miles in 2007 haven't had a stretch fr sense and I'm not saying to do that I'm just saying that when the mind and the body connect and you didn't and you don't give yourself a way out the only way out for me at that time was death wow I'm going to be a Navy SEAL or I'm going to die or I'm going to die trying yeah period and my body said Roger that we're going to get you through this so when the Mind gives it no way out way your body says okay okay I believe you now I have to heal I'm going to figure this out with you we're going to do this it's going to be the the worst part of your life but we're you're going to survive we're going to survive wow and as you hear in that 100 mile race I did I started figuring out more and more and more and more about at the other end of suffering is a life that no one and I'm not talking about go out there and kill yourself don't take these words and flip them and say oh my God no it just be uncomfortable I call suffering don't physically injure yourself yes not saying that and then be out for six months that's no good that's no good I'm not saying I'm not saying do what I did yeah I was in a spot that life forced me I had a choice I had a choice to be this guy or the guy that's in front of you I had choices I chose this path and you're still choosing it I'm still choosing you go back to that guy any moment cuz I found out I found out something with those stress fractures I found out something through facing all these things I found out a whole another world which is why I walk around with all my stuff in the Black Backpack wow I found a whole another way a whole another way of no matter how far you get in life you have to be able to go back to scratch in your mind at a moment's notice you can never get so far beyond scratch what that means is when you accomplish something in life if you want to go back to scratch and go back to that $7 a month place where I once lived and visit that place for a long period of time if you were here when you went back to scratch you would now be here scratch is what makes you better scratch friction obstacles create growth there's no friction when you're this far up in the game anymore you think there is that's right when you chieve so much the friction is is is minor cuz why I'm sore I'm going to get a massage today mhm I'm hungry I'm going to eat today the refrigerator is always full so your Comforts are now so your discomfort is now very minuscule to your discomfort back here in the $7 month place so you have to go back to the total discomfort to then raise your level of where you're at now I'm not saying stay there and stay there visit visit it and then you raise your level take a trip that's right yeah always take day trips yeah don't stay there that's right but take a day trip take a day trip so when you complete some massive obstacle and challenge whatever the adversity that you force upon yourself cuz these are all curated experiences for yourself that you're scratching constantly what happens now since this was 5 years ago you would just leave you wouldn't take the medal you would just go onto the next what happens now do you take you know a day to reflect a moment 10 minutes like how does the process work and then how do you get back to visiting the $7 uh you know place you lived in now I don't have to go back and visit it I don't have to think about it it lives with me now every day of my damn life that feeling that I had to go back and think about I found a way just have it how did you it's constantly there I have a selft talk I have a selft talk it's called My Cookie Jar mhm and it's a constant reminder of David guy every day of my life I believe in quiet there's no growth outside of quiet the the world's too noisy your mind needs quiet for you to find who you are people ask what's my purpose why am I here you're not going to find it nowadays unless you lock yourself in a quiet room in your mind and find it it's too noisy for me I could be in a busy Street in New York City horns home and I'm walking around with like nothing it's me and myself in a quiet spot and when you are constantly reflecting on who you are where you've been the journey you've gone through the Journey you can continue going through the feeling is always there you don't allow the world to pull you so fast that you forget you don't allow yourself to pull you so fast that you forget it's not about staying in that moment it's about you want to get to the point where that feeling follows you like breathing becomes a part of your life part of your DNA but it's made like these CES on my hands right now they're made yeah they are now on my brain this is now a part of me it's a daily process a part of me and how I go back to a $7 a month place all the time is now I go out and I dig fire line I'm a wildland firefighter I don't need to do it mhm I'm a 43 year old man I I work with 27 year old kids yeah I'm a rookie every day I'm a rookie it feels like and why do you do it that's why I do it man there's a story I'm going to tell you about why I do it so I make I have a good living now for me where I'm at in my life I was out on a fire in Colorado and we were digging fire line on this like 50% like it was like on the side of a dad gone Mountain yeah and we're trying to keep the fire from moving and we're digging this fire line 14 in or my fault 18 in wide three miles long 12 of us digging and it is the hardest work you make $12 an hour wow okay nothing you set up your shop like when you're done digging you pretty much lay down you go to sleep and you get up you dig some more really this happens for two weeks long what do you digging it's like a hole you're a line so you're trying to get down to to a mineral sore so so you're trying to get down to the to the Earth so so that if that fire is moving it can't burn dirt really so you're moving fuels got it you know so so not only are you digging you're cutting down trees it's hard work but the moral story is I'm 43 don't need to do it at all this is why I do it you're making money I'm making money I'm I I I I have a good life I don't need to do it everybody ask me why I do it this is why this 21 year old kid was out there and he wanted a pair of running shoes so all you want was a pair of running shoes 60 70 100 bucks whatever you know easy for us shoes he looked up at the mountain that we had been on for days digging this fire line and he said that'll take me five or six hours of work to buy those shoes so I'm not going to buy them it's the perspective of life that perspective of life right there of that is the value that we lose when things start to come so easy in life it's the perspective that 21y old had we looked about that mountain and thought he looked at his hands he looked at the at the amount of hours of pulling that palasi that that tool and raking that ground and and then cutting those trees and moving them and that hours of work he looked at his feet and said these old shoes would do it's that perspective in life that we lose and that's that story to most people may not mean anything it's that story I always want to have in my life you cannot lose perspective of where you've come in life yeah so true we were in uh Guatemala was it this year or last year last year we were in Guatemala last year we we support a a charity called pensil the promise that builds schools for kids who live in poverty all around the world and every year I take a trip to just see where our efforts are being you know felt and and being and being made and uh these are the poorest places in Guatemala LA and Ghana places that they have nothing there's no Schools they're little Villages they live on dirt Huts everything right and we go and we build these schools we actually the The Villages build them themselves we just fund the experience and they Empower we Empower them to do it um so that they take ownership of it right but I'll be there for a few days and watch these kids so happy with just like a pencil right just so happy to just like have their family around and they'll go and they'll show us their huts and like they're just so happy to have community and then I'll fly back and go through Beverly Hills right over here and I'll see like these Mansions you know I live right next to it and I'm just like it gives me so much perspective of like you don't need to have all these things to find peace and joy and connection and intimacy and all these and all these other things that we want you don't need these big mansions and to live in this nice place you know I like living here but it's not like it's perspective for me is what keeps me motivated as well that's right to to keep doing the right things to keep showing up keep working hard and I think it's right most of us miss that perspective in life we get so far away from reality so far and the reality is man when I was 7 years old8 years old all I wanted was a 99 cent Quarter Pounder from Hardies I know right and that made me happy as hell some curly fries man that's it man that's it yeah the thing is a lot of us have been um conditioned or some of us grew up with wealth or grew up with Comfort right so we're conditioned that way and we're grow up expecting now that things should come a lot easier right that's a damn shame and we get we get uh frustrated when we don't get it right quickly quickly yes yeah and I'm always talking about delayed gratification like the longer I can wait to receive gratification that's right the more fulfilled I am I'm a person so when I got sick like I did um I actually had to quit this race called badwater yeah 135 miles through Death Valley it was 2014 I got real real bad I pulled out of the race at Mile 50 I went to the emergency room and the doctor like you know we can't find this we can't find that we know what's wrong with you when I got in that bed so this is the crazy thing about gratification long term I'm able to watch grass grow by finding out this I sat there couldn't run a half a quarter mile couldn't get out of bed the only thought I had in my mind I I pull out that race I told myself I'm GNA go back to badw waterer one day and rent it I'm GNA win the race haven't been back since haven't been back since 2019 I'm not saying I'm win it I'm just now in the shape to go back wow haven't w a 100 mile race since 2014 wow because I've been that sick I'm just now imagine the gratification I'm going to get by getting to the startline that race and what if I can win it be pretty sweet pretty sweet four or five years yeah imagine that of having that kind of of having that kind of self-discipline to every day wake up and having these setbacks where I can't even run a mile wow but I'm thinking about running 135 I can't run one mile but I'm thinking about running 135 and with that process guess what happens sooner or later you can run 10 miles may take a year but it gives you more and more hope that possible and I'm at the point now where guess what it's right around the corner wow most people in that time frame in that in that in that mindset I can't run anymore it's over no it's just going to take a little bit longer you have to turn the negative into a positive because at the end of it all if you can sit back and wait if you can wait 6 7 8 9 10 12 years when you get to that point when you finish that's the feeling for 12 years I say I say wa 12 years to get there that's what keeps you going is you got to feel I want I'm doing it for one second years of pain for one second one second think about it you cross the finish line it's over one second most people do that and then one second isn't what they thought it would be and then they're pissed and upset and they keep going on to the next because they never reflect back on what they did it's not the 1 second it's the 12 years yeah it's the 12 years that I want it's not the race MH it's the 12 years while you did it it's not the winning not the it's not what place you got no but most of us focus on right oh I got to win this that's right if I don't I'm going to be upset I would achieve all my athletic goals for years and then 10 minutes later be the angriest person in the world so angry and frustrated nasty with people and I would delay my gratification for years to achieve what I wanted right and I never understood that either being a perfectionist is the worst thing that can happen to a person you never live like when I lost that 106 PBS in like 2 and a half months whatever it took me that was the biggest trophy in my entire life I didn't care if I graduate Navy still training I didn't care what I just accomplished in that time frame it's massive yeah I don't know there was no trainer I I I there was no like and what's funny about this we talk about mental toughness nowadays it's like the biggest crave when I grew up it was just suck it up yeah it was just make it happen yeah you had to figure out it's it was called figure it out man and all these all these nuggets that I gained along the way that's what was about it went about the Trident it went about all those de on medals it was about any of that and that's why I hate even talking about being a seal you know I miss the stories why you talk about it didn't Define me the journey getting there was harder than going through it yeah you know so that's the whole thing about life man it's it's that Journey that that makes you who you are yeah and and as opposed to focusing on did I win or not right what did I gained from the last 12 years right and so when you finish now you think about how how long do you reflect back on the effort it took to accomplish that race or a long time what's days time weeks years you reflect on it I reflect back now there's times now where I will reflect back on my first 100 mile race still today still today and it'll give me the same exact feeling because what I did in that first race when I was undertrained I did it on four days notice I hadn't run more than I think 20 miles the whole year and I and I did it to raise money for his foundation to you know to try to get in the bad water what I had to pull out of myself on that last that's where that book limit the seal kind of originated Jesse ller saw me at this race he was racing too yeah but he did it as a team right you did alone I did it alone and that's what I talking with people about man I spent so much time people always like why do you run so much you know you you you know try to get in shape no the things I do in life most of life you're alone you may have a whole support crew around you but up here you're alone most of the stuff I do I'm training for that one those moments those moments when I was at Mile 70 and I had 30 more miles to go and I had I crapped up my back and peeing blood down my leg at 30 miles to go there's only so much someone cheering can do for you right when you start to dive back in the cell of your mind and you're pulling out all these all these tactics all these mental tactics to get through this 30 miles when you're in the worst shape of your life and no one's coming to save you and you get through that I I want to go back there like when I got doing that race I laid in the tub and my ex-wife helped me get up the stairs and I'm laying in this tub and Coca colola is coming out of me just look like dirt and she and you know she's a nurse and she's like she's freaking out and she puts the shower on me and I'm looking at her and all I want to do is call the race director up of badwar said I qualify for the race and she's thinking we got to go to the hospital so you know she's she's calling my mom and my mom has a doctor friend of hers who's over and they're freaking out and I said everybody just shut up wow shut up I'm in the worst pain in my entire life and no one would ever understand this no one when you've gone that deep inside yourself and all those feelings of pain that I had I was in the worst pain of my life ever and some people think man you're just crazy no when you've when you've done that and you figured out so much on your own and all that pain and discomfort I had that tub laying there passing out everything was confirmation of what I just figured out I just figured out the code I figured out a code a code that many people aren't looking for and I want it to be numb I I want that feeling this was confirmation this was like a scientist's notes MH the notes were here the notes were all this feeling it was a confirmation and no one at that time could understand what I just done I cracked the code the human potential in myself and I was still like oh my God like this is unbelievable what I just did so it's that quiet place wow it's that place by yourself it's those hours and years and decades by yourself in the grip of life when life has you by the throat and choking you out and you're sitting there calm because you're trying to figure it out you're not panicking you're not quitting you're not throwing in the towel you're saying there's a way around this and when you figure it out when life has you gripped in a vice and you can figure that out that's when you overcome that's when you overcome and that's why that one moment for me in that tub I didn't want anyone to take away from me wow this is crazy man I love this do you have any fears today I do have a lot of fears today um but it's hard for me to call them fears anymore I don't use that word anymore they're almost like it's another challenge yeah because anything that makes me feel that fear feeling is going to get overcome you go do it it's going to get conquered it it that is that's almost like fear is my ultimate guide of where you're supposed to be going where I'm supposed to be going it's my Ultimate Guide so I what's the big what's the big challenge then for you then the biggest challenge for me is always going I want to be comfortable you want to be comfortable you want to sleep in a nice bed and relax normal human being you want to chill out yeah I want and the time is going to come it's time for everybody to get civilized the worst thing in life that happens to a man is that get civilized or a woman anybody because you lose the hunger for life you you you you think you've arrived and once you have a I've arrived mentality that's my biggest fear is I get to the point where I I'm at that point where life has come to me and I have that feeling about I've arrived I now know my life for what I know it to be is over even though that's where Comfort is and everything else I found the most life in the most uncomfortable places in the world I was the most David the the the goggin that I invented because David gogin was weak I never want to get rid of gogin the guy I created that weak person that that that used to be the guy I created that can handle anything you don't want to let go of that guy because you realize that that guy was made you weren't born him and that is when when you get comfortable gagin starts to die he starts to die that that that one Creature from the Black Lagoon that can live in a sewer that can eat rats all day that doesn't need water that doesn't need sunlight that do need nothing he can just live CU he knows he can that's a powerful human being that you never want to in it's in everybody that's the scary thing about that's what makes me so upset man is that everybody wants to put this Dagon label on me they forget the first three chapters of my book they forget how this started a lot of times it takes someone's wife dying or something like that for them to change yeah near death yeah something no no no none of that I wanted to figure out is there more to this horrible feeling of feeling like a loser can I change this and once you figure out I have the ability not through your mom or your dad or through a special school through you you have the ability to change this that's what makes me so mad once people put this title on me you now give yourself a get out of jail free card and say oh he's just crazy he's special he's unique he's this and that you just saved yourself from not having to do the work not having to do the work yeah and that's why I want people to hear my story I'm trying to take away all that bull craap that you want to put on me I'm trying to make you suffer up here to know what my Gody man he really had a hard way to go wow there was nothing special about him he wasn't talented he wasn't gifted he was nothing he wasn't nothing and he made it I want everybody to feel uncomfortable around me that's it cuz I want you to go home and think about yourself yeah think about yourself man because you're leaving so much on the table for the possibilities of which you can be you say most people are at 40% potential what percent are you at I like to say that I live in the 90% tole sometimes 99 100% is dead wow % is dead 99 sometimes 99 sometimes the reason why I know 99 because the first five hours of my day I am very uncomfortable what do you do first of all every morning I get up and people think I love to run I don't you know that's why do that's why I do it and and people don't understand that mentality oh you have to love it man no running has changed my life because every morning I know I'm going to do it if you know every every morning you do something you don't like every morning I going do it for and guess what if ice ran for an hour a day a day is 24 hours right what percent is that what's 1 hour of 20 was that 4% a small percent but anyway that's why I know I'm at a a high level because I'm at a dis not wanting to be dis you know uncomfortable I put myself in the dungeon every day off jump out of bed it starts shoes on out of bed while most people lose the battle in the morning like once you leave your beautiful house the war starts nowadays it starts before you leave home the phone rings social media is up the world's attacking you if you don't control what you can to build that armor so in the morning time what I'm doing is I'm building my armor it gets broken every night I get up in the morning time I start to build the armor let's run okay got to do our push-ups or sit ups our pull-ups you got go to the gym got do our stretch every morning I'm you do one hour in the morning of training oh no in the morning time I do at least an hour and a half and then I go to the gym of running hour and a half of running yes then I'm in the gym and then at night time every night for the last five to six years about five and a half years I've only missed two days of stretching for two to three hours two to three hours a night stretching I've only missed two days in five or about five and a half years wow stretching stretching why stretching that is where so the the sickness I had was my soas muscle got real tight huh and it caused my body long story short to pretty much choke me out from the inside so when you're young your soaz muscle your fighter flight muscle we're sitting down right now we're using the hit flexion muscle uhhuh when you're under stress as I was my whole life by being afraid of my father being tight your whole body is tight then I choose a job like being a Navy SEAL it's even Tighter and then I put myself under stress it's just tighten and tighten and tighten to it's a vice grip and you need healthy blood flow through your body I wasn't getting any of that so I pushed so hard in in life people say oh because you ran so much no sorry life emotional stress yes emotional stress made me just tight so now I couldn't sit down here for 10 seconds and I'd be like I was wound what that's done to me is allowed me to be even open even more open-minded I stretch out I get my body lengthened out it lengthens my mind out the possibilities out I calm myself down so during the morning time I build the armor I face the world because now I know there's going to be some disappointments along the way every day yes that's life but if you face disappointments already in Victory the things I can control is I can control my run mm I can control how my house looks how my how my world is I can control that so I've won open my door of Life Life Starts to beat me down but I'm facing it with the body armor that I created yes and now I'm facing life with with with the proper tools unlike I hit this snooze button I'm running late my house is a mess my mind's a mess now life's already beat you so you open the door and now life hit you and you're already frustrated you're already in that anxiety mode you're stressed already and then Life Starts to pow more on top you get home you're exhausted and that's how life happens to everyone you have to live and win what you can and build the body armor start callousing the mind so you're ready for combat outside of your house cuz it's going to come and that's what I realized at a young age I had no body armor I had no callous so when life came at me I I ran I tucked I lived in the fetal position trying to get away from life I wasn't protected I didn't protect myself I had nothing so I started realizing I got to form an armor to so I won't have to lie to you to make you like me so I'm not approaching people feeling insecure saying I have all these material things I don't have when you have that body armor you tell people hey man I'm not real smart but I try real hard mhm not the fact I I won't win this race man but been running for the last four years every day that's pretty good yeah that's the that's the mentality that you need to have yeah look at people knowing I know you and everybody else has issues so why am I why am I worried about how anybody thinks to me we're all on the same boat here some boats may be bigger than others but we all have problems so be it we're on the same boat yeah some of us are willing to not lie about it yeah I'm at that point now where I no longer care because why why can I go on here and tell people how up I am because I faced them they no longer Define who I am yeah it's not me it was me they don't control you anymore yeah when you're training in the morning or training at night or stretching at night what are you visualizing or thinking about nothing when I'm training in the morning time and it's a run for an hour and a half in the gymm and sometimes it's longer calisthenic type stuff an hour to an hour and a half is is the minimum yeah if I'm doing like a like a 100 mile race which you know like now I'm starting to build my miles back up come training for a race in January you know that that could be two two and a half three hours then once I come home from that it's right in the gym immediately so I'm exhausted I'm tired I'm dehydrated sodium low everything and that's where that's the edge because it's even more uncomfortable to do that that's right because all I want to do then stretch water relax that's it I had a long run I'm hot I'm dehydrated you already didn't want to run that's right so that's when because why in the race of Life life's not going to give you a glass of water when you're thirsty and I realized that and once again people my God your life is horrible it's not yeah this is how I live This is How I Live this is what I want I don't judge anybody this is how I live and there if there's not people like me in this world with this kind of mentality it's not be like David goggin go run 200 miles take something from this take something from this remember where I started from you don't need to go where I went right I went this far cuz I started opening different doors to the sell in my brain my God is this possible oh my God that's possible this possible I start open up different compartments you can leave them shut I don't care so what I do now in the morning time is I do this because why life's not going to give me the get out jail free card yeah and if I come on here on this podcast and talk this stuff I have to live what I say so when you come up from a world of used to lie a lot and my big thing is facing all this cra I cannot tell you something I have not done right cuz why when you start to formulate this character this code of ethic this ethos that you live not anybody else it's your own I cannot tell you something that I haven't done why because it will haunt me you are now drinking the coola a lot of people write books on self-help mental toughness all this crap half of them are living up to that standard mhm half of them are living up to that standard you have to be able to practice what you preach it has to be what you are that's why when people say my god when you speak on stuff it's so passionate because you're making me relive my life right it's not a comfortable life this life was made this life was earned yeah and if people like it great if not so be it at night time I think about nothing when you're stretching or when you're I'm stretching yeah that's my time that's my time to sit back and recharge for tomorrow because why this is not mental toughness is not a class we had this class that they designed eat the elfant one by that time selft talk visualization arousal control it's all great it's all great has to be a lifestyle yeah you work on mental callousing on a daily basis CU your even though your brain your mind like like your brain isn't the muscle so much you will lose it you will lose the ability to suffer in the worst of times if you come out of it for too long if you can lift 315 pounds and you stop going to the gym for a month I guarantee you won't be able to pick the same weight up again all the stories I talked about today all the things in that book if I went and said I'm good I gained all this knowledge if I sto today the knowledge is gone yeah I have to go back deep to retrieve it I don't want to go back deep to retrieve it I want to be able to call on it now that's why I do these things I know with not doing them will get me right right there's so much more I want to ask you but I want to try to wrap it up here with with three final questions um I didn't even get to any of the questions I had on here because I was just so inspired by everything but if you guys haven't uh picked this up yet you can pre-order it right now uh again can't hurt me master your mind and defy the odds make sure you guys get this book get a few copies for friends give them out as gifts this would be one of the most powerful things you give to someone um this is called actually I'm curious about I didn't I asked you about the greatest lesson from your mom but I'm I'm curious what's the greatest lesson your dad taught you whether he actually said it or you observed it um I observed it or or what not to do or yeah so I observed it from my dad um when I left I was young I had a young man's a young kid's point of view on my father so when I was 22 at 300 lb I went back to see my dad cuz I want to make sure that what I saw at 8 is the same vision because it's my father I don't want to not talk to my father no matter what he did no matter what I saw but was it through a young kid's eyes so at 22 I went back and I was able to examine him at a as a as a man as a fragile man that I was sure but I was able to examine him and through this process by this so by this point in my life I was examining myself and realizing I have a whole mess of problems Big Time some were from him some were for people that bullied me a lot were from me and in knowing how messed up I was I was able to examine everybody around me I examined him and I examined him to know my God the insec ities that you must have the problems that you must have inside of you I don't want to have those I come from my father I have what he has and I didn't want to be him why he made fun of me my brother why he beat the hell out of me my brother my mom it comes from a dark place an insecure dark dark place why he womanized why he sold prostitutes why he ran vire all this stuff he did a good human being doesn't need to do that a fulfilled human being doesn't need to break anyone down all they do is want to build you up so anybody you meet that calls you out of your name that bullies you that messes you up that that makes you feel not lifted they are dealing with something Dee rooted yeah you have to have a tough tone with some people to help them out there's a difference you have to be hard I'm hard on people but it comes from a good place yeah the biggest lesson he taught me was how not to be and that's why I had to fix what I was because insecurities make everybody around you feel like hell and that's the one thing I did not want anyone to feel like that's why I judge no one tons of whites have called me I've been tons of people have hurt me I judge no one because I know where it comes from I know you I was once you that's why now the place I'm at you get a get out of jail free card you need to help yourself you ain't bullying me man right you're fine you're I'm good whatever you throw at you I'm good I know what's wrong with you cuz I was once you right so I started to examine people examine myself examine my darkness realizing how I cannot be but I got it from examining him saying I cannot be that that's a powerful lesson so it's it's good lesson that he taught you yes through that observance how do you react or respond when someone says something to you negative or Cuts you off in a car or just something happens in life every day that could potentially upset you do you react do you respond do you do nothing do you give them a hug I mean what is the process for the process used to be angry David go scream at them swear at them yeah pick a fight that was the old me yeah the old me was pick a fight go go do whatever through this process of my life when you get to this point I'm man yeah and I still be in the car and I'll talk to my fiance this this it's jackass whatever whatever I now know that I can escalate a problem that's not really a problem I now now I have a a throttle and that's through self-examination is this a big is this a big deal is this something I need to approach with a level three engagement of like we're going at it right or just a level two engagement so now you have to be mature enough and I'm really big on maturity because I was never mature for so many years with age and knowledge you have to bring in maturity age doesn't mean you're mature it's going back in and say okay man look I'm at a point point my life what is smart if I do this I I can see the future I can see that if I do this this is going to happen I'm going to escalate this problem is this warranted there are some things that warrant me to escalate a problem yeah yeah and that's what I do now I take it through a process rate it yeah yes it goes on the rating program got it powerful um this is called the three truths I asked this question everyone at the end it's called three truths imagine uh it is your last day and you get to pick the day whenever you want you get to live as long as you want you pick the day but it's time for you to your body to go right you've created everything you want to create you've you've been at 99 percentile of potential for as long as you can live you've done it all you've checked off the list that everything that God says that you were supposed to do it's happened right written the books everything you want to do done but for whatever reason you've got to take all of your written word and videos and and and audio stuff that's out in the world you've got to take it with you MH but you get to write down on a piece of paper the three things you know to be true about all of your experiences and this is what you leave behind the three lessons or what I like to call the three truths what would you say are your three truths the first one is you are your own hero you are your own leader you are your own master and that is a big one because we idolize so many people mhm and we want to be them we want to be someone else and in doing that you lose all the potential of who you are you mimic you be them you are them you become them and you lose you and we look up to so many people in this world who will let us down we're humans I'm going to let you down you're going to let somebody down if you put them on a pet you then lose time when that person comes up and lets you down mhm you must hold yourself accountable and being your own hero that's what that does you make yourself so totally accountable for who you are you focus on you and only on you to become the best person you could be for others because we leave a lot on the table not searching who we are and then therefore you die not knowing your greatest potential right um that's one that's one the the the next one I would say is um the biggest one I would say is never pick the easy Road never never and it always goes back to kind of that the hero mentality never pick the easy Road ever in your life that is the one road that is Doom it is Doom if you want something like six minute abs all these different things people want it so fast you you may achieve what you wanted but you want the permanent fix the permanent fix comes from the Hard Road the Hard Road gives you permanent results the easy Road gives you the Quick Fix You will go back to where you started on the easy route that hard route is so permanent that it ends up callous s you everywhere everywhere you keep a six-pack forever you keep it you keep it because you know the work that goes into it yeah and the last one is when you get to where you want to go in life when you finally get there you finally reach that point and you're there and you're happy as hell realize this you're not there yet when you get that feeling that you be afraid right be truly afraid because now you start to do this slowly die slowly die either you're getting better or you're getting worse you're not staying the same yeah so when you get to where you think the journey is ended and you're sitting back and you're like I arrived I'm on Mount Everest I

your pure real heart because just meeting you for the first time walking in together just like I could tell how real you are and you're just a no BS type of guy the the adversity that you've overcome is crazy obviously people have overcome more than you me and lots of people in the world but what you had to overcome physically and psychologically and emotionally is unbelievable and to see that you weren't a statistic and instead you chose every single day to make a decision to be more than that is really inspiring and and I know this is going to impact and inspire a lot of people so I acknowledge you for your heart and for inspiring me you know I thought I worked out hard but this is like I feel like I'm doing nothing with my life so you're going to inspire me to continue to make bigger commitments and long commitments moving forward now so so I appreciate everything you do man and I'm excited about getting us out there um you're welcome my final question is what's your definition of greatness um you know what my definition of greatness is this it's not a definition it's an example this is greatness true greatness let's say that I'm the greatest tennis player of all time okay let's say that I hate tennis let say I'm the greatest tennis player of all time and I did 22 years I run all the grand slams I have all the I beat Roger feder I'm I am the best ever and we're having an interview and you're talking about my greatness what I achiev now I'm retired don't play tennis anymore haven't touched a racket in years and you're making me go back through my life you're kissing my butt about how great I am sure and I'm answering your questions every question I'm answering it I'm with you but in the back of my mind all I'm thinking about is all the times I could have won those matches that I lost by not bringing my best mindset you're haunted by all the opportunities that you missed by not bringing your best at that time when you could have won but you didn't win because you allowed life to interfere with that one shot when you're sitting there getting ready to serve for the match and your mind is not thinking about where that ball placement needs to be but thinking about your family this or this at work or that at work that's greatness greatness is your recall on every single shot that you missed throughout a 20-some year career every shot you can go back and say I was here this person was in the red shirt there greatness is being so aware of the time of life in the second that went by and you can recall like it was yesterday greatness is being able to go back there not making that same mistake again and being haunted by it that is greatness David ggins thanks man appreciate you man thank you powerful so I teach three rules of leadership number one 70% of leadership is how you lead yourself and these were the rules that I kind of created for myself and what I wasn't n doing in the past um what were you doing before uh I was living to do as I say and not as I do okay this is
