## Full Transcript

[00:03] I'm not good enough, smart enough.
[00:07] I'm not talented enough. Some people can
[00:10] start at one. Some people don't have to
[00:11] start at all. If you lack talent, you
[00:14] can't sit back and say, "I'll start in
[00:16] half an hour. I can't do that. I got to
[00:19] start now. And after I get back from
[00:21] starting, I got to start again. And then
[00:23] when I get done with that run or that
[00:25] study session, if it wasn't good enough,
[00:26] I got to go back again." Cuz repetition
[00:29] is what is is is what taught me
[00:31] everything. I know I'm going to do it.
[00:33] That's the haunting part is that it's
[00:36] going to happen. It has to happen. And
[00:40] that's a fact. There's no get out of
[00:42] jail free card, bro. None. Everything I
[00:45] do in life, it sucks.
[00:48] Everything I do in life, it sucks.
[00:50] That's why when I was 300 lb and 24
[00:53] years old, it wasn't like I had some big
[00:55] epiphany
[00:56] of let's just go be a Navy Seal and
[00:59] let's lose some weight. No, I knew my
[01:02] entire life was going to be a struggle,
[01:05] which is why I just ignored it. And I
[01:07] said, I'm not even trying to jump off
[01:11] into this [ __ ] and learn how to read,
[01:13] how to write, how to memorize, how to
[01:16] become something I am not. But through
[01:19] that process, something happened to me
[01:21] and I realized that's this is why I feel
[01:24] sorry for no one. And this podcast,
[01:26] they're going to really not like me
[01:29] because people are going to think that I
[01:32] am maybe lying or maybe fibbing or
[01:37] exaggerating. No, I am literally I was
[01:40] the lowest form on earth. no talent, no
[01:44] ability to learn, and I literally know
[01:47] what it is to be rock bottom and to
[01:49] build that up.
[01:51] >> So, TWO GUYS ASKED ME TO HELP HIM TRAIN
[01:54] FOR A MARATHON.
[01:56] OH, but they picked A SHITTY DAY TO
[01:58] TRAIN. It's 40°.
[02:02] Raining, windy, nasty.
[02:06] Those cats ARE INSIDE THE TREADMILL.
[02:09] YOU can't let conditions dictate your
[02:12] outcome.
[02:14] They believe that if it rains or snows
[02:18] worth too many,
[02:20] they may cancel the [ __ ] marathon.
[02:23] They ain't canceling [ __ ] You better
[02:26] train with whatever conditions they
[02:29] [ __ ] give you.
[02:32] The person that usually [ __ ] fills
[02:33] me, she's taking a DAY OFF IN THE CAR
[02:36] RIGHT NOW. This is too nasty.
[02:40] Don't do the same. Stay hard.
[02:45] I could never put into words on what I
[02:47] built and the power that is within all
[02:51] of us. Most people like for me, he's
[02:53] just crazy. I know I'm not crazy. I know
[02:56] what I had to do to get where I had to
[02:58] go. If you can't imagine yourself doing
[03:01] something, the person that's doing it is
[03:03] crazy because in your mind, the logic
[03:07] behind it, it doesn't compute.
[03:09] Therefore, you have to give somebody a
[03:11] title. And the title for me is usually
[03:14] he's crazy, he's this, he's that. No.
[03:16] No. Well, that's what I realized for
[03:18] myself was I wanted that comfort zone
[03:22] that everybody looks for that pat on the
[03:24] back. They don't want to hear all the
[03:26] bad [ __ ] They want to hear everything
[03:27] that they're doing right. And I realized
[03:29] that's what kept me in this world.
[03:32] That's what kept me in this world of not
[03:34] accomplishing anything. So what I did
[03:37] was I became the roughest critic in the
[03:41] world on myself. I literally saw myself
[03:44] in the mirror. I saw the truth. No one's
[03:47] going to come back to save me. No one's
[03:49] going to come back on this [ __ ] couch
[03:51] and say, "Hey, it's okay. You're going
[03:54] to be okay." No, I'm not. I'm not going
[03:56] to be okay. I I had to realize I I had
[03:58] to make a real stand. And it was painful
[04:01] to look at who I like who I was, what
[04:04] the world and myself created. Whether
[04:07] you like it or not, from the time you
[04:09] wake up to the time you go to bed, a lot
[04:11] of us are at war with ourselves. And
[04:14] within that war, you have several
[04:16] battles. Those battles are basically
[04:18] choices. No, I'm not talking about a war
[04:21] that you might find in the coliseum. I'm
[04:24] talking about a war that's in your
[04:25] brain. That war exists because life has
[04:29] so many choices. Within those choices,
[04:32] you got to make right decisions. But you
[04:34] know what? [ __ ] that. When alarm goes
[04:37] off in the morning, don't wake up. Don't
[04:40] wake up. Don't worry about that. When
[04:42] you're in school, you know what? [ __ ]
[04:44] that, man. It's too hard to study.
[04:48] You know what? Don't eat healthy cuz you
[04:49] don't have to. So, guess what? When you
[04:52] fail, don't blame your mom. Don't blame
[04:55] your dad. Don't blame teachers. Only
[04:58] person you have to blame is yourself. To
[05:00] get to extract or had to extract,
[05:03] something had to give. The same age you
[05:06] were giving speeches, I was trying to
[05:07] figure out how to say 'the' without
[05:08] stuttering. But for me to stop
[05:10] stuttering, I got to build [ __ ]
[05:12] confidence. Speech therapy didn't help
[05:14] that. Nothing helped that. I have to
[05:17] forgo a lot of [ __ ] to be as [ __ ] up
[05:20] as I am to build confidence. For me to
[05:24] stand in a [ __ ] room of 10,000 of one
[05:26] person and not and be like, "Oh, let put
[05:29] my head down. Let me look around."
[05:30] That's a miserable life. There was a lot
[05:33] of things I had to overcome to gain
[05:35] confidence.
[05:37] And in doing so, a lot of that had to
[05:40] go. A lot of it. You only sleep 4 hours
[05:43] a day, 2 hours a day. Sometimes you
[05:44] don't sleep at all. I know it's all
[05:47] important. I can't Something's got to go
[05:50] for me to get confidence cuz confidence
[05:52] is the building block of where I'm
[05:54] trying to go. For me to gain confidence
[05:56] in myself, this [ __ ] up kid has got to
[05:58] do a lot of [ __ ] up [ __ ] to gain
[06:00] confidence. There is no balance.
[06:03] There's no balance. So, yeah, I I don't
[06:06] sleep sometimes and sometimes I don't
[06:08] eat the right way and sometimes I don't
[06:09] do this and do that and whatever, man.
[06:12] You put me in a room of 10,000 people
[06:13] any time of the day and I walk in there
[06:16] thinking I'm the best [ __ ] in
[06:17] here cuz I know what it took to be on
[06:19] this stage and a lot of people would not
[06:21] do that. Theory, we cannot listen to
[06:24] theorists. So what theorists do is they
[06:28] take a 100 people and they study the
[06:31] normal people of the world. They're all
[06:35] studies. There's a whole bunch of people
[06:37] outside the normal they haven't done
[06:40] studies on. They haven't done studies on
[06:42] the people who are seriously great who
[06:45] are seriously great. They take studies
[06:47] off of normal people. You cannot live in
[06:51] that normal mindset. You must be your
[06:52] best on your worst days. And how you do
[06:56] that is you cannot think of a normal
[07:00] mindset. You cannot have a normal
[07:02] mindset. People are scared of that
[07:04] conversation with their wife, husband,
[07:07] girlfriend, boyfriend. And but why are
[07:09] you scared of it?
[07:11] Why are you scared to tell a
[07:12] [ __ ] your wife, your husband,
[07:15] who you are, exactly who you are? That
[07:17] that's a problem that a lot of us have
[07:19] in life. No one knows who you really
[07:21] are.
[07:23] No one knew who I really was. whatever I
[07:27] wanted to do. No one really knew the
[07:28] real me growing up because I never want
[07:31] anybody to know the real me. I was
[07:33] always afraid of what you might say or
[07:35] how you gonna feel or whatever. You got
[07:37] feelings. You have a life that you have
[07:40] to live. So, it's important that
[07:42] whatever's on your mind, you let that
[07:44] person know. Therefore, you're giving
[07:46] them the option to be with you or not.
[07:49] This is who I am. If you don't like it,
[07:51] that's good, man. I I got it. But this
[07:53] is David Gogggins. So there's that that
[07:56] honest conversation is very important,
[07:57] man. So everybody knows where they
[07:59] stand. That person may not be for you.
[08:02] That's all good.
[08:04] So I had a Q&A this weekend.
[08:07] This one guy there was super frustrated.
[08:11] I gained 20 lbs. I can't find my why. I
[08:15] can't find my purpose. I can't find
[08:17] motivation. Can't find a gym. He went on
[08:20] and on. So I said, "Hey, okay, relax.
[08:25] Just relax. Can you find your balls?
[08:29] Once you locate those, I need you to
[08:32] grab them. After you grab them, I need
[08:34] you to go find some shoes. If you got
[08:36] some shoes, you can go walk. You can go
[08:39] run. As far as a gym you can't find, do
[08:42] you have a floor where you live? Do some
[08:44] [ __ ] push-ups. Do some sit-ups. We're
[08:47] waiting to find purpose. We're waiting
[08:48] to find why. We're waiting to find all
[08:50] this [ __ ] before we start. The thing
[08:52] about it is this. Start now. So when you
[08:55] find your [ __ ] purpose, you find your
[08:57] why, you can get after it. Stay hard.
[09:00] This is the easy [ __ ] part. Them
[09:03] listening to this [ __ ] is the easy
[09:05] [ __ ] part. The part that why there'll
[09:09] always be the ones of ones is because
[09:12] putting that practice, putting that into
[09:15] actual work. No man. No, no. That's
[09:20] where the demons come in. That's where
[09:22] you like I like I I don't want to be
[09:25] better. I don't want to be better. This
[09:27] is what it takes to be better. I don't
[09:28] want to be better. So everybody's That's
[09:30] why there's a lot of average. And it
[09:33] makes me so [ __ ] mad. Every day I
[09:37] walk this earth and I see average all
[09:39] over the [ __ ] place and they want to
[09:41] ask me, "How did you do it?" I can't
[09:44] tell you how cuz you're not going to
[09:45] [ __ ] You're not going to do it.
[09:47] you're not going to do it. You're just
[09:49] you're going to continue being because
[09:50] every day you wake up like he said, it's
[09:52] not like get the coffee,
[09:55] make the make the pancakes,
[09:58] kiss the girl, kiss the kids. You wake
[10:00] up right to work immediately. Your mind
[10:04] is in action. No one wants to do that.
[10:07] No one. And I don't blame them. But
[10:10] don't be mad when you're laying there in
[10:12] your [ __ ] bed and you're in the
[10:14] [ __ ] hospital and you're 70, 80, 90
[10:16] years old and you're thinking,
[10:18] "Man, I feel like I didn't [ __ ] do
[10:20] something cuz you did. You didn't do it.
[10:24] You didn't do [ __ ] You may have lived a
[10:27] great life, man, but you're always going
[10:28] to feel empty inside." I don't feel
[10:29] empty. So, call me what you want.
[10:32] There's not one empty bone in my [ __ ]
[10:35] body because I have figured out that
[10:39] really the magic potion at least to my
[10:42] life and it's very rewarding.
