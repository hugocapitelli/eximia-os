[00:00] I'm back
[00:02] [ __ ] I'm
[00:05] back what do you think most people get
[00:07] wrong about motivation they think that
[00:09] maybe once I get it I'm going to hold on
[00:11] to it it's nothing is permanent nothing
[00:15] is permanent and a lot of times you have
[00:17] to learn to perform without
[00:19] motivation and that's what people think
[00:22] they think I need to have this
[00:24] motivation to work out to study to be
[00:27] better so if they don't have it they
[00:30] just don't [ __ ] do it and that's
[00:32] where you
[00:33] fail you have to learn to train your
[00:36] mind well beyond motivation if you have
[00:39] motivation that's great that's some
[00:41] kindling to the fire all it takes is a
[00:43] little bit of [ __ ] spark you can burn
[00:45] a whole Forest up but motivation you
[00:48] have to learn to exist without it you
[00:50] have to learn to be you have to be your
[00:52] best self and your least motivated but
[00:55] where do you go to you wake up on the
[00:56] morning it's cold it's wet it's dark
[00:59] you've got no cotage in your knee keep
[01:01] talking you're just a [ __ ] correct
[01:04] you're honestly that's not me trying to
[01:06] be some after school special [ __ ] you
[01:08] really are a [ __ ] I know there's a
[01:11] whole bunch of people with that right
[01:13] there that fires me up that makes me
[01:16] [ __ ] happy what you just said that
[01:19] brings joy to my life right there why
[01:21] cuz I know there's so many people that
[01:23] have the
[01:24] ability and just refuse to get off that
[01:28] couch refuse refuse to study a few more
[01:31] hours refuse to go deeper to go further
[01:34] and that's where I gain the advantage
[01:37] it's so easy to be great nowadays my
[01:39] friend cuz most people are weak most
[01:41] people don't want to go to that extra
[01:43] mile most people don't want to find that
[01:44] extra cuz it sucks it's miserable it's
[01:48] lonely and so many people just want it
[01:51] the easy way it I'm sorry man it's not
[01:54] so what they start to do is they build
[01:56] this
[01:57] Narrative of it's okay when the
[02:00] narrative should be you need to [ __ ]
[02:02] work harder you need to [ __ ]
[02:04] discipline your mind better we need to
[02:07] help people more than just saying it's
[02:10] okay it's okay that you're not [ __ ]
[02:13] willing to [ __ ] help yourself out
[02:15] that's not okay it's not okay it's not
[02:17] acceptable even though it's your life if
[02:20] that's if if that's acceptable that's
[02:22] unacceptable and there's a lot of people
[02:24] in this world me included that if I
[02:26] accepted that I wouldn't be anywhere
[02:29] [ __ ] the purpose is you we
[02:32] forget that every [ __ ] day I wake up
[02:34] and I don't want to do some [ __ ] [ __ ]
[02:36] I'm like okay man do you want to be a
[02:37] [ __ ] today do you want to feel like a
[02:39] little [ __ ] do you want to walk around
[02:40] all day knowing that you could but you
[02:42] didn't so I I it's performed without
[02:46] purpose you have to learn how to get up

[04:53] how did you do
[04:54] it come on we want to see it good 22
[04:58] who's going to carry the ball
[05:00] in the law I can't tell you how cuz
[05:02] you're not going to [ __ ] you're not
[05:03] going to do it but don't be mad when
[05:06] you're laying there and your [ __ ] bed
[05:08] you're in the [ __ ] hospital and
[05:09] you're 70 80 90 years old you're
[05:13] thinking man I feel like I didn't
[05:14] [ __ ] do something cuz you did you
[05:18] didn't do it you didn't do [ __ ] this has
[05:21] to be in you something in you has to
[05:25] wake up and usually the only person that
[05:28] can wake it up is you how bad do you
[05:30] want this if it's as bad as you want to
[05:33] live or breathe or sleep whatever the
[05:35] hell it may be I can work with you but a
[05:38] lot of people most people don't want it
[05:41] that badly which why they always ask the
[05:43] question man how do you get to where you
[05:44] are you know how to do it you know
[05:47] exactly how to be you or how to be me
[05:50] you don't want to do it so I can't make
[05:53] you do it nor do I have the time or
[05:55] energy to force you into that place that
[05:58] I know you have to be to do it there's
[06:01] no luck in this game man it may be a
[06:03] little bit of luck but the luck happens
[06:04] after you bust your ass and you put
[06:07] yourself in that lucky situation luck
[06:10] doesn't happen you put yourself in that
[06:12] situation where luck might [ __ ]
[06:14] happen and that's what people don't know
[06:17] but to get there luck ain't going to
[06:20] happen you have to put yourself in that
[06:22] situation man people talk about
[06:24] discipline and [ __ ] determination and
[06:27] [ __ ] you know repetitions and all
[06:29] this [ __ ]
[06:31] consistency why people fall off the
[06:33] wagon so often is because their mind is
[06:36] full of [ __ ] there's no room in that
[06:39] mind for discipline there's no room for
[06:41] consistency they may do it once or twice
[06:44] but then the mind takes over and that
[06:46] cluttered [ __ ] garage comes in and
[06:49] then it's like a circuit breaker man a
[06:51] circuit breaker just overloads and it
[06:52] [ __ ] Sparks I rather you hate me and
[06:56] get better than like me and stay the
[06:59] same
