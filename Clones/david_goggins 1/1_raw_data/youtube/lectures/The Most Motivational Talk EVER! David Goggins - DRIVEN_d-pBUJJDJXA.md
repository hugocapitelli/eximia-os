## Transcrição

it  took  a  while  to  get  to  that  point 
 where  enough  was  enough 
 what  happened  I  came  home  one  night  from 
 work  spraying  for  cockroaches  and  long 
 story  short  I  turned  on  the  Discovery 
 Channel  I  saw  some  guys  going  through 
 Navy  SEAL  training  and  they're  going 
 through  hell  week  and  they  were  getting 
 their  ass  just  beat  you  know  in  out  of 
 the  water 
 guys  ringing  the  bell  there  was 
 suffering  and  I  was  waiting  like  297 
 pounds  and  I  had  to  make  a  change  in  my 
 life  I  wasn't  going  anywhere  and  I  was 
 exactly  what  everybody  said  I  was  going 
 to  be  which  was  nothing  I  came  from  a 
 horrible  background  I  got  called  [ __ ] 
 every  day  of  my  life  growing  up  lived  in 
 a  small  town  the  Klan  headquarters  at 
 that  time  was  about  20  minutes  from 
 where  I  lived  the  one  of  the  high  ups  in 
 the  KKK  son  sat  behind  me  two  classes  so 
 he  called  me  a  [ __ ]  a  long  time  I  got 
 my  first  car  they  spray  print  [ __ ] 
 we're  gonna  kill  you  on  it  so  I  was  just 
 an  insecure  scared  kid 
 and  the  only  way  I  could  find  myself  was 
 to  put  myself  through  the  worst  thing 
 possible  one  time  this  this  person  drew 
 a  picture  of  me  and  you  know  I  said 
 we're  going  to  kill  you  [ __ ]  on  my 
 Spanish  notebook  and  I  took  it  to  my 
 principal  and  my  principal  said  they 
 spell  [ __ ]  Niger  that  was  the  best 
 advice  you  can  give  me  so  long  story 
 short  what  I  realized  was  no  one  was 
 here  to  help  me  and  the  feeling  I  had 
 every  morning  I  started  shaving  my  hair 
 not  sixteen  years  old 
 in  the  feeling  I  had  every  morning  I 
 looked  in  the  mirror  was  horrible  and  I 
 don't  wanna  feel  like  anymore  and  how  I 
 felt  was  a  kid  going  nowhere  a  kid  that 
 was  scared  and  most  kids  will  accept 
 that  and  look  for  help  but  the  best 
 thing  that  happened  to  me  no  one  helped 
 me  no  one  felt  sorry  for  me  I  had  to 
 figure  out  I  wasn't  going  to  be  a  punk 
 kid  all  my  life  so  in  a  way  I  could  turn 
 around  was  to  suffer  I  had  to  build 
 calluses  in  my  brain  the  same  way  I 
 built  calluses  on  my  hands  so  I  brought 
 the  gift  of  the  world's  records  for 
 pulse  a  long  time  ago  but  I  felt  in  it 
 twice  and  I  did  67,000  pull-ups  in 
 trying  to  break  this  record  so  to  do 
 four  thousand  thirty  pull-ups  I  had  to 
 do  67  thousand  for  training  for  them  Wow 
 and  so  what  I  realized  is  for  me  to 
 become  the  man  I  wanted  to  become  I  saw 
 myself  as  the  weakest  person  God  ever 
 created  but  I  never  blamed  God  for 
 anything  he  did  to  me  so  I  wanted  to 
 change  that  to  be  the  hardest  man  ever 
 created  am  i  that  I  don't  know  but  you 
 had  to  have  a  goal  and  my  goal  when  I 
 was  sitting  there  not  going  to  school 
 being  bullied  being  having  no 
 self-esteem 
 my  goal  was  the  only  person  that's  gonna 
 turn  this  person  around  is  me  you  know 
 what  I  can  turned  around  is  put  myself 
 through  the  worst  things  possible  a 
 human  being  can  ever  endure  and  I'd  be 
 the  only  way  that  I  can  build  this  brain 
 to  handle  anything  that  comes  in  front 
 of  him  callus  in  my  mind 
 through  pain  and  suffering  but  what  I 
 find  so  interesting  is  how  we  as  a 
 species  run  from  pain  we  run  from 
 suffering  I  firmly  believe  that  you  need 
 something  that  is  brutal  is  difficult  is 
 hardship  it  knocks  you  off  Center  it 
 makes  you  feel  bad  because  in  the 
 process  of  rebuilding  and  clawing  back 
 from  that  climbing  up  then  you  can 
 become  something  but  you  unless  you've 
 been  tested  unless  you've  gone  through 
 the  wringer  you've  got  no  hope  so  how  do 
 you  take  somebody  that  you  love  and 
 force  them  through  that  because  I'm 
 gonna  say  the  exact  opposite  of  what  the 
 world  today's  world  is  saying  so  we  read 
 a  bunch  of  books  nowadays  as  humans  we 
 we  want  to  find  out  how  to  be  someone 
 else  what  we  don't  do  is  we  don't  go 
 inside  so  literally  turn  yourself  inside 
 out  read  the  book  that  since  I  feel  like 
 we're  writing  a  book  every  day  of  our 
 lives 
 but  we  never  read  that  book  you  have  to 
 look  inside  of  yourself  to  see  what  you 
 really  want  what  are  you  passionate 
 about  we  use  these  words  and  these 
 little  phrases  of  only  the  strong 
 survive  and  also  the  crab  there's  all 
 just  [ __ ]  words  I  get  so  tired  of 
 hearing  people  just  talking  like  right 
 now  someone  may  think  Gaga  is  talking 
 but  you  don't  know  me  so  when  I  speak  I 
 speak  from  Pasha  I  speak  from  experience 
 I  speak  from  suffering  the  only  way  I 
 believe  this  is  just  my  experience  in 
 life  the  only  way  you're  ever  going  to 
 get  to  the  other  side  of  this  journey 
 is  you  have  gotten  to  supper  to  grow  to 
 grow  you  must  suffer  and  some  people  get 
 into  the  moment  but  they  have  to  see 
 what  their  journey  is  to  start  their 
 journey  several  people  live  to  be  a 
 hundred  years  old 
 they  have  great  lives  and  have  great 
 kids  the  kids  go  to  college  officers 
 dumping  but  somewhere  in  their  life 
 there  was  a  point  where  they  had  their 
 decision  to  make 
 they  can  go  left  or  right  on  this  path 
 left  was  the  easy  route  right  was  a  hard 
 round  a  lot  of  people  take  the  easy 
 route  and  they  had  a  good  life  that  way 
 but  the  better  life  was  going  to  the 
 right  side  and  you  may  have  20  years  of 
 pain  and  suffering  to  get  past  it  but  a 
 lot  of  us  died  never  truly  starting  our 
 journey  got  to  start  to  journey  it  may 
 suck  but  it  will  it  will  come  out  to  her 
 side  when  you're  coach  every  day  we're 
 seeing  who  we  are  as  people  when  I  was 
 growing  up  I  I  lied  for  people  to  accept 
 me  because  I  did  accept  myself  so  I 
 would  make  up  stories  so  that  you  would 
 accept  me  into  your  world  I  would  uh 
 everything  I  did  was  for  someone  else  to 
 like  me  it  was  until  I  started  reading 
 the  whole  book  about  how  pathetic  I  was 
 as  human  being  I  could  play  my  dad  I  can 
 blame  kids  at  school  I  could  blame 
 having  health  issues  ATD  my  mom  not 
 being  around  I  could  blame  a  lot  of 
 people  and  that's  the  book  I  was  reading 
 and  I  put  it  off  on  everybody  else  it 
 was  until  I  say  you  know  what  for  me  to 
 fix  this  I  get  a  read  what  the  hell  what 
 the  [ __ ]  is  wrong  with  David  ah  it's  not 
 not  blaming  anybody  read  my  book  is  okay 
 I'm  afraid  of  my  shadow  how  can  I 
 overcome  that  go  in  and  militare  and  get 
 your  ass  kicked 
 do  things  you  hate  to  do  be 
 uncomfortable  every  [ __ ]  day  of  your 
 life  Roger  that 
 I'm  not  the  smartest  kid  in  the  world 
 okay  it  says  somebody  say  oh  you're 
 smart  I  will  say  it  to  yourself  I  said 
 to  myself  no  I'm  a  dumb  [ __ ] 
 okay  Roger  that  how  you  get  smarter 
 educate  yourself  so  the  things  that  we 
 work  from  we  run  it  from  the  truth  we 
 run  it  from  the  truth  man  so  the  only 
 way  I  became  successful  was  going 
 towards  the  truth  as  painful  and  as 
 brutal  as  it  is  it  changed  me  it  allowed 
 me  to  become  in  my  own  right  Who  am 
 today  I  knew  nothing  about 
 ultramarathons 
 I  hadn't  run  America  I  knew  nothing 
 about  this  world 
 so  our  guru  that  little  the  top  10 
 hardest  races  in  world  and  what  comes  up 
 as  a  bad  water  135  so  her  35  mile  race 
 through  Death  Valley  the  summer  time  I 
 thought  was  a  race  when  you  run  like  20 
 miles  set  up  camp  you  know 
 barbecue  outside  and  then  go  run  some 
 more  the  next  day  so  I  called  the  ranks 
 director  up  at  the  race  and  said  hey 
 Chris  and  there  was  Chris  Koster 
 I  want  to  do  your  race 
 [Music] 
 I  am  put  running  shoes  on  over  a  year  I 
 was  a  big-time  power  lifter  I  lifted 
 weights  heavy  that's  what  I  did 
 I  just  got  back  home  from  Iraq  we 
 stripped  the  freefall  school  and  then 
 this  happened  so  I  called  Chris  costumed 
 up  on  a  Wednesday  he  says  look  man  the 
 only  way  you  can  qualify  for  my  races  to 
 run  a  hundred  miles  at  one  time  in  24 
 hours  or  less  and  he  said  if  you  qualify 
 by  running  hundred  miles  or  less  in  24 
 hours  I  would  consider  you  my  race  I'll 
 cut  to  the  chase  I  signed  up  for  this 
 race  it's  called  a  San  Diego  one  day 
 were  you  running  to  run  a  one-mile  track 
 for  24  hours  to  city  miles  you  can  get 
 my  goal  was  a  hundred  pounds  so  I  got  2 
 miles  70  and  I  cleared  70  pounds  my  1213 
 hours  pretty  quickly  but  I  was  done  my 
 feet  were  broken 
 I  was  stretched  fractured  shin  splints 
 muscles  were  tearing  I  was  in  bad  shape 
 I  was  eating  rich  crackers  and  drinks 
 and  that's  all  I  had  no  water  didn't 
 know  what  the  hell  I  was  doing  out  there 
 so  I  sat  down  at  Mile  70  at  this  time  I 
 was  married  and  I  look  at  my  wife  and  I 
 was  like  oh  I  messed  up  bad  so  I 
 literally  starts  to  turn  white  Here  I  am 
 I'm  all  [ __ ]  up  in  this  chair  I'm  at 
 Mile  seven  if  they  got  30  [ __ ]  miles 
 to  go  I'm  jacked  up  I  got  to  go  to  the 
 bathroom  the  bathrooms  like  20  feet  from 
 me  supporter  party  I  can't  get  out  of 
 the  [ __ ]  chair  so  I'm  peeing  blood 
 down  my  leg  whoa  Cooper  not  my  [ __ ] 
 pack 
 and  I  got  30  miles  to  go  and  I'm  I  can't 
 stand  up  can  my  my  blood  pressures  all 
 messed  up 
 I've  been  in  three  whole  weeks  Ranger 
 school  overcome  so  many  obstacles  in  my 
 life  this  last  30  miles  of  this  race  is 
 when  I  realized  a  human  being  is  not  so 
 human  anymore 
 [Music] 
 we  have  the  ability  to  go  in  such  a 
 space  if  you're  willing  to  suffer  and  I 
 mean  suffer  your  brain  and  your  body 
 once  connected  together  you  can  do 
 anything  and  this  30  miles  was  the 
 life-changing  moment  I  was  out  of  it  I 
 was  in  the  worst  pain  in  my  entire  life 
 I  was  to  me  on  the  brink  of  death  and  I 
 was  able  to  chunk  this  30  damn  miles 
 into  small  pieces  I  was  so  driven  and 
 I'm  not  gonna  say  motivated  cuz 
 motivations  crap  motivation  comes  and 
 goes  when  you're  driven  whatever's  in 
 front  of  you  will  get  destroyed  so  I  sat 
 in  this  chair  and  I  was  so  driven  to 
 succeed  in  this  race  in  it  and  at  this 
 time 
 everyone's  rethinking  about  the  guys 
 that  died  and  I'm  not  gonna  lie  to  you  I 
 was  this  became  a  personal  thing  this 
 became  me  against  this  race  me  against 
 the  kids  that  called  me  [ __ ]  me  against 
 me  it  just  became  something  that  took  so 
 good  so  violently  personally  and  I  broke 
 this  thing  down  into  small  pieces  I  said 
 okay  I  got  to  get  nutrition  I  gotta  be 
 able  to  stand  up  before  I  can  get  off 
 his  current  and  off  his  chair  and  be 
 able  to  go  30  miles  so  I  went  through 
 all  these  small  steps  and  I  was  able  to 
 stand  up 
 then  I'm  standing  up  I  was  literally 
 walking  around  with  my  wife  at  the  time 
 and  she  goes  she's  not  gonna  make  the 
 time  she  goes  you're  working  on  me 
 you're  walking  like  30  72  hours  I  got 
 tomorrow  81  and  the  second  she  said  that 
 I'm  not  gonna  make  the  time  I  ran  the 
 last  19  miles  non-stop  I  had  to  put 
 compression  tape  on  my  own  and  I  had  so 
 this  was  years  ago  I  had  literally  the 
 size  of  half  dollars  I  had  to  get 
 compression  tape  and  I  kicked  up  my 
 ankles  and  i  taked  up  my  feet  and  that's 
 how  I  got  through  that  race  like  my 
 shins  hurt  so  bad  and  have  her  stress 
 fractures  that's  the  only  way  I  could 
 continue  on  was  I  taped  it  so  I  wasn't 
 doing  the  flexor  motion  that  that 
 activates  your  your  shins 
 so  I  taped  my  ankles  and  my  shins  up  and 
 I  got  that  from  because  of  my  third  hell 
 week  they  were  let  me  go  back  to  no 
 training  so  I  literally  went  through  all 
 the  buds  my  last  SEAL  training  my  stress 
 fractures  how  I  get  it  because  I  would 
 take  my  ankles  all  the  way  up  to  my  cab 
 every  morning  since  the  first  hour  the 
 pain  was  excruciating  but  what  happened 
 is 
 that  did  that  every  single  day 
 people  may  listen  to  this  and  say  this 
 guy  is  sadistic 
 he's  crazy  know  if  you  know  how  I  came 
 up  you  realize  I  was  just  a  scared  kid 
 that  found  drive  and  passion  to  be 
 something  much  better  than  what  he 
 thought  that's  all  it  is  my  biggest 
 advice  to  get  everybody  in  the  world  is 
 like  I  say  you  live  in  an  external  world 
 everything  is  is  you  got  to  see  it  touch 
 it  it's  external  if  you  can  for  the  rest 
 of  your  life 
 live  inside  of  yourself  stop  listening 
 to  people  who  are  calling  you  fat  gay 
 transsexual  [ __ ]  everything  that  is 
 makes  no  sense  all  these  insecure  people 
 putting  their  insecurities  on  you  you 
 gotta  flush  it  out  you  got  to  just  be 
 whoever  the  hell  God  or  whatever  the 
 hell  you  believe  in  if  you  believe  in 
 nothing  but  yourself  I  don't  care  what 
 it  is  you're  gonna  take  everything  and 
 throw  it  away  you  have  to  believe  in  one 
 thing  and  that  is  yourself  and  and  I'm 
 not  saying  don't  believe  in  God  what  you 
 believe  in  but  right  now  so  you  define 
 greatness  in  yourself  you're  not  gonna 
 find  it  by  looking  in  a  book  or  if  I 
 even  hearing  me  I  may  give  you  the  spark 
 but  you've  got  to  go  inside  yourself  to 
 find  it  and  that  means  you  gotta  be 
 quiet  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  go  on  a  room 
 stop  talking  search  your  soul  search 
 your  mind  search  your  abilities  and 
 you'll  find  it  but  if  you're  not  looking 
 for  it  you  won't  find  it  so  you  got  to 
 go  start  your  journey  and  the  journey 
 starts  with  you  finding  why  the  hell  in 
 like  you 
 why  am  I  here  if  you  don't  know  that  you 
 will  live  the  rest  your  life  searching 
 always  asking  a  question  cookie  jar  is 
 something  that  I've  made  up  of  all  the 
 failures  of  my  life  all  the  things  that 
 I  was  I  failed  and  I  went  back  I  failed 
 I  went  back  and  I  finally  succeeded  all 
 the  things  that  kicked  my  ass  I  put  them 
 all  in  the  cookie  jar  because  at  times 
 of  hell  even  the  hardest  men  in  times  of 
 suffering  what  we  do  was  we  forget  how 
 far  we  moving  on  because  that's  what 
 suffering  is  suffering  is  a  test  some  of 
 this  suffering  is  a  true  test  of  life 
 and  instead  of  that  cookie  jar  travels 
 in  my  brain  so  whenever  I  get  put  in  a 
 situation  where  I  have  poopy  pants  the 
 lowers  me  mentality  of  oh  my  god  life 
 sucks  I  take  a  second  I  take  the  one 
 second  decision  I  step  out  of  my  life 
 for  one  second  going  the  cookie  jar 
 pull-up  Oh  [ __ ]  you  went  you 
 were  in  three  whole  weeks  and  finished 
 to  one  of  those  topics  a  guy  died  in 
 because  it  was  so  bad  oh  he  want  her 
 [ __ ]  badass  I  put  it  back  in 
 the  cookie  jar  and  I  remember  who  the 
 [ __ ]  I  really  am  I'm  not  the  kid  that 
 guy  that  was  calling  me  I'm  not  the 
 scared  kid  this  is  who  I  am  it's  a 
 reminder  of  who  you  truly  are  at  the 
 core  of  yourself  but  what  I  was  saying 
 to  myself  the  whole  time  on  that  track 
 in  it  and  this  is  what  I  say  to  myself 
 self  talk  and  visualization  of  the  two 
 keys  to  my  success  I  believed  for  that 
 last  time  19  miles  I  was  indestructible 
 because  I  took  myself  in  that  chair 
 crapping  up  my  back  peeing  blood  in  my 
 leg  shin  splints  stress  fractures  I  used 
 all  that  for  motivation  versus 
 negativity  I  use  it  for  motivation  I 
 said  to  myself  who  on  this  [ __ ] 
 we'd  still  be  going  right  now  you  are 
 you  are  you  got  to  be  the  hardest 
 [ __ ]  on  the  planet  is  it  true  I 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  at  that  time  it  got  me 
 to  the  finish  line  of  that  [ __ ]  race 
 I  believed  it 
 I  believe  it  today  I  believed  it  enough 
 to  where  my  body  said  he's  not  gonna 
 stop  and  that's  I  took  all  the  negative 
 things  I  need  to  go  to  the  hospital  this 
 and  that  and  I  use  you  who  they  don't 
 even  think  about  taping  stress  fractures 
 all  those  things  I'd  use  for  motivation 
 so  if  you  think  that  I'm  some  unhappy 
 guy  you're  wrong 
 having  lived  a  life  I've  lived  in  seeing 
 the  other  side  not  being  afraid  to 
 attack  what  was  in  front  of  me  has  made 
 me  happy 
 say  that  again  in  fact  let  me  make  sure 
 I  understood  it  getting  to  the  point 
 where  you're  not  afraid  to  face  the 
 thing  on  the  other  side  of  the  door  that 
 wants  to  attack  you  has  made  you  happy 
 right  what  the  dark  side  is  is  we  all 
 have  a  cookie  jar  and  we  all  have  a  jar 
 of  [ __ ]  or  [ __ ]  just  it's  just  ain't 
 good  night  and  in  hell  week  what  they  do 
 in  hell  week  okay  this  is  where  I  really 
 went  to  the  dark  side  what  they're  doing 
 hell  because  they  design  how  weak  to 
 find  your  flaws  and  they  do  a  really 
 good  job  of  that  it's  130  hours  of 
 continuous  training  you  may  get  two 
 hours  of  sleep  and  they  beat  the  [ __ ] 
 out  of  you  and  find  everything  wrong 
 with  your  mentality  and  then  they  start 
 helping  and  that's  the  beauty  of  it  and 
 for  me  I'm  not  some  not  no  nasty  guy 
 giving  guy  you  know  I  don't  have  a  great 
 bit  of  talent  in  anything  so  what  got  me 
 through  horrible  times  was  the  dark  side 
 whereas  I  created  my  name  is  David 
 Goggin  I  created  Goggins  Goggins  is  the 
 guy  that  can  take  anything  you  put  in 
 front  of  them  you  want  to  break  my 
 [ __ ]  legs  so  be  it 
 I  have  a  way  of  going  to  a  place  I  could 
 did  in  that  race  where  all  the  pain  and 
 suffering  that  they  put  on  top  of  me  in 
 hell  week  I  will  reverse  that  pain  and 
 suffering  and  I  will  take  your  soul  so 
 every  instructor  that  put  me  through  but 
 it's  my  job  what  drove  me  was  I  wanted 
 you  to  go  home  that  night  after  you  beat 
 the  living  [ __ ]  out  of  me  and  I  smiled 
 in  your  face  I  wanted  you  to  feel  worse 
 than  I  did  and  you  were  going  home  to  a 
 nice  warm  bed  with  your  wife  or  your 
 kids  and  a  nice  meal  and  I  was  still  out 
 there  in  the  grip  suffering  for  another 
 hundred  Alex  I  want  you  to  think  about 
 me  knowing  that  I'm  comfortable  being 
 very  unfuckin  comfortable  and  I  want  you 
 to  think  about  when  you  would  do  [ __ ] 
 healthy  how  uncomfortable  you  were  how 
 bad  you  wanted  to  quit  you  knowing  I'm 
 not  thinking  that  [ __ ]  so  the  dark 
 side  is  something  that  I've  designed 
 it's  an  evil  place  I  can  go  that  very 
 few  things  can  hurt 
 I  used  to  hurt  you're  trying  to  put  on 
 me  I  flip  it  upside  down  and  use  it  you 
 try  use  it  for  kryptonite  and  now  it's 
 power  pillars  for  me  I'm  I'm  your  little 
 strength  I  flip  negative  into  positive 
 targets 
 people  I  said  man  you  cuss  all  the 
 [ __ ]  time  why  well  I  hate  to  say  it 
 the  best  way  for  me  to  get  how  I  feel 
 across  I  can't  see  any  say  you  know  what 
 I  went  through  hell  week  and  man  it  was 
 it  was  really  hard  know  that 
 [ __ ] 
 takes  your  damn  soul  rips  it  inside  out 
 and  then  they  say  now  we're  going  to 
 [ __ ]  start  it  it  allows  me  to  express 
 where  I  was  at  at  a  point  of  my  life  if 
 I  don't  give  you  all  of  me  why  the  hell 
 am  I  here 
 why  how  will  you  learn  for  me  people 
 take  so  much  offense  to  me  you  will 
 never  learn  from  people  if  we  always 
 tap-dance  around  the  truth  by  finding 
 the  right  words  I  don't  hurt  you  because 
 you  have  thin  skin  no  tighten  up  people 
 it's  okay 
 trust  me  it's  okay  you  might  be  called 
 [ __ ]  one  day  it's  okay  you  might  be 
 cause  some  Jewish  word  or  some  [ __ ]  or 
 gay  word  it's  okay  let  them  call  you 
 that  what  are  you  going  to  do  now  they 
 don't  own  your  life  how  are  you  going  to 
 control  that  how  are  you  going  to  flip 
 it  upside  down  and  say  Roger  that  now 
 I'm  going  to  harness  this  [ __ ]  and 
 you're  read  about  me  years  from  now  how 
 that's  the  question  are  you  going  to  do 
 thicken  your  skin  become  more  believe 
 it'll  be  afraid  of  the  reflection  in  the 
 mirror  that's  all  you  can  be  afraid  of 
 once  you  overcome  the  reflection  in  the 
 mirror  you've  done  it  the  younger 
 generation  quits  not  everybody  so  I  got 
 it  I  got  put  it  people  get  to  butthurt 
 so  not  everybody  most  of  this  generation 
 quits  the  second  they  get  talk  to  you 
 did  this  wrong  you  did  this  wrong  or 
 they  get  yelled  at  it  so  Lisa's  number 
 two  be  great  nowadays  because  everybody 
 else's  most  people  are  weak  this  this  is 
 a  softer  generation  so  if  you  have  any 
 mental  toughness  any  of  any  ability  give 
 any  fraction  of  self-discipline  the 
 ability  to  not  want  to  do  it  but  still 
 do  it 
 people  have  a  hard  thing  understand  I 
 hate  to  run  and  it  makes  me  so  crazy  it 
 doesn't  need  more  people  why  did  you  run 
 if  you  hate  it 
 what  are  you  talking  about  I  don't  want 
 to  take  showers  and  eat  either  I  hate 
 that  too  there's  the  whole  that's  a  life 
 man  that  innit 
 it  wasn't  until  I  changed  that  mentality 
 then  I  became  somebody  I  hate  it  going 
 to  school  so  I  guess  what  I  was  dumb  as 
 [ __ ]  that's  what  will  one  plus  one  is 
 two  but  if  you  can  get  through  to  doing 
 things  that  you  hate  to  do  on  the  other 
 side  is  greatness 
 that's  what  people  are  saying  by  me 
 running  iein  Calais  in  my  mind  I'm  not 
 training  for  a  race  I'm  training  for 
 life  I'm  training  for  the  time  when  I 
 get  that  two  o'clock  in  the  morning  call 
 that  my  mom  is  dead  or  something  happens 
 tragic  in  life  I  don't  fall  apart  I'm 
 training  my  mind  and  my  body  my  spirit 
 so  it's  all  one  so  I  can  handle  what 
 life  is  gonna  throw  at  me  because  to 
 life  I've  lived  it  throws  a  whole  bunch 
 at  you  and  if  you're  not  physically 
 immensely  prepared  for  that  you're  just 
 gonna  crumble  and  you're  good  for  nobody 
 when  you  are  on  one  side  of  the  door  and 
 your  mind  is  racing  because  on  the  other 
 side  of  that  door  it  could  be  no  one  it 
 could  be  four  guys  with  four  ak-47s  that 
 that  door  are  you  about  to  open  can  be 
 trapped  so  once  you  open  it  boom  your 
 legs  are  gone  so  there's  a  thousand 
 things  you  think  about  when  you're  the 
 first  guy  second  guy  third  guy 
 get  ready  going  to  room  and  flooding  you 
 must  be  that  person  on  that  door  Oh  get 
 ready  to  open  it  thinking  to  yourself  if 
 I  die  so  be  it 
 the  only  way  you  can  go  in  that  door 
 there's  no  there's  a  great  chance  that 
 you're  gonna  die  I  hated  jumping  on 
 airplanes  I  hated  shooting  guns 
 I  hated  the  job  as  a  Navy  SEAL  but  I  did 
 it  because  I  wanted  to  change  myself  so 
 my  whole  thing  is  if  you're  gonna  choose 
 to  open  that  [ __ ]  door  in  Iraq  or 
 Afghanistan  open  the  [ __ ]  go  in 
 hard  because  they're  gonna  remember  you 
 by  slowly  opening  it  and  peeking  in  so 
 if  you're  gonna  open  it  and  you  made  the 
 mind  open  it  don't  crack  it  open  open 
 the  [ __ ]  door  go  in  that's  what  like 
 if  your  children  do  if  you  choose  to  do 
 something  attacking  because  they're 
 gonna  remember  you  that's  not  a  tactic 
 so  I  want  to  be  remembered  you  can  hate 
 me  but  one  thing  you  can't  say  about  me 
 I  didn't  attack  it  might  work  Avenue  I 
 choose  I  wouldn't  be  the  very  best  and 
 the  very  best  may  not  be  I'm  number  one 
 the  very  bestest  did  I  leave  everything 
 inside  of  me  out  there  so  attacking  it's 
 not  like  I  want  to  win  this  or  win  that 
 or  be  the  best  the  best  is  I'm  running 
 against  myself  and  everything  I  do  and 
 that's  and  that's  what  I  attacked  I 
 attacked  myself  I'm  always  questioning 
 myself  I'm  always  holding  myself 
 accountable  the  accountability  mirror  is 
 something  that  I  kind  of  came  up  with  in 
 high  school  like  I  said  I  started 
 shaving  my  head  not  16 
 and  I  got  caught  up  in  trying  to  impress 
 so  many  people  because  no  one  liked  me 
 so  I  developed  so  many  different 
 identities  let  me  sag  my  pants  you  know 
 let  me  okay  let  me  pull  my  pants  up  let 
 me  let  me  talk  this  way  we're  actors 
 whether  it  be  this  way  or  or  whatever 
 the  hell  it  may  be  God  God  so  many 
 different  things  I  did  try  to  fit  in 
 with  so  many  different  groups  that  when 
 you  look  in  the  mirror  that's  the  one 
 person  you  can't  watch  so  every  morning 
 I  would  shave  my  head  thank  God  I 
 reflect  back  on  some  of  the  lies  I  may 
 have  told  somebody  or  some  of  the  ways  I 
 acted  I  ain't  feel  comfortable  doing  and 
 I  did  it  to  impress  other  normal  people 
 the  key  word  there  is  normal  everyday 
 people  I  was  trying  to  make  other  people 
 like  me  how  pathetic  is  that  so  I  did 
 this  mirror  would  always  tell  me  my  I 
 got  my  reflection  to  say  God  you  are  a 
 pathetic  man 
 how  did  I  feel  every  day  to  be  this  way 
 so  I  would  just  start  having  myself 
 accountable  ha  how  did  I  attack  today 
 how  did  I  attack  yesterday  and  if  I 
 didn't  do  something  I  was  proud  of  I 
 write  down  a  sticky  note  and  I  would  fix 
 it  so  then  my  senior  year  in  high  school 
 it  was  a  totally  different  David  God  I 
 you  know  I  wanted  to  sit  the  cool  guy 
 wants  to  go  man  I  know  even  though 
 everyone's  calling  me  a  [ __ ]  on  time  I 
 wanted  to  try  to  act  like  somebody  I 
 wasn't  so  I  could  fit  in  and  I  sold  my 
 soul  to  the  devil  you  know  trying  to  act 
 like  no  I'm  David  [ __ ]  guy 
 that's  who  I  and  so  I  wrote  down  on  a 
 piece  of  paper 
 [ __ ]  the  table  sit  by  your  [ __ ]  self 
 and  that's  what  I  did  and  guess  what 
 happened  my  table  became  a  table  people 
 started  sitting  in  my  movie  I  watched 
 all  timeless  Rocky  great  choice  rocky 
 one  and  I  related  to  Rocky  a  lot  because 
 of  Kenny  know  what  a  smart  guy  just 
 tried  real  hard  and  the  one  scene  that  I 
 related  a  lot  of  my  life  to  still  in 
 this  day  was  Rocky  one  round  14  and  this 
 one  I  got  taking  souls  front  if  you  look 
 at  round  14  of  rocky  one  Apollo  is 
 beating  the  [ __ ]  out  of  running  rocky 
 falls  down  in  this  corner 
 Mickey  saying  stay  down  stay  down  rocky 
 didn't  hear  a  [ __ ]  soul  Apollo  active 
 knocked  it  down  turns  around  hands  in 
 the  air  like  I  finally  knocked  down  this 
 animal 
 Apollo  doesn't  know  it  but  Rocky  is 
 getting  up  a  power  turns  around  the 
 second  knocking  yourself  and  a  power  lip 
 set  rocky  and  Apollo  looks  at  him  with 
 the  look  of  like  rocky  just  took  his 
 soul  he  keep  a  Polish  aches  his  head  and 
 rocky  has  his  gloves  and  emotions 
 towards  Apollo  come  on  [ __ ]  I'm 
 still  here  so  the  image  in  my  mind  of  a 
 man  was  not  one  that  had  earrings 
 Shaggy's  pants  I  had  this  image  in  my 
 head  and  I  was  going  to  fulfill  that  and 
 I  didn't  do  any  trends  I  stopped 
 trending  I  stopped  being  this  guy  who 
 whatever  was  new  [ __ ]  it  that's  not  what 
 I  believe  in  I'm  doing  this  this  is  what 
 I  want  to  be  this  what  I'm  gonna  be 
 when  I  was  out  I  had  time  to  reflect  on 
 all  I've  accomplished  and  that  was  the 
 first  time  in  my  life  where  I  sat  back 
 and  said  Wow 
 because  only  I  I  may  be  telling  you  some 
 of  the  story  I  know  the  exact  truth  of 
 how  brutal  my  life  was  and  how  I 
 shouldn't  be  on  this  show  today  and  how 
 the  mind  and  how  beautiful  it  is  so  what 
 brings  me  joy  and  happiness  is  knowing 
 how  beautiful  the  mind  is  and  I'm  one  of 
 the  few  people  that  didn't  read  about  it 
 didn't  experience  to  do  some  some  drug  I 
 got  to  experience  the  beauty  of  true 
 [ __ ]  willpower  true 
 [ __ ]  you  I'm  gonna  fail  I'm  gonna 
 [ __ ]  fail  I'm  gonna  [ __ ]  fail  I'm 
 gonna  [ __ ]  fail  and  I  will  succeed 
 just  me  talking  about  that  gives  me  a 
 feeling  I  know  what  I  did  and  I  don't 
 need  to  travel  somewhere  or  they  have 
 this  I  have  that  I  have  it  all  here  in 
 my  mind 
 the  beauty  is  remembering  this  young 
 dumb  but  people  called  [ __ ]  is  now 
 where  I'm  at  today  and  that  is  when  you 
 finally  get  to  that  point  for  me  it's 
 forever  lasting  peace  I'm  doing  it  I 
 could  die  right  now  on  this  show  and 
 I'll  be  happy  man  that's  that's  my 
 happiness  is  my  reflection  on  the 
 suffering  of  my  journey  knowing  I  never 
 quit  nor  was  I  got  it  by  anybody  on  this 
 earth  I  was  guided  by  something  much 
 more  powerful  and  I  listened  and  I  chose 
 the  path  of  most  resistance  talent  not 
 required  I  don't  judge  people  out 
 criticize  you  you  will  be  a  douchebag 
 and  being  a  stand  that  love  this  country 
 you  everyone  do  I  don't  care  man 
 I've  fought  for  this  country  for  you  to 
 do  you  and  I  and  all  about  you  doing  you 
 because  I'm  gonna  [ __ ]  do  me  and  I'm 
 gonna  do  me  in  time  [ __ ]  dead  who  are 
 you  at  the  core  of  your  soul  and  if  he 
 can  can't  answer  that  question  our 
 conversations  over  I  can't  say  [ __ ]  to 
 if  you  don't  know  who  you  are  if  you 
 don't  know  who  you  are  I  can't  tell  you 
 who  you  are 
 hopefully  I  can  help  people  that  believe 
 that  they're  much  less  than  with  a 
 two-yard  help  them  find  greatness  in 
 themselves  and  greatness  isn't  running 
 towards  it  miles  at  a  time  or  doing 
 4,000  flips  are  being  a  seal  greatness 
 is  whatever  the  hell  you  dreamed  of  in 
 your  own  mind  you  got  to  first  see  it 
 you  got  for  us  create  this  vision  in 
 your  mind  and  then  that's  when  I  come 
 into  play  once  you  create  this  vision  in 
 your  mind  it's  how  am  I  going  to  get 
 there 
 it's  the  the  business  created  is  inside 
 of  you  so  until  you  create  that  I'm 
 nobody  to  you  we  all  we  are  all  great  no 
 matter  if  if  you  think  you're  dumb  and 
 maybe  we  think  you're  fat  no  matter  if 
 you  are  fat  no  Matt  have  you  been 
 bullied  or  no  matter  if  you  just  got 
 back  from  Iraq  or  Afghanistan  and  you 
 have  no  legs  or  your  arms  or  whatever 
 man 
 we  all  have  greatness  it  just  you  got  to 
 find  the  courage  you  got  to  find  the 
 courage  to  put  your  Bose  headphones  on 
 and  silence  the  noise  out  of  this  world 
 and  to  find  it  and  the  funding  comes  out 
 there  but  it's  going  to  take  hard  work 
 courage  self-discipline  it's  gonna  take 
 all  the  non-cognitive  skills 
 it's  the  non-cognitive  skills  that  sets 
 you  apart  from  everybody  else  and  and 
 that's  what  it's  all  about
