[00:04] it took a while to get to that point
[00:06] where enough was enough
[00:09] what happened I came home one night from
[00:12] work spraying for cockroaches and long
[00:17] story short I turned on the Discovery
[00:19] Channel I saw some guys going through
[00:21] Navy SEAL training and they're going
[00:23] through hell week and they were getting
[00:24] their ass just beat you know in out of
[00:27] the water
[00:28] guys ringing the bell there was
[00:31] suffering and I was waiting like 297
[00:34] pounds and I had to make a change in my
[00:37] life I wasn't going anywhere and I was
[00:39] exactly what everybody said I was going
[00:41] to be which was nothing I came from a
[00:43] horrible background I got called [ __ ]
[00:45] every day of my life growing up lived in
[00:47] a small town the Klan headquarters at
[00:49] that time was about 20 minutes from
[00:54] where I lived the one of the high ups in
[00:58] the KKK son sat behind me two classes so
[01:01] he called me a [ __ ] a long time I got
[01:03] my first car they spray print [ __ ]
[01:04] we're gonna kill you on it so I was just
[01:07] an insecure scared kid
[01:09] and the only way I could find myself was
[01:14] to put myself through the worst thing
[01:17] possible one time this this person drew
[01:20] a picture of me and you know I said
[01:21] we're going to kill you [ __ ] on my
[01:22] Spanish notebook and I took it to my
[01:24] principal and my principal said they
[01:27] spell [ __ ] Niger that was the best
[01:29] advice you can give me so long story
[01:31] short what I realized was no one was
[01:33] here to help me and the feeling I had
[01:35] every morning I started shaving my hair
[01:37] not sixteen years old
[01:38] in the feeling I had every morning I
[01:40] looked in the mirror was horrible and I
[01:44] don't wanna feel like anymore and how I
[01:45] felt was a kid going nowhere a kid that
[01:48] was scared and most kids will accept
[01:50] that and look for help but the best
[01:52] thing that happened to me no one helped
[01:54] me no one felt sorry for me I had to
[01:58] figure out I wasn't going to be a punk
[02:00] kid all my life so in a way I could turn
[02:03] around was to suffer I had to build
[02:06] calluses in my brain the same way I
[02:09] built calluses on my hands so I brought
[02:11] the gift of the world's records for
[02:13] pulse a long time ago but I felt in it
[02:15] twice and I did 67,000 pull-ups in
[02:19] trying to break this record so to do
[02:22] four thousand thirty pull-ups I had to
[02:24] do 67 thousand for training for them Wow
[02:27] and so what I realized is for me to
[02:30] become the man I wanted to become I saw
[02:33] myself as the weakest person God ever
[02:35] created but I never blamed God for
[02:37] anything he did to me so I wanted to
[02:40] change that to be the hardest man ever
[02:43] created am i that I don't know but you
[02:45] had to have a goal and my goal when I
[02:48] was sitting there not going to school
[02:50] being bullied being having no
[02:53] self-esteem
[02:53] my goal was the only person that's gonna
[02:56] turn this person around is me you know
[02:58] what I can turned around is put myself
[03:00] through the worst things possible a
[03:04] human being can ever endure and I'd be
[03:06] the only way that I can build this brain
[03:09] to handle anything that comes in front
[03:11] of him callus in my mind
[03:13] through pain and suffering but what I
[03:18] find so interesting is how we as a
[03:22] species run from pain we run from
[03:26] suffering I firmly believe that you need
[03:29] something that is brutal is difficult is
[03:33] hardship it knocks you off Center it
[03:36] makes you feel bad because in the
[03:38] process of rebuilding and clawing back
[03:39] from that climbing up then you can
[03:41] become something but you unless you've
[03:43] been tested unless you've gone through
[03:45] the wringer you've got no hope so how do
[03:47] you take somebody that you love and
[03:48] force them through that because I'm
[03:50] gonna say the exact opposite of what the
[03:52] world today's world is saying so we read
[03:55] a bunch of books nowadays as humans we
[03:57] we want to find out how to be someone
[04:00] else what we don't do is we don't go
[04:03] inside so literally turn yourself inside
[04:06] out read the book that since I feel like
[04:08] we're writing a book every day of our
[04:10] lives
[04:10] but we never read that book you have to
[04:12] look inside of yourself to see what you
[04:14] really want what are you passionate
[04:16] about we use these words and these
[04:18] little phrases of only the strong
[04:20] survive and also the crab there's all
[04:22] just [ __ ] words I get so tired of
[04:25] hearing people just talking like right
[04:26] now someone may think Gaga is talking
[04:29] but you don't know me so when I speak I
[04:32] speak from Pasha I speak from experience
[04:33] I speak from suffering the only way I
[04:36] believe this is just my experience in
[04:38] life the only way you're ever going to
[04:41] get to the other side of this journey
[04:44] is you have gotten to supper to grow to
[04:48] grow you must suffer and some people get
[04:52] into the moment but they have to see
[04:54] what their journey is to start their
[04:56] journey several people live to be a
[04:57] hundred years old
[04:58] they have great lives and have great
[05:00] kids the kids go to college officers
[05:01] dumping but somewhere in their life
[05:04] there was a point where they had their
[05:06] decision to make
[05:07] they can go left or right on this path
[05:10] left was the easy route right was a hard
[05:13] round a lot of people take the easy
[05:16] route and they had a good life that way
[05:18] but the better life was going to the
[05:20] right side and you may have 20 years of
[05:23] pain and suffering to get past it but a
[05:25] lot of us died never truly starting our
[05:27] journey got to start to journey it may
[05:29] suck but it will it will come out to her
[05:32] side when you're coach every day we're
[05:35] seeing who we are as people when I was
[05:36] growing up I I lied for people to accept
[05:40] me because I did accept myself so I
[05:42] would make up stories so that you would
[05:44] accept me into your world I would uh
[05:46] everything I did was for someone else to
[05:49] like me it was until I started reading
[05:51] the whole book about how pathetic I was
[05:53] as human being I could play my dad I can
[05:55] blame kids at school I could blame
[05:57] having health issues ATD my mom not
[05:59] being around I could blame a lot of
[06:01] people and that's the book I was reading
[06:03] and I put it off on everybody else it
[06:06] was until I say you know what for me to
[06:08] fix this I get a read what the hell what
[06:10] the [ __ ] is wrong with David ah it's not
[06:12] not blaming anybody read my book is okay
[06:15] I'm afraid of my shadow how can I
[06:18] overcome that go in and militare and get
[06:21] your ass kicked
[06:22] do things you hate to do be
[06:24] uncomfortable every [ __ ] day of your
[06:26] life Roger that
[06:27] I'm not the smartest kid in the world
[06:29] okay it says somebody say oh you're
[06:32] smart I will say it to yourself I said
[06:34] to myself no I'm a dumb [ __ ]
[06:36] okay Roger that how you get smarter
[06:39] educate yourself so the things that we
[06:42] work from we run it from the truth we
[06:46] run it from the truth man so the only
[06:48] way I became successful was going
[06:51] towards the truth as painful and as
[06:53] brutal as it is it changed me it allowed
[06:58] me to become in my own right Who am
[07:01] today I knew nothing about
[07:03] ultramarathons
[07:04] I hadn't run America I knew nothing
[07:06] about this world
[07:07] so our guru that little the top 10
[07:10] hardest races in world and what comes up
[07:13] as a bad water 135 so her 35 mile race
[07:16] through Death Valley the summer time I
[07:18] thought was a race when you run like 20
[07:21] miles set up camp you know
[07:23] barbecue outside and then go run some
[07:26] more the next day so I called the ranks
[07:28] director up at the race and said hey
[07:29] Chris and there was Chris Koster
[07:30] I want to do your race
[07:34] [Music]
[07:36] I am put running shoes on over a year I
[07:38] was a big-time power lifter I lifted
[07:41] weights heavy that's what I did
[07:42] I just got back home from Iraq we
[07:44] stripped the freefall school and then
[07:46] this happened so I called Chris costumed
[07:49] up on a Wednesday he says look man the
[07:51] only way you can qualify for my races to
[07:53] run a hundred miles at one time in 24
[07:56] hours or less and he said if you qualify
[07:58] by running hundred miles or less in 24
[08:01] hours I would consider you my race I'll
[08:03] cut to the chase I signed up for this
[08:06] race it's called a San Diego one day
[08:08] were you running to run a one-mile track
[08:10] for 24 hours to city miles you can get
[08:12] my goal was a hundred pounds so I got 2
[08:18] miles 70 and I cleared 70 pounds my 1213
[08:22] hours pretty quickly but I was done my
[08:25] feet were broken
[08:26] I was stretched fractured shin splints
[08:28] muscles were tearing I was in bad shape
[08:31] I was eating rich crackers and drinks
[08:33] and that's all I had no water didn't
[08:37] know what the hell I was doing out there
[08:38] so I sat down at Mile 70 at this time I
[08:42] was married and I look at my wife and I
[08:46] was like oh I messed up bad so I
[08:50] literally starts to turn white Here I am
[08:53] I'm all [ __ ] up in this chair I'm at
[08:56] Mile seven if they got 30 [ __ ] miles
[08:58] to go I'm jacked up I got to go to the
[09:00] bathroom the bathrooms like 20 feet from
[09:02] me supporter party I can't get out of
[09:05] the [ __ ] chair so I'm peeing blood
[09:07] down my leg whoa Cooper not my [ __ ]
[09:10] pack
[09:10] and I got 30 miles to go and I'm I can't
[09:15] stand up can my my blood pressures all
[09:17] messed up
[09:17] I've been in three whole weeks Ranger
[09:19] school overcome so many obstacles in my
[09:22] life this last 30 miles of this race is
[09:25] when I realized a human being is not so
[09:31] human anymore
[09:33] [Music]
[09:36] we have the ability to go in such a
[09:39] space if you're willing to suffer and I
[09:42] mean suffer your brain and your body
[09:44] once connected together you can do
[09:47] anything and this 30 miles was the
[09:50] life-changing moment I was out of it I
[09:54] was in the worst pain in my entire life
[09:56] I was to me on the brink of death and I
[10:02] was able to chunk this 30 damn miles
[10:04] into small pieces I was so driven and
[10:07] I'm not gonna say motivated cuz
[10:09] motivations crap motivation comes and
[10:11] goes when you're driven whatever's in
[10:14] front of you will get destroyed so I sat
[10:18] in this chair and I was so driven to
[10:20] succeed in this race in it and at this
[10:23] time
[10:23] everyone's rethinking about the guys
[10:25] that died and I'm not gonna lie to you I
[10:28] was this became a personal thing this
[10:33] became me against this race me against
[10:35] the kids that called me [ __ ] me against
[10:37] me it just became something that took so
[10:40] good so violently personally and I broke
[10:44] this thing down into small pieces I said
[10:46] okay I got to get nutrition I gotta be
[10:48] able to stand up before I can get off
[10:50] his current and off his chair and be
[10:51] able to go 30 miles so I went through
[10:53] all these small steps and I was able to
[10:55] stand up
[10:57] then I'm standing up I was literally
[10:59] walking around with my wife at the time
[11:01] and she goes she's not gonna make the
[11:03] time she goes you're working on me
[11:04] you're walking like 30 72 hours I got
[11:08] tomorrow 81 and the second she said that
[11:10] I'm not gonna make the time I ran the
[11:13] last 19 miles non-stop I had to put
[11:16] compression tape on my own and I had so
[11:20] this was years ago I had literally the
[11:24] size of half dollars I had to get
[11:28] compression tape and I kicked up my
[11:30] ankles and i taked up my feet and that's
[11:34] how I got through that race like my
[11:35] shins hurt so bad and have her stress
[11:38] fractures that's the only way I could
[11:40] continue on was I taped it so I wasn't
[11:42] doing the flexor motion that that
[11:44] activates your your shins
[11:47] so I taped my ankles and my shins up and
[11:51] I got that from because of my third hell
[11:53] week they were let me go back to no
[11:55] training so I literally went through all
[11:59] the buds my last SEAL training my stress
[12:01] fractures how I get it because I would
[12:04] take my ankles all the way up to my cab
[12:07] every morning since the first hour the
[12:09] pain was excruciating but what happened
[12:12] is
[12:13] that did that every single day
[12:16] people may listen to this and say this
[12:19] guy is sadistic
[12:21] he's crazy know if you know how I came
[12:23] up you realize I was just a scared kid
[12:27] that found drive and passion to be
[12:30] something much better than what he
[12:32] thought that's all it is my biggest
[12:34] advice to get everybody in the world is
[12:36] like I say you live in an external world
[12:39] everything is is you got to see it touch
[12:42] it it's external if you can for the rest
[12:47] of your life
[12:47] live inside of yourself stop listening
[12:51] to people who are calling you fat gay
[12:52] transsexual [ __ ] everything that is
[12:55] makes no sense all these insecure people
[12:57] putting their insecurities on you you
[12:59] gotta flush it out you got to just be
[13:01] whoever the hell God or whatever the
[13:03] hell you believe in if you believe in
[13:04] nothing but yourself I don't care what
[13:06] it is you're gonna take everything and
[13:08] throw it away you have to believe in one
[13:12] thing and that is yourself and and I'm
[13:15] not saying don't believe in God what you
[13:17] believe in but right now so you define
[13:19] greatness in yourself you're not gonna
[13:22] find it by looking in a book or if I
[13:25] even hearing me I may give you the spark
[13:28] but you've got to go inside yourself to
[13:31] find it and that means you gotta be
[13:33] quiet shut the [ __ ] up go on a room
[13:36] stop talking search your soul search
[13:39] your mind search your abilities and
[13:42] you'll find it but if you're not looking
[13:44] for it you won't find it so you got to
[13:47] go start your journey and the journey
[13:49] starts with you finding why the hell in
[13:52] like you
[13:53] why am I here if you don't know that you
[13:56] will live the rest your life searching
[13:58] always asking a question cookie jar is
[14:02] something that I've made up of all the
[14:04] failures of my life all the things that
[14:07] I was I failed and I went back I failed
[14:10] I went back and I finally succeeded all
[14:12] the things that kicked my ass I put them
[14:14] all in the cookie jar because at times
[14:15] of hell even the hardest men in times of
[14:19] suffering what we do was we forget how
[14:21] far we moving on because that's what
[14:23] suffering is suffering is a test some of
[14:25] this suffering is a true test of life
[14:28] and instead of that cookie jar travels
[14:31] in my brain so whenever I get put in a
[14:32] situation where I have poopy pants the
[14:35] lowers me mentality of oh my god life
[14:38] sucks I take a second I take the one
[14:41] second decision I step out of my life
[14:44] for one second going the cookie jar
[14:45] pull-up Oh [ __ ] you went you
[14:47] were in three whole weeks and finished
[14:49] to one of those topics a guy died in
[14:51] because it was so bad oh he want her
[14:53] [ __ ] badass I put it back in
[14:59] the cookie jar and I remember who the
[15:01] [ __ ] I really am I'm not the kid that
[15:03] guy that was calling me I'm not the
[15:04] scared kid this is who I am it's a
[15:07] reminder of who you truly are at the
[15:09] core of yourself but what I was saying
[15:12] to myself the whole time on that track
[15:13] in it and this is what I say to myself
[15:16] self talk and visualization of the two
[15:19] keys to my success I believed for that
[15:24] last time 19 miles I was indestructible
[15:27] because I took myself in that chair
[15:31] crapping up my back peeing blood in my
[15:33] leg shin splints stress fractures I used
[15:36] all that for motivation versus
[15:37] negativity I use it for motivation I
[15:40] said to myself who on this [ __ ]
[15:44] we'd still be going right now you are
[15:48] you are you got to be the hardest
[15:52] [ __ ] on the planet is it true I
[15:54] don't give a [ __ ] at that time it got me
[15:59] to the finish line of that [ __ ] race
[16:00] I believed it
[16:02] I believe it today I believed it enough
[16:06] to where my body said he's not gonna
[16:09] stop and that's I took all the negative
[16:13] things I need to go to the hospital this
[16:15] and that and I use you who they don't
[16:21] even think about taping stress fractures
[16:25] all those things I'd use for motivation
[16:27] so if you think that I'm some unhappy
[16:30] guy you're wrong
[16:31] having lived a life I've lived in seeing
[16:35] the other side not being afraid to
[16:37] attack what was in front of me has made
[16:40] me happy
[16:41] say that again in fact let me make sure
[16:43] I understood it getting to the point
[16:46] where you're not afraid to face the
[16:47] thing on the other side of the door that
[16:49] wants to attack you has made you happy
[16:51] right what the dark side is is we all
[16:55] have a cookie jar and we all have a jar
[17:00] of [ __ ] or [ __ ] just it's just ain't
[17:03] good night and in hell week what they do
[17:07] in hell week okay this is where I really
[17:08] went to the dark side what they're doing
[17:11] hell because they design how weak to
[17:14] find your flaws and they do a really
[17:18] good job of that it's 130 hours of
[17:20] continuous training you may get two
[17:21] hours of sleep and they beat the [ __ ]
[17:24] out of you and find everything wrong
[17:27] with your mentality and then they start
[17:30] helping and that's the beauty of it and
[17:33] for me I'm not some not no nasty guy
[17:37] giving guy you know I don't have a great
[17:39] bit of talent in anything so what got me
[17:42] through horrible times was the dark side
[17:44] whereas I created my name is David
[17:47] Goggin I created Goggins Goggins is the
[17:53] guy that can take anything you put in
[17:56] front of them you want to break my
[17:58] [ __ ] legs so be it
[18:00] I have a way of going to a place I could
[18:02] did in that race where all the pain and
[18:05] suffering that they put on top of me in
[18:07] hell week I will reverse that pain and
[18:10] suffering and I will take your soul so
[18:13] every instructor that put me through but
[18:16] it's my job what drove me was I wanted
[18:20] you to go home that night after you beat
[18:22] the living [ __ ] out of me and I smiled
[18:25] in your face I wanted you to feel worse
[18:28] than I did and you were going home to a
[18:30] nice warm bed with your wife or your
[18:33] kids and a nice meal and I was still out
[18:35] there in the grip suffering for another
[18:38] hundred Alex I want you to think about
[18:40] me knowing that I'm comfortable being
[18:44] very unfuckin comfortable and I want you
[18:46] to think about when you would do [ __ ]
[18:48] healthy how uncomfortable you were how
[18:50] bad you wanted to quit you knowing I'm
[18:53] not thinking that [ __ ] so the dark
[18:55] side is something that I've designed
[18:57] it's an evil place I can go that very
[19:02] few things can hurt
[19:05] I used to hurt you're trying to put on
[19:07] me I flip it upside down and use it you
[19:11] try use it for kryptonite and now it's
[19:14] power pillars for me I'm I'm your little
[19:17] strength I flip negative into positive
[19:19] targets
[19:23] people I said man you cuss all the
[19:25] [ __ ] time why well I hate to say it
[19:28] the best way for me to get how I feel
[19:30] across I can't see any say you know what
[19:33] I went through hell week and man it was
[19:34] it was really hard know that
[19:37] [ __ ]
[19:38] takes your damn soul rips it inside out
[19:41] and then they say now we're going to
[19:45] [ __ ] start it it allows me to express
[19:49] where I was at at a point of my life if
[19:53] I don't give you all of me why the hell
[19:56] am I here
[19:56] why how will you learn for me people
[20:00] take so much offense to me you will
[20:02] never learn from people if we always
[20:04] tap-dance around the truth by finding
[20:07] the right words I don't hurt you because
[20:09] you have thin skin no tighten up people
[20:13] it's okay
[20:14] trust me it's okay you might be called
[20:16] [ __ ] one day it's okay you might be
[20:20] cause some Jewish word or some [ __ ] or
[20:23] gay word it's okay let them call you
[20:25] that what are you going to do now they
[20:27] don't own your life how are you going to
[20:29] control that how are you going to flip
[20:31] it upside down and say Roger that now
[20:33] I'm going to harness this [ __ ] and
[20:35] you're read about me years from now how
[20:39] that's the question are you going to do
[20:41] thicken your skin become more believe
[20:44] it'll be afraid of the reflection in the
[20:47] mirror that's all you can be afraid of
[20:49] once you overcome the reflection in the
[20:52] mirror you've done it the younger
[20:56] generation quits not everybody so I got
[21:00] it I got put it people get to butthurt
[21:02] so not everybody most of this generation
[21:05] quits the second they get talk to you
[21:09] did this wrong you did this wrong or
[21:11] they get yelled at it so Lisa's number
[21:13] two be great nowadays because everybody
[21:16] else's most people are weak this this is
[21:20] a softer generation so if you have any
[21:22] mental toughness any of any ability give
[21:25] any fraction of self-discipline the
[21:29] ability to not want to do it but still
[21:32] do it
[21:33] people have a hard thing understand I
[21:36] hate to run and it makes me so crazy it
[21:39] doesn't need more people why did you run
[21:42] if you hate it
[21:43] what are you talking about I don't want
[21:46] to take showers and eat either I hate
[21:48] that too there's the whole that's a life
[21:50] man that innit
[21:53] it wasn't until I changed that mentality
[21:55] then I became somebody I hate it going
[21:58] to school so I guess what I was dumb as
[22:00] [ __ ] that's what will one plus one is
[22:03] two but if you can get through to doing
[22:07] things that you hate to do on the other
[22:10] side is greatness
[22:15] that's what people are saying by me
[22:18] running iein Calais in my mind I'm not
[22:20] training for a race I'm training for
[22:24] life I'm training for the time when I
[22:26] get that two o'clock in the morning call
[22:28] that my mom is dead or something happens
[22:31] tragic in life I don't fall apart I'm
[22:35] training my mind and my body my spirit
[22:37] so it's all one so I can handle what
[22:39] life is gonna throw at me because to
[22:41] life I've lived it throws a whole bunch
[22:43] at you and if you're not physically
[22:45] immensely prepared for that you're just
[22:48] gonna crumble and you're good for nobody
[22:50] when you are on one side of the door and
[22:53] your mind is racing because on the other
[22:56] side of that door it could be no one it
[22:59] could be four guys with four ak-47s that
[23:02] that door are you about to open can be
[23:04] trapped so once you open it boom your
[23:07] legs are gone so there's a thousand
[23:10] things you think about when you're the
[23:12] first guy second guy third guy
[23:14] get ready going to room and flooding you
[23:17] must be that person on that door Oh get
[23:20] ready to open it thinking to yourself if
[23:23] I die so be it
[23:27] the only way you can go in that door
[23:30] there's no there's a great chance that
[23:31] you're gonna die I hated jumping on
[23:33] airplanes I hated shooting guns
[23:36] I hated the job as a Navy SEAL but I did
[23:39] it because I wanted to change myself so
[23:43] my whole thing is if you're gonna choose
[23:44] to open that [ __ ] door in Iraq or
[23:46] Afghanistan open the [ __ ] go in
[23:48] hard because they're gonna remember you
[23:51] by slowly opening it and peeking in so
[23:56] if you're gonna open it and you made the
[23:58] mind open it don't crack it open open
[24:01] the [ __ ] door go in that's what like
[24:02] if your children do if you choose to do
[24:05] something attacking because they're
[24:08] gonna remember you that's not a tactic
[24:10] so I want to be remembered you can hate
[24:13] me but one thing you can't say about me
[24:15] I didn't attack it might work Avenue I
[24:18] choose I wouldn't be the very best and
[24:21] the very best may not be I'm number one
[24:24] the very bestest did I leave everything
[24:28] inside of me out there so attacking it's
[24:32] not like I want to win this or win that
[24:34] or be the best the best is I'm running
[24:37] against myself and everything I do and
[24:40] that's and that's what I attacked I
[24:42] attacked myself I'm always questioning
[24:45] myself I'm always holding myself
[24:46] accountable the accountability mirror is
[24:48] something that I kind of came up with in
[24:51] high school like I said I started
[24:53] shaving my head not 16
[24:55] and I got caught up in trying to impress
[24:57] so many people because no one liked me
[24:59] so I developed so many different
[25:02] identities let me sag my pants you know
[25:05] let me okay let me pull my pants up let
[25:07] me let me talk this way we're actors
[25:09] whether it be this way or or whatever
[25:11] the hell it may be God God so many
[25:13] different things I did try to fit in
[25:15] with so many different groups that when
[25:19] you look in the mirror that's the one
[25:20] person you can't watch so every morning
[25:27] I would shave my head thank God I
[25:28] reflect back on some of the lies I may
[25:31] have told somebody or some of the ways I
[25:34] acted I ain't feel comfortable doing and
[25:35] I did it to impress other normal people
[25:38] the key word there is normal everyday
[25:40] people I was trying to make other people
[25:43] like me how pathetic is that so I did
[25:48] this mirror would always tell me my I
[25:50] got my reflection to say God you are a
[25:52] pathetic man
[25:53] how did I feel every day to be this way
[25:56] so I would just start having myself
[25:58] accountable ha how did I attack today
[26:00] how did I attack yesterday and if I
[26:03] didn't do something I was proud of I
[26:04] write down a sticky note and I would fix
[26:07] it so then my senior year in high school
[26:11] it was a totally different David God I
[26:14] you know I wanted to sit the cool guy
[26:16] wants to go man I know even though
[26:17] everyone's calling me a [ __ ] on time I
[26:19] wanted to try to act like somebody I
[26:22] wasn't so I could fit in and I sold my
[26:25] soul to the devil you know trying to act
[26:28] like no I'm David [ __ ] guy
[26:31] that's who I and so I wrote down on a
[26:34] piece of paper
[26:34] [ __ ] the table sit by your [ __ ] self
[26:38] and that's what I did and guess what
[26:40] happened my table became a table people
[26:44] started sitting in my movie I watched
[26:45] all timeless Rocky great choice rocky
[26:49] one and I related to Rocky a lot because
[26:53] of Kenny know what a smart guy just
[26:56] tried real hard and the one scene that I
[27:00] related a lot of my life to still in
[27:03] this day was Rocky one round 14 and this
[27:08] one I got taking souls front if you look
[27:10] at round 14 of rocky one Apollo is
[27:14] beating the [ __ ] out of running rocky
[27:17] falls down in this corner
[27:18] Mickey saying stay down stay down rocky
[27:21] didn't hear a [ __ ] soul Apollo active
[27:23] knocked it down turns around hands in
[27:26] the air like I finally knocked down this
[27:29] animal
[27:32] Apollo doesn't know it but Rocky is
[27:34] getting up a power turns around the
[27:37] second knocking yourself and a power lip
[27:41] set rocky and Apollo looks at him with
[27:44] the look of like rocky just took his
[27:47] soul he keep a Polish aches his head and
[27:51] rocky has his gloves and emotions
[27:53] towards Apollo come on [ __ ] I'm
[27:55] still here so the image in my mind of a
[27:59] man was not one that had earrings
[28:04] Shaggy's pants I had this image in my
[28:07] head and I was going to fulfill that and
[28:11] I didn't do any trends I stopped
[28:14] trending I stopped being this guy who
[28:16] whatever was new [ __ ] it that's not what
[28:19] I believe in I'm doing this this is what
[28:21] I want to be this what I'm gonna be
[28:26] when I was out I had time to reflect on
[28:29] all I've accomplished and that was the
[28:32] first time in my life where I sat back
[28:34] and said Wow
[28:35] because only I I may be telling you some
[28:38] of the story I know the exact truth of
[28:41] how brutal my life was and how I
[28:45] shouldn't be on this show today and how
[28:48] the mind and how beautiful it is so what
[28:53] brings me joy and happiness is knowing
[28:56] how beautiful the mind is and I'm one of
[29:00] the few people that didn't read about it
[29:03] didn't experience to do some some drug I
[29:07] got to experience the beauty of true
[29:10] [ __ ] willpower true
[29:13] [ __ ] you I'm gonna fail I'm gonna
[29:17] [ __ ] fail I'm gonna [ __ ] fail I'm
[29:19] gonna [ __ ] fail and I will succeed
[29:23] just me talking about that gives me a
[29:26] feeling I know what I did and I don't
[29:30] need to travel somewhere or they have
[29:32] this I have that I have it all here in
[29:34] my mind
[29:36] the beauty is remembering this young
[29:38] dumb but people called [ __ ] is now
[29:43] where I'm at today and that is when you
[29:46] finally get to that point for me it's
[29:48] forever lasting peace I'm doing it I
[29:52] could die right now on this show and
[29:55] I'll be happy man that's that's my
[29:59] happiness is my reflection on the
[30:02] suffering of my journey knowing I never
[30:04] quit nor was I got it by anybody on this
[30:08] earth I was guided by something much
[30:12] more powerful and I listened and I chose
[30:15] the path of most resistance talent not
[30:19] required I don't judge people out
[30:20] criticize you you will be a douchebag
[30:22] and being a stand that love this country
[30:23] you everyone do I don't care man
[30:26] I've fought for this country for you to
[30:29] do you and I and all about you doing you
[30:32] because I'm gonna [ __ ] do me and I'm
[30:34] gonna do me in time [ __ ] dead who are
[30:36] you at the core of your soul and if he
[30:40] can can't answer that question our
[30:42] conversations over I can't say [ __ ] to
[30:45] if you don't know who you are if you
[30:48] don't know who you are I can't tell you
[30:51] who you are
[30:51] hopefully I can help people that believe
[30:54] that they're much less than with a
[30:57] two-yard help them find greatness in
[31:00] themselves and greatness isn't running
[31:03] towards it miles at a time or doing
[31:04] 4,000 flips are being a seal greatness
[31:06] is whatever the hell you dreamed of in
[31:09] your own mind you got to first see it
[31:11] you got for us create this vision in
[31:13] your mind and then that's when I come
[31:16] into play once you create this vision in
[31:17] your mind it's how am I going to get
[31:20] there
[31:20] it's the the business created is inside
[31:23] of you so until you create that I'm
[31:25] nobody to you we all we are all great no
[31:34] matter if if you think you're dumb and
[31:37] maybe we think you're fat no matter if
[31:38] you are fat no Matt have you been
[31:40] bullied or no matter if you just got
[31:42] back from Iraq or Afghanistan and you
[31:45] have no legs or your arms or whatever
[31:47] man
[31:47] we all have greatness it just you got to
[31:51] find the courage you got to find the
[31:53] courage to put your Bose headphones on
[31:55] and silence the noise out of this world
[31:59] and to find it and the funding comes out
[32:01] there but it's going to take hard work
[32:04] courage self-discipline it's gonna take
[32:07] all the non-cognitive skills
[32:09] it's the non-cognitive skills that sets
[32:12] you apart from everybody else and and
[32:16] that's what it's all about
[32:17] [Music]

## Plain Text (for processing)

it took a while to get to that point where enough was enough what happened I came home one night from work spraying for cockroaches and long story short I turned on the Discovery Channel I saw some guys going through Navy SEAL training and they're going through hell week and they were getting their ass just beat you know in out of the water guys ringing the bell there was suffering and I was waiting like 297 pounds and I had to make a change in my life I wasn't going anywhere and I was exactly what everybody said I was going to be which was nothing I came from a horrible background I got called [ __ ] every day of my life growing up lived in a small town the Klan headquarters at that time was about 20 minutes from where I lived the one of the high ups in the KKK son sat behind me two classes so he called me a [ __ ] a long time I got my first car they spray print [ __ ] we're gonna kill you on it so I was just an insecure scared kid and the only way I could find myself was to put myself through the worst thing possible one time this this person drew a picture of me and you know I said we're going to kill you [ __ ] on my Spanish notebook and I took it to my principal and my principal said they spell [ __ ] Niger that was the best advice you can give me so long story short what I realized was no one was here to help me and the feeling I had every morning I started shaving my hair not sixteen years old in the feeling I had every morning I looked in the mirror was horrible and I don't wanna feel like anymore and how I felt was a kid going nowhere a kid that was scared and most kids will accept that and look for help but the best thing that happened to me no one helped me no one felt sorry for me I had to figure out I wasn't going to be a punk kid all my life so in a way I could turn around was to suffer I had to build calluses in my brain the same way I built calluses on my hands so I brought the gift of the world's records for pulse a long time ago but I felt in it twice and I did 67,000 pull-ups in trying to break this record so to do four thousand thirty pull-ups I had to do 67 thousand for training for them Wow and so what I realized is for me to become the man I wanted to become I saw myself as the weakest person God ever created but I never blamed God for anything he did to me so I wanted to change that to be the hardest man ever created am i that I don't know but you had to have a goal and my goal when I was sitting there not going to school being bullied being having no self-esteem my goal was the only person that's gonna turn this person around is me you know what I can turned around is put myself through the worst things possible a human being can ever endure and I'd be the only way that I can build this brain to handle anything that comes in front of him callus in my mind through pain and suffering but what I find so interesting is how we as a species run from pain we run from suffering I firmly believe that you need something that is brutal is difficult is hardship it knocks you off Center it makes you feel bad because in the process of rebuilding and clawing back from that climbing up then you can become something but you unless you've been tested unless you've gone through the wringer you've got no hope so how do you take somebody that you love and force them through that because I'm gonna say the exact opposite of what the world today's world is saying so we read a bunch of books nowadays as humans we we want to find out how to be someone else what we don't do is we don't go inside so literally turn yourself inside out read the book that since I feel like we're writing a book every day of our lives but we never read that book you have to look inside of yourself to see what you really want what are you passionate about we use these words and these little phrases of only the strong survive and also the crab there's all just [ __ ] words I get so tired of hearing people just talking like right now someone may think Gaga is talking but you don't know me so when I speak I speak from Pasha I speak from experience I speak from suffering the only way I believe this is just my experience in life the only way you're ever going to get to the other side of this journey is you have gotten to supper to grow to grow you must suffer and some people get into the moment but they have to see what their journey is to start their journey several people live to be a hundred years old they have great lives and have great kids the kids go to college officers dumping but somewhere in their life there was a point where they had their decision to make they can go left or right on this path left was the easy route right was a hard round a lot of people take the easy route and they had a good life that way but the better life was going to the right side and you may have 20 years of pain and suffering to get past it but a lot of us died never truly starting our journey got to start to journey it may suck but it will it will come out to her side when you're coach every day we're seeing who we are as people when I was growing up I I lied for people to accept me because I did accept myself so I would make up stories so that you would accept me into your world I would uh everything I did was for someone else to like me it was until I started reading the whole book about how pathetic I was as human being I could play my dad I can blame kids at school I could blame having health issues ATD my mom not being around I could blame a lot of people and that's the book I was reading and I put it off on everybody else it was until I say you know what for me to fix this I get a read what the hell what the [ __ ] is wrong with David ah it's not not blaming anybody read my book is okay I'm afraid of my shadow how can I overcome that go in and militare and get your ass kicked do things you hate to do be uncomfortable every [ __ ] day of your life Roger that I'm not the smartest kid in the world okay it says somebody say oh you're smart I will say it to yourself I said to myself no I'm a dumb [ __ ] okay Roger that how you get smarter educate yourself so the things that we work from we run it from the truth we run it from the truth man so the only way I became successful was going towards the truth as painful and as brutal as it is it changed me it allowed me to become in my own right Who am today I knew nothing about ultramarathons I hadn't run America I knew nothing about this world so our guru that little the top 10 hardest races in world and what comes up as a bad water 135 so her 35 mile race through Death Valley the summer time I thought was a race when you run like 20 miles set up camp you know barbecue outside and then go run some more the next day so I called the ranks director up at the race and said hey Chris and there was Chris Koster I want to do your race [Music] I am put running shoes on over a year I was a big-time power lifter I lifted weights heavy that's what I did I just got back home from Iraq we stripped the freefall school and then this happened so I called Chris costumed up on a Wednesday he says look man the only way you can qualify for my races to run a hundred miles at one time in 24 hours or less and he said if you qualify by running hundred miles or less in 24 hours I would consider you my race I'll cut to the chase I signed up for this race it's called a San Diego one day were you running to run a one-mile track for 24 hours to city miles you can get my goal was a hundred pounds so I got 2 miles 70 and I cleared 70 pounds my 1213 hours pretty quickly but I was done my feet were broken I was stretched fractured shin splints muscles were tearing I was in bad shape I was eating rich crackers and drinks and that's all I had no water didn't know what the hell I was doing out there so I sat down at Mile 70 at this time I was married and I look at my wife and I was like oh I messed up bad so I literally starts to turn white Here I am I'm all [ __ ] up in this chair I'm at Mile seven if they got 30 [ __ ] miles to go I'm jacked up I got to go to the bathroom the bathrooms like 20 feet from me supporter party I can't get out of the [ __ ] chair so I'm peeing blood down my leg whoa Cooper not my [ __ ] pack and I got 30 miles to go and I'm I can't stand up can my my blood pressures all messed up I've been in three whole weeks Ranger school overcome so many obstacles in my life this last 30 miles of this race is when I realized a human being is not so human anymore [Music] we have the ability to go in such a space if you're willing to suffer and I mean suffer your brain and your body once connected together you can do anything and this 30 miles was the life-changing moment I was out of it I was in the worst pain in my entire life I was to me on the brink of death and I was able to chunk this 30 damn miles into small pieces I was so driven and I'm not gonna say motivated cuz motivations crap motivation comes and goes when you're driven whatever's in front of you will get destroyed so I sat in this chair and I was so driven to succeed in this race in it and at this time everyone's rethinking about the guys that died and I'm not gonna lie to you I was this became a personal thing this became me against this race me against the kids that called me [ __ ] me against me it just became something that took so good so violently personally and I broke this thing down into small pieces I said okay I got to get nutrition I gotta be able to stand up before I can get off his current and off his chair and be able to go 30 miles so I went through all these small steps and I was able to stand up then I'm standing up I was literally walking around with my wife at the time and she goes she's not gonna make the time she goes you're working on me you're walking like 30 72 hours I got tomorrow 81 and the second she said that I'm not gonna make the time I ran the last 19 miles non-stop I had to put compression tape on my own and I had so this was years ago I had literally the size of half dollars I had to get compression tape and I kicked up my ankles and i taked up my feet and that's how I got through that race like my shins hurt so bad and have her stress fractures that's the only way I could continue on was I taped it so I wasn't doing the flexor motion that that activates your your shins so I taped my ankles and my shins up and I got that from because of my third hell week they were let me go back to no training so I literally went through all the buds my last SEAL training my stress fractures how I get it because I would take my ankles all the way up to my cab every morning since the first hour the pain was excruciating but what happened is that did that every single day people may listen to this and say this guy is sadistic he's crazy know if you know how I came up you realize I was just a scared kid that found drive and passion to be something much better than what he thought that's all it is my biggest advice to get everybody in the world is like I say you live in an external world everything is is you got to see it touch it it's external if you can for the rest of your life live inside of yourself stop listening to people who are calling you fat gay transsexual [ __ ] everything that is makes no sense all these insecure people putting their insecurities on you you gotta flush it out you got to just be whoever the hell God or whatever the hell you believe in if you believe in nothing but yourself I don't care what it is you're gonna take everything and throw it away you have to believe in one thing and that is yourself and and I'm not saying don't believe in God what you believe in but right now so you define greatness in yourself you're not gonna find it by looking in a book or if I even hearing me I may give you the spark but you've got to go inside yourself to find it and that means you gotta be quiet shut the [ __ ] up go on a room stop talking search your soul search your mind search your abilities and you'll find it but if you're not looking for it you won't find it so you got to go start your journey and the journey starts with you finding why the hell in like you why am I here if you don't know that you will live the rest your life searching always asking a question cookie jar is something that I've made up of all the failures of my life all the things that I was I failed and I went back I failed I went back and I finally succeeded all the things that kicked my ass I put them all in the cookie jar because at times of hell even the hardest men in times of suffering what we do was we forget how far we moving on because that's what suffering is suffering is a test some of this suffering is a true test of life and instead of that cookie jar travels in my brain so whenever I get put in a situation where I have poopy pants the lowers me mentality of oh my god life sucks I take a second I take the one second decision I step out of my life for one second going the cookie jar pull-up Oh [ __ ] you went you were in three whole weeks and finished to one of those topics a guy died in because it was so bad oh he want her [ __ ] badass I put it back in the cookie jar and I remember who the [ __ ] I really am I'm not the kid that guy that was calling me I'm not the scared kid this is who I am it's a reminder of who you truly are at the core of yourself but what I was saying to myself the whole time on that track in it and this is what I say to myself self talk and visualization of the two keys to my success I believed for that last time 19 miles I was indestructible because I took myself in that chair crapping up my back peeing blood in my leg shin splints stress fractures I used all that for motivation versus negativity I use it for motivation I said to myself who on this [ __ ] we'd still be going right now you are you are you got to be the hardest [ __ ] on the planet is it true I don't give a [ __ ] at that time it got me to the finish line of that [ __ ] race I believed it I believe it today I believed it enough to where my body said he's not gonna stop and that's I took all the negative things I need to go to the hospital this and that and I use you who they don't even think about taping stress fractures all those things I'd use for motivation so if you think that I'm some unhappy guy you're wrong having lived a life I've lived in seeing the other side not being afraid to attack what was in front of me has made me happy say that again in fact let me make sure I understood it getting to the point where you're not afraid to face the thing on the other side of the door that wants to attack you has made you happy right what the dark side is is we all have a cookie jar and we all have a jar of [ __ ] or [ __ ] just it's just ain't good night and in hell week what they do in hell week okay this is where I really went to the dark side what they're doing hell because they design how weak to find your flaws and they do a really good job of that it's 130 hours of continuous training you may get two hours of sleep and they beat the [ __ ] out of you and find everything wrong with your mentality and then they start helping and that's the beauty of it and for me I'm not some not no nasty guy giving guy you know I don't have a great bit of talent in anything so what got me through horrible times was the dark side whereas I created my name is David Goggin I created Goggins Goggins is the guy that can take anything you put in front of them you want to break my [ __ ] legs so be it I have a way of going to a place I could did in that race where all the pain and suffering that they put on top of me in hell week I will reverse that pain and suffering and I will take your soul so every instructor that put me through but it's my job what drove me was I wanted you to go home that night after you beat the living [ __ ] out of me and I smiled in your face I wanted you to feel worse than I did and you were going home to a nice warm bed with your wife or your kids and a nice meal and I was still out there in the grip suffering for another hundred Alex I want you to think about me knowing that I'm comfortable being very unfuckin comfortable and I want you to think about when you would do [ __ ] healthy how uncomfortable you were how bad you wanted to quit you knowing I'm not thinking that [ __ ] so the dark side is something that I've designed it's an evil place I can go that very few things can hurt I used to hurt you're trying to put on me I flip it upside down and use it you try use it for kryptonite and now it's power pillars for me I'm I'm your little strength I flip negative into positive targets people I said man you cuss all the [ __ ] time why well I hate to say it the best way for me to get how I feel across I can't see any say you know what I went through hell week and man it was it was really hard know that [ __ ] takes your damn soul rips it inside out and then they say now we're going to [ __ ] start it it allows me to express where I was at at a point of my life if I don't give you all of me why the hell am I here why how will you learn for me people take so much offense to me you will never learn from people if we always tap-dance around the truth by finding the right words I don't hurt you because you have thin skin no tighten up people it's okay trust me it's okay you might be called [ __ ] one day it's okay you might be cause some Jewish word or some [ __ ] or gay word it's okay let them call you that what are you going to do now they don't own your life how are you going to control that how are you going to flip it upside down and say Roger that now I'm going to harness this [ __ ] and you're read about me years from now how that's the question are you going to do thicken your skin become more believe it'll be afraid of the reflection in the mirror that's all you can be afraid of once you overcome the reflection in the mirror you've done it the younger generation quits not everybody so I got it I got put it people get to butthurt so not everybody most of this generation quits the second they get talk to you did this wrong you did this wrong or they get yelled at it so Lisa's number two be great nowadays because everybody else's most people are weak this this is a softer generation so if you have any mental toughness any of any ability give any fraction of self-discipline the ability to not want to do it but still do it people have a hard thing understand I hate to run and it makes me so crazy it doesn't need more people why did you run if you hate it what are you talking about I don't want to take showers and eat either I hate that too there's the whole that's a life man that innit it wasn't until I changed that mentality then I became somebody I hate it going to school so I guess what I was dumb as [ __ ] that's what will one plus one is two but if you can get through to doing things that you hate to do on the other side is greatness that's what people are saying by me running iein Calais in my mind I'm not training for a race I'm training for life I'm training for the time when I get that two o'clock in the morning call that my mom is dead or something happens tragic in life I don't fall apart I'm training my mind and my body my spirit so it's all one so I can handle what life is gonna throw at me because to life I've lived it throws a whole bunch at you and if you're not physically immensely prepared for that you're just gonna crumble and you're good for nobody when you are on one side of the door and your mind is racing because on the other side of that door it could be no one it could be four guys with four ak-47s that that door are you about to open can be trapped so once you open it boom your legs are gone so there's a thousand things you think about when you're the first guy second guy third guy get ready going to room and flooding you must be that person on that door Oh get ready to open it thinking to yourself if I die so be it the only way you can go in that door there's no there's a great chance that you're gonna die I hated jumping on airplanes I hated shooting guns I hated the job as a Navy SEAL but I did it because I wanted to change myself so my whole thing is if you're gonna choose to open that [ __ ] door in Iraq or Afghanistan open the [ __ ] go in hard because they're gonna remember you by slowly opening it and peeking in so if you're gonna open it and you made the mind open it don't crack it open open the [ __ ] door go in that's what like if your children do if you choose to do something attacking because they're gonna remember you that's not a tactic so I want to be remembered you can hate me but one thing you can't say about me I didn't attack it might work Avenue I choose I wouldn't be the very best and the very best may not be I'm number one the very bestest did I leave everything inside of me out there so attacking it's not like I want to win this or win that or be the best the best is I'm running against myself and everything I do and that's and that's what I attacked I attacked myself I'm always questioning myself I'm always holding myself accountable the accountability mirror is something that I kind of came up with in high school like I said I started shaving my head not 16 and I got caught up in trying to impress so many people because no one liked me so I developed so many different identities let me sag my pants you know let me okay let me pull my pants up let me let me talk this way we're actors whether it be this way or or whatever the hell it may be God God so many different things I did try to fit in with so many different groups that when you look in the mirror that's the one person you can't watch so every morning I would shave my head thank God I reflect back on some of the lies I may have told somebody or some of the ways I acted I ain't feel comfortable doing and I did it to impress other normal people the key word there is normal everyday people I was trying to make other people like me how pathetic is that so I did this mirror would always tell me my I got my reflection to say God you are a pathetic man how did I feel every day to be this way so I would just start having myself accountable ha how did I attack today how did I attack yesterday and if I didn't do something I was proud of I write down a sticky note and I would fix it so then my senior year in high school it was a totally different David God I you know I wanted to sit the cool guy wants to go man I know even though everyone's calling me a [ __ ] on time I wanted to try to act like somebody I wasn't so I could fit in and I sold my soul to the devil you know trying to act like no I'm David [ __ ] guy that's who I and so I wrote down on a piece of paper [ __ ] the table sit by your [ __ ] self and that's what I did and guess what happened my table became a table people started sitting in my movie I watched all timeless Rocky great choice rocky one and I related to Rocky a lot because of Kenny know what a smart guy just tried real hard and the one scene that I related a lot of my life to still in this day was Rocky one round 14 and this one I got taking souls front if you look at round 14 of rocky one Apollo is beating the [ __ ] out of running rocky falls down in this corner Mickey saying stay down stay down rocky didn't hear a [ __ ] soul Apollo active knocked it down turns around hands in the air like I finally knocked down this animal Apollo doesn't know it but Rocky is getting up a power turns around the second knocking yourself and a power lip set rocky and Apollo looks at him with the look of like rocky just took his soul he keep a Polish aches his head and rocky has his gloves and emotions towards Apollo come on [ __ ] I'm still here so the image in my mind of a man was not one that had earrings Shaggy's pants I had this image in my head and I was going to fulfill that and I didn't do any trends I stopped trending I stopped being this guy who whatever was new [ __ ] it that's not what I believe in I'm doing this this is what I want to be this what I'm gonna be when I was out I had time to reflect on all I've accomplished and that was the first time in my life where I sat back and said Wow because only I I may be telling you some of the story I know the exact truth of how brutal my life was and how I shouldn't be on this show today and how the mind and how beautiful it is so what brings me joy and happiness is knowing how beautiful the mind is and I'm one of the few people that didn't read about it didn't experience to do some some drug I got to experience the beauty of true [ __ ] willpower true [ __ ] you I'm gonna fail I'm gonna [ __ ] fail I'm gonna [ __ ] fail I'm gonna [ __ ] fail and I will succeed just me talking about that gives me a feeling I know what I did and I don't need to travel somewhere or they have this I have that I have it all here in my mind the beauty is remembering this young dumb but people called [ __ ] is now where I'm at today and that is when you finally get to that point for me it's forever lasting peace I'm doing it I could die right now on this show and I'll be happy man that's that's my happiness is my reflection on the suffering of my journey knowing I never quit nor was I got it by anybody on this earth I was guided by something much more powerful and I listened and I chose the path of most resistance talent not required I don't judge people out criticize you you will be a douchebag and being a stand that love this country you everyone do I don't care man I've fought for this country for you to do you and I and all about you doing you because I'm gonna [ __ ] do me and I'm gonna do me in time [ __ ] dead who are you at the core of your soul and if he can can't answer that question our conversations over I can't say [ __ ] to if you don't know who you are if you don't know who you are I can't tell you who you are hopefully I can help people that believe that they're much less than with a two-yard help them find greatness in themselves and greatness isn't running towards it miles at a time or doing 4,000 flips are being a seal greatness is whatever the hell you dreamed of in your own mind you got to first see it you got for us create this vision in your mind and then that's when I come into play once you create this vision in your mind it's how am I going to get there it's the the business created is inside of you so until you create that I'm nobody to you we all we are all great no matter if if you think you're dumb and maybe we think you're fat no matter if you are fat no Matt have you been bullied or no matter if you just got back from Iraq or Afghanistan and you have no legs or your arms or whatever man we all have greatness it just you got to find the courage you got to find the courage to put your Bose headphones on and silence the noise out of this world and to find it and the funding comes out there but it's going to take hard work courage self-discipline it's gonna take all the non-cognitive skills it's the non-cognitive skills that sets you apart from everybody else and and that's what it's all about [Music]
