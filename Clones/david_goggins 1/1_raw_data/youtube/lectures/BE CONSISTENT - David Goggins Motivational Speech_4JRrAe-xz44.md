## Transcrição

everything  I  had  gone  through  I  realized 
 that  the  human  mind  if  you  can  put  it  in 
 a  very  quiet  calm  place  and  get  it  to 
 calm  down  and  not  be  so  [ __ ]  that  you 
 could  possibly  make  this  work  out  for 
 you  how  bad  how  bad  are  you  really  so  I 
 calmed  myself  down  and  I  had  to  make 
 this  enormous  thing  small  I  had  30  more 
 miles  to  run  and  my  body  was  in  the 
 worst  shape  in  my  entire  life  the  worst 
 pain  I  ever  felt  in  my  life  so  I  broke 
 this  30  mil  thing  down  I  broke  it  down 
 to  small  chunks  I  Cal  my  mind  down  I  had 
 to  get  water  had  to  get  potassium  had  to 
 get  sodium  I  had  to  stop  being  so  dizzy 
 cuz  I  I  had  to  be  able  to  stand  up 
 so  my  disiness  went  away  after  about  an 
 hour  I  was  able  to  stand  up  now  and  I 
 was  going  around  this  track  at  like  30 
 some  minute  mile  and  I  never  get  my  crew 
 person  saying  hey  I  got  to  mile 
 81  it  said  you're  not  going  to  make  the 
 time  I  had  24  hours  and  I  was  going  so 
 slow  taking  so  much  time  this  is  when  I 
 realized  that  the  human  mind  once 
 everything  gets  connected  Once  the  mind 
 knows  you're  not  going  to  quit  something 
 it's  going  to  try  to  find  more  it's 
 going  to  try  to  give  you  more  once  it 
 realizes  you're  not  going  to  take  the 
 path  of  least  resistance  you're  going  to 
 stay  here  until  it's  done  my  mind  in  my 
 body  and  my  spirit  became  one  for  the 
 first  time  ever  for  the  first  time  ever 
 it  became  one  and  I  went  to  a  level  that 
 I  never  thought  was  humanly  possible  for 
 myself  or  anybody  else  in  that  shape 
 that  I  was  in  I  was  able  to  run  19  miles 
 and  I  ran  19  miles  did  100  miles 
 actually  did  one  more  mile  I  did  101 
 miles  in  18  hours  and  56  minutes  I'd 
 overcome  so  many  obstacles  in  my  life 
 and  this  was  the  fin  Crucible  for  me  and 
 I  got  through  it  and  at  the  end  of  this 
 race  was  such  Clarity  to  me  and  it  was 
 just  um  the  most  amazing  thing  I  ever  do 
 in  my  life  I  was  at  the  very  edge  of  my 
 capability  and  wasn't  sure  that  I  could 
 take  one  more  step  I  felt  like  I  drained 
 99%  from  my  tank  at  least  my  gas  light 
 was  on  my  engine  shuttering  yet  I  knew  I 
 had  to  find  more  if  I  was  going  to 
 finish  this  race  and  get  myself  into  bad 
 water  but  how  do  you  push  yourself  when 
 pain  is  all  you  feel  with  every  step 
 when  Agony  is  the  feedback  loop  that 
 permeates  each  cell  in  your  body  begging 
 you  to  stop  that's  tricky  because  the 
 threshold  for  suffering  is  different  for 
 everybody  what's  Universal  is  the 
 impulse  to  succumb  to  feel  like  you've 
 given  everything  you  can  and  that  you 
 are  justified  in  leaving  a  job 
 undone  by  now  I'm  sure  you  can  tell  that 
 it  doesn't  take  much  for  me  to  become 
 obsessed  some  criticize  ize  my  level  of 
 passion  but  I'm  not  down  with  the 
 prevailing  mentalities  that  tend  to 
 dominate  American  society  these  days  the 
 ones  that  tell  us  to  go  with  the  flow  or 
 invite  us  to  learn  how  to  get  more  with 
 less  effort  [ __ ]  that  shortcut  [ __ ] 
 the  reason  I  embrace  my  own  obsessions 
 and  demand  and  desire  more  of  myself  is 
 because  I've  learned  that  it's  only  when 
 I  push  Beyond  pain  and  suffering  past  my 
 perceived  limitations  that  I'm  capable 
 of  accomplishing  more  physically  and 
 mentally  in  endurance  races  but  also  in 
 life  as  a  whole  and  I  believe  the  same 
 is  true  for  you  the  human  body  is  like  a 
 stock  car  we  may  look  different  on  the 
 outside  but  under  the  hood  we  all  have 
 huge  reservoirs  of  potential  and  a 
 governor  impeding  us  from  reaching  our 
 maximum  velocity  in  a  car  the  governor 
 limits  the  flow  of  fuel  in  air  so  it 
 doesn't  burn  too  hot  which  places  a 
 ceiling  on  performance 
 it's  a  hardware  issue  the  governor  can 
 easily  be  removed  and  if  you  disable 
 yours  watch  your  car  rocket  Beyond  130 
 mph  it's  a  subtler  process  in  the  human 
 animal  our  governor  is  buried  deep  in 
 our  minds  interwined  with  our  very 
 identity  it  knows  what  and  who  we  love 
 and  hate  it's  read  our  whole  life  story 
 and  forms  the  way  we  see  ourselves  and 
 how  we'd  like  to  be  seen  it's  the 
 software  that  delivers  personalized 
 feedback  in  the  form  of  pain  and 
 exhaustion  but  also  fear  and  insecurity 
 and  it  uses  all  of  that  to  encourage  us 
 to  stop  before  we  risk  it  all  but  here's 
 the  thing  it  doesn't  have  absolute 
 control  unlike  the  governor  and  an 
 engine  ours  can't  stop  us  unless  we  buy 
 into  its  [ __ ]  and  agree  to  quit 
 sadly  most  of  us  give  up  when  we've  only 
 given  around  40%  of  our  maximum  effort 
 even  when  we  feel  like  we've  reached  our 
 absolute  limit  we  still  have  60  %  more 
 to  give  that's  the  governor  in  action 
 once  you  know  that  to  be  true  it's 
 simply  a  matter  of  stretching  your  pain 
 tolerance  letting  go  of  your  identity 
 and  all  your  self-limiting  stories  so 
 you  can  get  to 
 60%  then  80%  and  Beyond  without  giving 
 up  I  call  this  the  40%  Rule  and  the 
 reason  it's  so  powerful  is  that  if  you 
 follow  it  you  will  unlock  your  mind  to 
 new  levels  of  performance  and  Excellence 
 since  Sports  and  in  life  and  your 
 rewards  will  run  far  deeper  than  mere 
 material  success  the  40%  rule  can  be 
 applied  to  everything  we  do  because  in 
 life  almost  nothing  will  turn  out 
 exactly  as  we  hope  there  are  always 
 challenges  and  whether  we  are  at  work  or 
 school  or  feeling  tested  within  our  most 
 intimate  or  important  relationships  we 
 will  all  be  tempted  to  walk  away  from 
 commitments  give  up  on  our  goals  and 
 dreams  and  sell  our  own  happiness  short 
 at  some  point  because  we  will  feel  empty 
 like  we  have  no  more  to  give  when  we 
 haven't  tapped  even  half  of  the  TR 
 buried  deep  in  our  minds  hearts  and 
 souls  I  know  how  it  feels  to  be 
 approaching  an  energetic  dead  end  I've 
 been  there  too  many  times  to  count  I 
 understand  the  Temptation  is  so  short 
 but  I  also  know  that  impulse  is  driven 
 by  your  mind's  desire  for  comfort  and 
 it's  not  telling  you  the  truth  it's  your 
 identity  trying  to  find  Sanctuary  not 
 help  you  grow  it's  looking  for  status 
 quo  not  reaching  for  greatness  or 
 seeking  wholeness  but  the  software 
 update  that  you  need  to  shut  your 
 Governor  down  is  no  supersonic  download 
 it  takes  20  years  to  gain  20  years  of 
 experience  and  the  only  way  to  move 
 beyond  your  40%  is  to  callous  your  mind 
 day  after  day  which  means  you'll  have  to 
 chase  pain  like  it's  your  day  damn  job 
 imagine  you're  a  boxer  and  on  your  first 
 day  in  the  ring  you  take  one  on  your 
 chin  it's  going  to  hurt  like  [ __ ] 
 hell  but  a  year  T  of  being  a  boxer  you 
 won't  be  stopped  by  one  punch  you'll  be 
 able  to  absorb  12  rounds  of  getting  beat 
 the  down  and  come  back  the  very  next  day 
 and  fight  again  it's  not  that  the  punch 
 has  lost  power  your  opponents  will  be 
 even  stronger  the  change  has  happened 
 within  your  brain  you've  calloused  your 
 mind  over  a  period  of  time  your 
 tolerance  for  mental  and  physical 
 suffering  will  have  expanded  because 
 your  software  will  have  learned  that  you 
 can  take  a  hell  of  a  lot  more  than  one 
 punch  and  if  you  stay  with  any  task  that 
 is  trying  to  beat  you  down  you  will  reap 
 rewards  not  a  fire  say  you  like  to  run 
 but  have  a  broken  pinky  toe  I'll  bet  if 
 you  continue  running  on  it  pretty  soon 
 you'll  be  able  to  run  on  broken  legs 
 sounds  impossible  right  I  know  it's  true 
 because  because  I've  run  on  broken  legs 
 and  that  knowledge  helped  me  endure  all 
 manner  of  agonies  on  the  ultra  circuit 
 which  has  revealed  a  clear  spring  of 
 self-confidence  that  I  drink  from 
 whenever  my  tank  is  dry  but  nobody  Taps 
 their  Reserve  60%  right  away  or  all  at 
 once  the  first  step  is  to  remember  that 
 your  initial  blast  of  pain  and  fatigue 
 is  your  Governor  talking  once  you  do 
 that  you  are  in  control  of  the  dialogue 
 in  your  mind  and  you  can  remind  yourself 
 that  you  are  not  as  drained  as  you 
 think  that  you  haven't  given  it  your  all 
 not  even  close  buying  into  that  will 
 keep  you  in  the  fight  and  that's  worth 
 an  extra  5%  of  course  that's  easier 
 listen  than  done  it  wasn't  easy  to  begin 
 the  fourth  lap  of  the  hurt  100  because  I 
 knew  how  much  it  would  hurt  and  when  you 
 are  feeling  dead  and  buried  dehydrated 
 rung  out  and  torn  the  up  at  40%  finding 
 that  extra  60%  feels  impossible  I  didn't 
 want  my  suffering  to  continue  nobody 
 does  that's  why  the  line  fatigue  makes 
 cowards  of  us  all  is  true  as  mind  you  I 
 didn't  know  anything  about  the  40%  rule 
 that  day  the  hurt  100  is  when  I  first 
 started  to  contemplate  it  but  I  had  hit 
 the  wall  many  times  before  and  I  had 
 learned  to  stay  present  and  openminded 
 enough  to  recalibrate  my  goals  even  at 
 my  lowest  I  knew  that  staying  the  fight 
 is  always  the  hardest  and  most  rewarding 
 first  step  of  course  it's  easy  to  be 
 open-minded  when  you  leave  yoga  class 
 and  are  taking  a  stroll  by  the  beach  but 
 when  you're  suffering  keeping  an  open 
 mind  is  hard  work  the  same  is  true  if 
 you  are  facing  a  daunting  Challenge  on 
 the  job  or  at  school  maybe  you  are 
 tackling  a  100  question  test  and  know 
 that  you  brick  the  first  50  at  that 
 point  it's  extremely  difficult  to 
 maintain  the  necessary  discipline  to 
 force  yourself  to  keep  keep  taking  the 
 test  seriously  it's  also  imperative  that 
 you  find  it  because  in  every  failure 
 there  is  something  to  be  gained  even  if 
 it's  only  practiced  for  the  next  test 
 you'll  have  to  take  because  that  next 
 test  is  coming  that's  a  guarantee  the  1 
 second  decision  is  I  had  to  live  through 
 that  1  second  decision  several  times 
 during  this  race  so  this  race  took  me 
 aund  and  some  hours  okay  and  this  is 
 what  people  don't  get  for  you  to  finish 
 that  race  even  though  I  dnfed  I  still 
 finished  in  the  time  so  there's  a  lot  of 
 pride  in  that  so  what  I  do  in  that  one 
 second  because  we  all  think  about 
 quitting  hard  but  what  you  have  to  do  in 
 that  one  second  is  hard  to  process 
 information  during 
 pain  because  that  pain  takes  over  and 
 you  can't  think  rationally  you're 
 thinking  about  fight  ORF  flight  save 
 yourself  that's  not  a  rational  thought 
 it's  not  a  thought  that's  going  to  get 
 you 
 through  hard 
 times  most  people  fail  that  one  second 
 so  what  happens  what  I  do  in  that  one 
 second  it's  and  there's  a  bigger  process 
 to  all  this  but  in  that  one 
 second  I  physically  stayed  in  that 
 water  because  if  I  get  out  of  the  water 
 I  quit  so  I  physically  stay  in  the  water 
 but 
 mentally  I'm  on  the  beach  with  the 
 instructors  and  the  instructors  is  cold 
 outside  so  they  got  these  Parkers  on 
 they  got  their  cup  of  Joe  and  they're 
 warm  cuz  they've  already  been  through  it 
 so  now  it's  your  turn  to  go  through  it 
 so  m  i  get  back  with  them  I'm  still  in 
 the  water  physically  but  mentally  I'm 
 back  with  I'm  chilling  I  got  my  Parker 
 on  and  now  I'm  thinking  logically  cuz 
 I'm  warm  now  mentally  I'm  warm  I've 
 taken  that  one 
 second  let's  not  quit  yet  Goggins  let's 
 think  about  your  options  where  are  you 
 going  to  end  up  if  you  quit  this  where 
 you  going  to  go  what  are  you  going  to 
 say  to  yourself  because  you  know  you're 
 going  to  get  warm  the  second  you  get  out 
 this  water  you  could  take  a  shower  and 
 you  could  be  warm  and  you  could  be  and 
 in  5  days  you  could  be  out  so  I  start 
 thinking 
 logically  I  calm  my  brain  down  because 
 your  brain  just  wants  to  get  the  out 
 ring  the  bell  push  your  Hamet  down  get 
 warm  and  then  you're  really  and  these 
 are  the  things  you  have  to  think  about 
 the  one  second  decision  so  that's  what 
 that's  all  about  it's  about  gaining 
 control  of  your  mind  putting  things  back 
 in  the  proper 
 perspective  and  then  saying  I  do  want  to 
 be  here  and  I'm  going  to  have  a  bunch  of 
 these  1  seconds  through  this  130  hour 
 journey  and  I  have  to  learn  to  control 
 these  because  if  I  fail  one  of  these  one 
 seconds  I  will  not  be  a  seal  I  will  not 
 be  a  doctor  I  will  not  be  a  lawyer  I 
 will  not  be  whatever  the  it  is  so  that's 
 how  important  that  one  second  decision 
 is  it's  all  about  your  mind  takes 
 control  of  you  you  have  to  say  you  I  run 
 this  and  that's  what  that's  all  about  we 
 must  create  a  system  that  that 
 constantly  reminds  us  who  the  we  are 
 when  we  are  at  our  best  because  life  is 
 not  going  to  pick  us  up  when  we  fall 
 there  will  be  Forks  in  the  road  knives 
 in  youring  back  mountains  to  climb  and 
 we  are  only  capable  of  living  up  to  the 
 image  we  create  for 
 ourselves  prepare 
 yourself  we  know  life  can  be  hard  and 
 yet  we  feel  sorry  for  ourselves  when  it 
 isn't  fair  from  this  point  forward 
 accept  the  following  as  goggin's  laws  of 
 nature  you  will  be  made  fun  of  you  will 
 feel  insecure  you  may  not  be  the  best 
 all  the  time  you  may  be  the  only  black 
 white  asian  latino  female  male  gay 
 lesbian  there  will  be  times  when  you 
 feel  alone  get  over  it  our  minds  are 
 fing  strong  they  are  our  most  powerful 
 weapon  but  we  have  stopped  using  them  we 
 have  access  to  so  many  more  resources 
 today  than  ever  before  and  yet  we  are  so 
 much  less  capable  than  those  who  came 
 before  us  if  you  want  to  be  one  of  the 
 few  to  defy  those  Trends  in  our  ever 
 softening  Society  you  will  have  to  be 
 willing  to  go  to  war  with  yourself  and 
 create  a  whole  new  identity  which 
 requires  an  open  mind  it's  funny  being 
 openminded  is  often  tagged  as  new  age  or 
 soft  that  being  open-minded  enough  to 
 find  a  way 
 is  old  school  it's  what  knuckle  draggers 
 do  and  that's  exactly  what  I  did  failure 
 is  just  a  word  for  me  failure  was  me 
 having  more  information  on  how  to 
 succeed  that's  all  failure  became  to  me 
 so  I  failed  so  much  pull-up  records 
 running  events  had  to  quit  this  buds 
 Rangers  all  this  crap  I  had  to  go  back 
 through  all  that  was  was  oh  I  failed 
 because  of  these  reasons  here  go  back  to 
 the  drawing  board  figure  out  the  right 
 equation  put  it  together  go  back  fail 
 again  oh  but  I  got  more  information  so 
 everything  I  was  afraid  of  I  made  sure 
 to  meet  it  right  in  the  face  and 
 overcome
