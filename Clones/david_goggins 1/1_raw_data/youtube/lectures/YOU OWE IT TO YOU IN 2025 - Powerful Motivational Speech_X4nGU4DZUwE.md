[00:27] weakness and it will just Hammer you
[00:32] so it's time to get back to work get
[00:34] back to
[00:35] work stop hearing yourself talk get off
[00:38] the podcast don't be on social media too
[00:40] much cut out all the [ __ ] noise get
[00:43] back to theing mental lab cuz that's
[00:45] where the knowledge came
[00:47] from you need to get to a point in your
[00:49] life where there's nothing can hurt you
[00:51] because you know exactly who you are
[00:53] you've faced your demons you were able
[00:56] to hear all your past traumas you were
[00:59] able to listen to them
[01:00] you're able to say okay now I can now
[01:03] talk to people about what I went through
[01:05] I'm no longer embarrassed I'm no longer
[01:07] ashamed being ashamed is one of the
[01:09] biggest things that kill people nowadays
[01:11] in their minds kill them from moving
[01:12] forward I'm ashamed of myself don't ever
[01:15] be ashamed of anything you've done in
[01:16] your life face it fix it make it
[01:19] better everything I need is in my mental
[01:22] lab everything CU I'm in constant study
[01:26] of myself and I know what needs to be
[01:29] conquered because I'm constantly going
[01:31] through what I don't like what I'm not
[01:34] comfortable with I know and only I can
[01:38] fix these problems cuz I have to face
[01:41] these
[01:43] problems unchosen suffering is going to
[01:45] happen right so the only thing that you
[01:47] can do is have some chosen suffering to
[01:49] prepare for it it's the only thing you
[01:51] can do that's the only thing you can
[01:53] practice for the unchosen suffering is
[01:54] have chosen suffering do something that
[01:57] sucks every day
[02:00] I'm not trying to send a message of run
[02:03] 200 miles be the bad [ __ ] in the
[02:05] world but be
[02:07] tough you better have a part about you
[02:10] that's tough a part about you that can
[02:12] break down situations and get better and
[02:15] break down situations very quickly
[02:18] within some trauma in your life some
[02:21] Devastation in your life cuz it's going
[02:22] to come the devastation the trauma is
[02:24] going to come and you can't allow that
[02:26] to become a jersey barrier it can't be
[02:30] Jersey Barry has to be something that
[02:31] you can maneuver through very quickly
[02:33] and move forward that takes a lot of
[02:36] toughness a lot of people when you die
[02:40] they figure out why you died they figure
[02:42] out how you died in the
[02:45] autopsy but we never do live autopsy to
[02:47] figure out why we're dying while we are
[02:50] alive and I was dying I was living every
[02:53] day but I was really dead and so I
[02:56] figured it out and once I figured it out
[02:58] I was able to
[03:00] reborn I was able to be
[03:03] reborn you must take this knowledge that
[03:05] you learn from all this [ __ ] is
[03:07] knowledge so I'm just trying to give
[03:09] people that strength to go in the
[03:11] archives of your life cuz while you're
[03:14] probably up it's probably something
[03:16] happened to you in your life go through
[03:17] the archives dig it up study it and then
[03:22] use it for yourself that's that's the
[03:24] main purpose for me right now you need
[03:26] to be better here you need be better
[03:27] here you need to overcome this overcome
[03:29] that and I you know people need to have
[03:31] purpose to get up they need purpose to
[03:33] perform you need to get to a point in
[03:36] your life where there's nothing on the
[03:38] docket there's no 5K there's no I'm
[03:42] going to get into school to be this or
[03:43] that and still perform to the highest
[03:46] level cuz what people don't get is one
[03:49] day that thing is going to come up and
[03:52] if you're not constantly performing
[03:54] without purpose you're not going to be
[03:56] ready when the time comes it's this
[03:58] magical thing that we're all looking for
[04:01] but what's funny about it all is that we
[04:03] need these things to perform but we
[04:06] don't take a second to realize the
[04:08] purpose is always there the purpose
[04:11] never leaves us cuz the very purpose is
[04:14] you you are always the purpose there may
[04:18] be another purpose like being a seal or
[04:21] going to college or whatever but the
[04:23] main purpose in life is you so if you
[04:25] wake up in the morning and you don't
[04:27] want to do something you don't care
[04:29] enough about yourself and that's what
[04:32] you need to really research is why am I
[04:35] not doing this for myself because that
[04:37] is the number one purpose in life is to
[04:40] better oneself so that's the only
[04:42] purpose I fuing need so the reason I get
[04:45] up every day even though there's no race
[04:47] or there's no school there's nothing in
[04:48] front of me is because I have pride in
[04:53] myself I was born David gogins David
[04:55] gogins wasn't good enough he was a
[04:58] scared bullied
[05:00] uh abused kid um who struggled in life
[05:04] and that kid whenever something got
[05:06] tough you matter how hard I trained no
[05:09] matter how ready I was whenever
[05:11] something got tough for me David goggin
[05:15] the real David goggin would come out and
[05:17] he would quit so I realized this over a
[05:20] period of time so I had to build
[05:23] goggin and in that process that's where
[05:27] I get better
[05:29] [Music]
[05:33] I get better when I'm digging holes in
[05:37] the ground when I'm waking up early
[05:39] knowing I don't have to do these things
[05:41] that's where I get better so it's
[05:42] important to stay hungry it's important
[05:44] to stay hungry but it's important more
[05:47] to stay humble within that hunger so
[05:50] while you're hungry a lot of people are
[05:52] hungry but humility is everything what
[05:55] was that story about William Crawford
[05:58] the janitor yeah so this guy won the
[06:00] Medal of Honor so he won the Medal of
[06:03] Honor and which is the highest award in
[06:05] the
[06:06] military and this guy went to the Air
[06:11] Force Academy and he was a
[06:14] janitor and no one knew who the this man
[06:17] was he had the highest award in all the
[06:20] military for heroics for heroics saving
[06:24] lives putting his life on the line you
[06:26] know could have been killed and he is
[06:28] now basically you know cleaning shs for
[06:33] young kids and we can all imagine how
[06:36] that probably went you know there's
[06:38] probably some you know little bit of
[06:40] taunting here and there and he just sat
[06:42] there and cleaned the so that's why he's
[06:44] in my trained humility part because for
[06:47] this man to be at the level he was and
[06:49] had that kind of humility to go I'm a
[06:52] middle of Honor winner but I'm going to
[06:53] put that in my closet and I'm going to
[06:55] pick up my broom and dust pan and I'm
[06:57] going to pick up you know this Rag and
[06:59] clean the for these young men that right
[07:02] there is amazing for me man that's
[07:04] that's where you grow that's that's
[07:05] growth huge growth and also it shows
[07:08] that he was doing his
[07:09] job he was a
[07:11] servant he didn't look at himself any
[07:13] better than anybody else the second you
[07:16] do that you totally lost you cannot look
[07:18] at yourself like people with me even I
[07:22] always look at people I I know where you
[07:24] are I know where cuz I've been there
[07:27] that's why I help so many people out
[07:29] I've I've never been above you I've
[07:32] always pretty much been beneath you and
[07:34] that's where my knowledge came from so I
[07:35] know how to reach those people who are
[07:37] in the dungeon because I've been there
[07:40] so many
[07:41] times you have to be your best self and
[07:44] your least
[07:45] motivated and that's the tricky part
[07:47] about all that motivation is just a word
[07:51] you have to have these different things
[07:52] in your mind on where you want to go and
[07:54] know that motivation is not going to get
[07:56] me there cuz I'm not going to always be
[07:58] motivated Joo said the exact same thing
[08:01] he said that discipline needs motivation
[08:02] for breakfast and discipline is good too
[08:06] but without a clear head space there's
[08:08] no discipline what you mean so let's say
[08:12] we have a circuit breaker okay and I'm
[08:15] loading everything up to one circuit
[08:17] just load it up it's going toing
[08:21] blow and once that thing blows man the
[08:24] circuit areed
[08:25] up you got to have each thing plugged
[08:29] into to the right spot like a crowded
[08:32] garage you can't put anything in it once
[08:35] your brain is crowded discipline is
[08:38] great motivation is great but if you
[08:41] can't fit in your brain because it's
[08:43] alling cluttered with
[08:45] [ __ ] there's no
[08:47] discipline you may have it sometimes
[08:50] when it fits in that crowded garage of
[08:52] your mind but you don't have the
[08:54] consistency that you need to have with
[08:56] that discipline I call it mental zones
[08:59] is you're organized in your mind so you
[09:02] can put that discipline so a lot of
[09:04] people talk about discipline okay great
[09:06] why do you fall off the wagon why can't
[09:09] I continue with this routine going to
[09:13] the gym being better waking up early
[09:15] eating the right Foods it's because
[09:18] maybe it's your kids maybe it's your
[09:19] wife maybe it's your job and it's all
[09:22] just stuffed in your fcking brain you
[09:24] don't have it compartmentalized and
[09:26] organized in these nice shelves a lot of
[09:29] people whose brain Hey where's my d h
[09:31] let me look they're throwing they're
[09:33] looking through totes they're all up so
[09:36] where am I going to put discipline in
[09:38] that mind if I can't find other you got
[09:41] to be able to find all these different
[09:43] things in your mind oh I can put
[09:45] discipline right there if your life is
[09:48] not organized and your life being
[09:52] everything around you because it takes
[09:54] one little the piece of outside
[09:58] interference to clutter your whole mind
[10:02] your mind has to always be clear that's
[10:05] why I meditate 2 hours every single
[10:08] night because I refresh I reorganize the
[10:12] garage which is my mind every night so
[10:15] then discipline's in there organization
[10:18] everything is in this right spot I'm
[10:20] waking up and I'm giving myself all this
[10:23] armor so when I come out in the world
[10:25] I'm ready I'm not waking up late I'm not
[10:28] rushing around I'm not disorganized so
[10:31] when I wake up I'm ready to
[10:34] go why is the truth so
[10:38] important you have to have the truth to
[10:41] have a starting point and your true self
[10:44] is found in that very uncomfortable
[10:48] Zone we all look for
[10:51] toughness we all want
[10:54] it but we look for it in a comfortable
[10:57] environment you will not find toughness
[11:01] in a comfortable
[11:03] environment those of you who are
[11:05] listening to this you will not find it
[11:08] the only way you find it is to drown
[11:11] yourself in a position where you're just
[11:13] out of sorts where you can't swim and
[11:16] you're drowning you're
[11:19] drowning will you say know what ma'am
[11:22] [ __ ]
[11:25] that once you come face to face with who
[11:28] you are you have a starting
[11:30] [Music]
[11:31] point it's in our head saying you know
[11:34] what man dude you're not you're not
[11:37] doing [ __ ] you're wasting a bunch of
[11:40] percentage here in this other 80% is
[11:43] suffering pain failure failure failure
[11:49] self-doubt
[11:51] darkness and then a whole bunch of
[11:54] light but to get to this light you got
[11:57] to go through all of this [ __ ]
[12:00] you're not succeeding and you're not
[12:02] achieving it's because you're afraid to
[12:04] go in that dark place to find
[12:06] yourself you're setting goals you know
[12:10] you can reach and when you do that that
[12:14] fear that insecurity that doubt that's
[12:18] where you grow you must always set goals
[12:22] that you think you cannot achieve and in
[12:24] there you get better when that long
[12:27] clock goes off at 4:00 or 5 in the
[12:29] morning your mind says no you just say
[12:32] this is what we do it's what we do now
[12:35] because to get to where you want to go
[12:37] the amount of pain involved the amount
[12:39] of mental pain of how many times you're
[12:42] going to have to do something that you
[12:44] don't want to do to get to where you
[12:46] want to
[12:48] go every day you must ask yourself did I
[12:52] do
[12:53] enough and then once you do this over
[12:56] and over and over again it becomes like
[12:59] breathing I don't want to live this
[13:01] lifestyle but to get to the other side
[13:03] of this I have to so if you really want
[13:06] it you realize what trying is and what
[13:09] trying is
[13:17] not your brain is the most powerful
[13:20] weapon in the
[13:25] world once you put away your phones and
[13:28] your computers and and all that [ __ ] we
[13:29] have
[13:31] nowadays your brain is the only thing
[13:35] you have when you're going through
[13:37] depression when you when you're going
[13:39] through hard times you're going through
[13:41] death real life [ __ ] you can't Google
[13:44] that [ __ ]
[13:46] man you're alone you're alone you may
[13:49] have a shrink you're going to you may
[13:51] have a best friend you're going to but
[13:53] there's 24 hours in the day where you're
[13:56] alone in this brain and your brain is
[13:58] talking to you in all kind of ways and
[14:00] it wants to control you and pull you in
[14:02] these different Pockets if you can't
[14:04] control your own brain and your brain
[14:07] controls you you're [ __ ] you got to
[14:09] tell your brain where you want to go and
[14:11] how you want to go and how you want to
[14:12] get there you got to control it if not
[14:15] it's over it's
[14:18] over all I knew back then was hard work
[14:23] you got to work hard you got to work
[14:25] hard I can't get this paragraph I can't
[14:27] remember what the [ __ ] in this
[14:28] paragraph to pass this test to get in
[14:30] the military read again still not
[14:33] getting it read again but if you're not
[14:35] getting it write it out and that's how I
[14:37] started
[14:39] learning I realized if I keep going back
[14:42] and going back and going back until the
[14:45] [ __ ] just becomes your mind will say
[14:48] [ __ ] okay we're going to figure it out
[14:51] it'll find a way because he is not going
[14:53] to
[14:54] stop it's not like I'm going to try one
[14:56] more time no R clock goes off woo we're
[15:00] going back I can't read right we're
[15:02] going back I gave myself no way out and
[15:06] my mind realized that they said okay
[15:08] we're going to adapt and overcome now
[15:11] that was my mindset and that's how you
[15:13] get through things you put yourself you
[15:16] immerse yourself in wherever it is and
[15:18] you become
[15:20] that I became
[15:23] hell and that became my new Norm I gave
[15:26] myself no way out there was nothing
[15:28] outside these walls walls of Hell
[15:37] nothing I watched this segment on TV
[15:40] about these guys going through Navy
[15:41] still training and I couldn't even I I
[15:44] was a great swimmer I was afraid of the
[15:45] water all this crap
[15:48] man I saw these guys just quitting but
[15:51] at the very end it says 22 guys there
[15:54] command officers up there and he gives
[15:55] this great
[15:57] speech so I started visualizing me being
[16:00] the 23rd guy sitting there with these
[16:03] guys I said man if I could feel that
[16:06] that would change my
[16:07] life and what was that feeling you
[16:09] wanted so bad respect accomplishment
[16:12] Victory I wanted to win not like beat
[16:15] somebody else it wasn't about that I I I
[16:19] just wanted to go the distance
[16:21] everything in my life when something got
[16:23] hard I
[16:25] quit I had didn't work harder than you
[16:27] so I quit
[16:30] like man if I could just go that
[16:32] distance that extra mile to just go just
[16:36] to finish I want to finish I want to
[16:39] feel Victory and victory for me wasn't
[16:41] winning it was just finishing so I said
[16:44] you know what if I could feel like these
[16:47] guys feel it would change my
[16:51] life and literally I started feeling
[16:54] Victory just by putting myself in the
[16:57] battle
[17:00] I started realizing man just by going to
[17:03] war with myself every day and putting
[17:07] these challenges and these goals and
[17:08] these obstacles these insurmountable
[17:11] obstacles now we can move from
[17:15] there but if you look at it as man I'm
[17:17] broken and I'm still here and I'm
[17:20] fighting and I'm going to find a way to
[17:21] get through this cuz I have no other
[17:24] place to go it gives you a lot of power
[17:30] and no one really finds thems without
[17:33] going through trials tribulations
[17:36] suffering accountability and
[17:39] accountability is suffering being
[17:43] accountable everying day for doing right
[17:46] for yourself for the people next to you
[17:48] it's
[17:50] measurable the more I do this the more I
[17:52] gain confidence and then the more I gain
[17:55] confidence the more I realize [ __ ] these
[17:57] Navy Seals man
[18:01] man the the these guys can't do what I'm
[18:03] doing right now I had no coach had no
[18:06] trainer had no money I didn't know how
[18:08] to lose weight I had no knowledge of
[18:11] what I was doing I was just working I
[18:13] was just
[18:16] sacrificing but I would have never found
[18:18] these
[18:19] tools if I didn't put myself in a very
[18:23] uncomfortable place and your true self
[18:25] is found in that very uncomfortable Zone
[18:29] that's where he came from he came from
[18:31] all these [ __ ] up obstacles and now
[18:34] he's
[18:35] there so everybody goes how do you do
[18:38] that you know exactly how to do that

of anything you've done in your life face it fix it make it better everything I need is in my mental lab everything CU I'm in constant study of myself and I know what needs to be conquered because I'm constantly going through what I don't like what I'm not comfortable with I know and only I can fix these problems cuz I have to face these problems unchosen suffering is going to happen right so the only thing that you can do is have some chosen suffering to prepare for it it's the only thing you can do that's the only thing you can practice for the unchosen suffering is have chosen suffering do something that sucks every day I'm not trying to send a message of run 200 miles be the bad [ __ ] in the world but be tough you better have a part about you that's tough a part about you that can break down situations and get better and break down situations very quickly within some trauma in your life some Devastation in your life cuz it's going to come the devastation the trauma is going to come and you can't allow that to become a jersey barrier it can't be Jersey Barry has to be something that you can maneuver through very quickly and move forward that takes a lot of toughness a lot of people when you die they figure out why you died they figure out how you died in the autopsy but we never do live autopsy to figure out why we're dying while we are alive and I was dying I was living every day but I was really dead and so I figured it out and once I figured it out I was able to reborn I was able to be reborn you must take this knowledge that you learn from all this [ __ ] is knowledge so I'm just trying to give people that strength to go in the archives of your life cuz while you're probably up it's probably something happened to you in your life go through the archives dig it up study it and then use it for yourself that's that's the main purpose for me right now you need to be better here you need be better here you need to overcome this overcome that and I you know people need to have purpose to get up they need purpose to perform you need to get to a point in your life where there's nothing on the docket there's no 5K there's no I'm going to get into school to be this or that and still perform to the highest level cuz what people don't get is one day that thing is going to come up and if you're not constantly performing without purpose you're not going to be ready when the time comes it's this magical thing that we're all looking for but what's funny about it all is that we need these things to perform but we don't take a second to realize the purpose is always there the purpose never leaves us cuz the very purpose is you you are always the purpose there may be another purpose like being a seal or going to college or whatever but the main purpose in life is you so if you wake up in the morning and you don't want to do something you don't care enough about yourself and that's what you need to really research is why am I not doing this for myself because that is the number one purpose in life is to better oneself so that's the only purpose I fuing need so the reason I get up every day even though there's no race or there's no school there's nothing in front of me is because I have pride in myself I was born David gogins David gogins wasn't good enough he was a scared bullied uh abused kid um who struggled in life and that kid whenever something got tough you matter how hard I trained no matter how ready I was whenever something got tough for me David goggin the real David goggin would come out and he would quit so I realized this over a period of time so I had to build goggin and in that process that's where I get better [Music] I get better when I'm digging holes in the ground when I'm waking up early knowing I don't have to do these things that's where I get better so it's important to stay hungry it's important to stay hungry but it's important more to stay humble within that hunger so while you're hungry a lot of people are hungry but humility is everything what was that story about William Crawford the janitor yeah so this guy won the Medal of Honor so he won the Medal of Honor and which is the highest award in the military and this guy went to the Air Force Academy and he was a janitor and no one knew who the this man was he had the highest award in all the military for heroics for heroics saving lives putting his life on the line you know could have been killed and he is now basically you know cleaning shs for young kids and we can all imagine how that probably went you know there's probably some you know little bit of taunting here and there and he just sat there and cleaned the so that's why he's in my trained humility part because for this man to be at the level he was and had that kind of humility to go I'm a middle of Honor winner but I'm going to put that in my closet and I'm going to pick up my broom and dust pan and I'm going to pick up you know this Rag and clean the for these young men that right there is amazing for me man that's that's where you grow that's that's growth huge growth and also it shows that he was doing his job he was a servant he didn't look at himself any better than anybody else the second you do that you totally lost you cannot look at yourself like people with me even I always look at people I I know where you are I know where cuz I've been there that's why I help so many people out I've I've never been above you I've always pretty much been beneath you and that's where my knowledge came from so I know how to reach those people who are in the dungeon because I've been there so many times you have to be your best self and your least motivated and that's the tricky part about all that motivation is just a word you have to have these different things in your mind on where you want to go and know that motivation is not going to get me there cuz I'm not going to always be motivated Joo said the exact same thing he said that discipline needs motivation for breakfast and discipline is good too but without a clear head space there's no discipline what you mean so let's say we have a circuit breaker okay and I'm loading everything up to one circuit just load it up it's going toing blow and once that thing blows man the circuit areed up you got to have each thing plugged into to the right spot like a crowded garage you can't put anything in it once your brain is crowded discipline is great motivation is great but if you can't fit in your brain because it's alling cluttered with [ __ ] there's no discipline you may have it sometimes when it fits in that crowded garage of your mind but you don't have the consistency that you need to have with that discipline I call it mental zones is you're organized in your mind so you can put that discipline so a lot of people talk about discipline okay great why do you fall off the wagon why can't I continue with this routine going to the gym being better waking up early eating the right Foods it's because maybe it's your kids maybe it's your wife maybe it's your job and it's all just stuffed in your fcking brain you don't have it compartmentalized and organized in these nice shelves a lot of people whose brain Hey where's my d h let me look they're throwing they're looking through totes they're all up so where am I going to put discipline in that mind if I can't find other you got to be able to find all these different things in your mind oh I can put discipline right there if your life is not organized and your life being everything around you because it takes one little the piece of outside interference to clutter your whole mind your mind has to always be clear that's why I meditate 2 hours every single night because I refresh I reorganize the garage which is my mind every night so then discipline's in there organization everything is in this right spot I'm waking up and I'm giving myself all this armor so when I come out in the world I'm ready I'm not waking up late I'm not rushing around I'm not disorganized so when I wake up I'm ready to go why is the truth so important you have to have the truth to have a starting point and your true self is found in that very uncomfortable Zone we all look for toughness we all want it but we look for it in a comfortable environment you will not find toughness in a comfortable environment those of you who are listening to this you will not find it the only way you find it is to drown yourself in a position where you're just out of sorts where you can't swim and you're drowning you're drowning will you say know what ma'am [ __ ] that once you come face to face with who you are you have a starting [Music] point it's in our head saying you know what man dude you're not you're not doing [ __ ] you're wasting a bunch of percentage here in this other 80% is suffering pain failure failure failure self-doubt darkness and then a whole bunch of light but to get to this light you got to go through all of this [ __ ] you're not succeeding and you're not achieving it's because you're afraid to go in that dark place to find yourself you're setting goals you know you can reach and when you do that that fear that insecurity that doubt that's where you grow you must always set goals that you think you cannot achieve and in there you get better when that long clock goes off at 4:00 or 5 in the morning your mind says no you just say this is what we do it's what we do now because to get to where you want to go the amount of pain involved the amount of mental pain of how many times you're going to have to do something that you don't want to do to get to where you want to go every day you must ask yourself did I do enough and then once you do this over and over and over again it becomes like breathing I don't want to live this lifestyle but to get to the other side of this I have to so if you really want it you realize what trying is and what trying is not your brain is the most powerful weapon in the world once you put away your phones and your computers and and all that [ __ ] we have nowadays your brain is the only thing you have when you're going through depression when you when you're going through hard times you're going through death real life [ __ ] you can't Google that [ __ ] man you're alone you're alone you may have a shrink you're going to you may have a best friend you're going to but there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone in this brain and your brain is talking to you in all kind of ways and it wants to control you and pull you in these different Pockets if you can't control your own brain and your brain controls you you're [ __ ] you got to tell your brain where you want to go and how you want to go and how you want to get there you got to control it if not it's over it's over all I knew back then was hard work you got to work hard you got to work hard I can't get this paragraph I can't remember what the [ __ ] in this paragraph to pass this test to get in the military read again still not getting it read again but if you're not getting it write it out and that's how I started learning I realized if I keep going back and going back and going back until the [ __ ] just becomes your mind will say [ __ ] okay we're going to figure it out it'll find a way because he is not going to stop it's not like I'm going to try one more time no R clock goes off woo we're going back I can't read right we're going back I gave myself no way out and my mind realized that they said okay we're going to adapt and overcome now that was my mindset and that's how you get through things you put yourself you immerse yourself in wherever it is and you become that I became hell and that became my new Norm I gave myself no way out there was nothing outside these walls walls of Hell nothing I watched this segment on TV about these guys going through Navy still training and I couldn't even I I was a great swimmer I was afraid of the water all this crap man I saw these guys just quitting but at the very end it says 22 guys there command officers up there and he gives this great speech so I started visualizing me being the 23rd guy sitting there with these guys I said man if I could feel that that would change my life and what was that feeling you wanted so bad respect accomplishment Victory I wanted to win not like beat somebody else it wasn't about that I I I just wanted to go the distance everything in my life when something got hard I quit I had didn't work harder than you so I quit like man if I could just go that distance that extra mile to just go just to finish I want to finish I want to feel Victory and victory for me wasn't winning it was just finishing so I said you know what if I could feel like these guys feel it would change my life and literally I started feeling Victory just by putting myself in the battle I started realizing man just by going to war with myself every day and putting these challenges and these goals and these obstacles these insurmountable obstacles now we can move from there but if you look at it as man I'm broken and I'm still here and I'm fighting and I'm going to find a way to get through this cuz I have no other place to go it gives you a lot of power and no one really finds thems without going through trials tribulations suffering accountability and accountability is suffering being accountable everying day for doing right for yourself for the people next to you it's measurable the more I do this the more I gain confidence and then the more I gain confidence the more I realize [ __ ] these Navy Seals man man the the these guys can't do what I'm doing right now I had no coach had no trainer had no money I didn't know how to lose weight I had no knowledge of what I was doing I was just working I was just sacrificing but I would have never found these tools if I didn't put myself in a very uncomfortable place and your true self is found in that very uncomfortable Zone that's where he came from he came from all these [ __ ] up obstacles and now he's there so everybody goes how do you do that you know exactly how to do that [Music]
