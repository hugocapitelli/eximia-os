[00:02] do when things get tough haha this is a
[00:06] good fuckin question manikin is going to
[00:08] get fucking difficult day after day
[00:10] after day that's the thing about what
[00:12] you're doing right now that's that's
[00:13] challenging is a lot of the
[00:15] motherfuckers can sign up for the
[00:17] fucking one-day event why don't we do a
[00:20] lot of these CEOs a lot of these people
[00:22] don't want to suffer you know as a
[00:25] living who don't want to suffer as
[00:27] making it a habit what they do is they
[00:29] go out and they recruit these people to
[00:33] put them through a two day three day
[00:35] fucking challenge anybody can do that
[00:38] shit because your mind can process two
[00:41] or three fucking days of suck what
[00:43] you're doing my friend is going to be
[00:46] damn near a month of suck so basically
[00:50] you're gonna have a lot of days
[00:51] especially in the morning time the
[00:54] mornings when you wake up and your body
[00:56] says go fuck yourself because I don't
[00:58] fucking like doing this today and you're
[01:00] gonna look at cuz you're running six
[01:02] miles a day I believe what you know
[01:04] what's going to happen to your fucking
[01:06] ass you're gonna wake up in the morning
[01:07] and you're gonna fucking do what I do
[01:09] people think all David goggies just
[01:11] wakes the fuck up and he just gets just
[01:13] shit on he gets this fuck am I gonna I
[01:16] don't get up and get after it I look at
[01:19] my shoes sometimes for hours I pass them
[01:24] I go I get stuff to drink I go to the
[01:27] bathroom I watch TV I'll start doing
[01:31] some work and I look at those fucking
[01:33] shoes because why my body's saying go
[01:35] fuck yourself so you have to be able to
[01:39] win the morning you have to be able to
[01:42] not allow that to get too deep in your
[01:44] brain and when things get really tough
[01:47] for you when you're out there on like
[01:49] day 17 and your knees are hurting and
[01:53] your back is hurt and your shoulders are
[01:55] hurting your elbow get elbow tendonitis
[01:57] and all kind of shit going on you got to
[02:00] start remembering your resume a lot of
[02:03] people don't remember what the fuck
[02:06] they've accomplished in life and at that
[02:10] time of suffering you have to be able to
[02:12] fucking go
[02:13] through and pull up that fucking who the
[02:17] fuck I am resume and say Oh for you you
[02:22] I'm sure you studied your fucking ass
[02:24] off for hours and days and years to give
[02:27] her your ass I guarantee you did shit
[02:30] harder than this
[02:31] and that's basically what you have to go
[02:34] back to but it's hard to do because in
[02:36] that moment of suffering all you can
[02:40] fucking think about is getting the fuck
[02:41] out of it so you got take that one
[02:44] second to pull yourself out of that
[02:46] suffering to have a clear fucking
[02:48] thought it's hard to have clear thoughts
[02:50] in the midst of extreme pain and
[02:54] suffering find that clear thought remind
[02:58] yourself of what you've been through
[03:01] back in the past back in the day to get
[03:04] to where you're at today so that's what
[03:05] I do it's a constant reminder and then
[03:08] through that process I guarantee you
[03:11] your mind and body muster up we got this
[03:14] we we've been here before maybe not that
[03:17] kind of pain and suffering but we've
[03:20] been here before in the demons of your
[03:22] own mind so that's the best reminder in
[03:25] the world
[03:33] you
