## Transcrição

I'm  trying  to  build  people  up  I'm  trying 
 to  armor  their  mind  I'm  trying  to  get 
 them  the  belief  because  this  world  we 
 live  in  is  tough  it  will  beat  you  down 
 the  world  and  the  life  that  we  live  in 
 is  the  ultimate  competitor  it  will  try 
 to  take  you  out  it  will  find  your 
 weakness  and  it  will  just  Hammer  you  if 
 I  can  help  you  build  belief  build 
 confidence  to  the  point  where  nothing 
 can  hurt  you  because  you  know  exactly 
 who  you 
 are  David  Goggins  welcome  to  the  show 
 hey  man  I  appreciate  you  having  me 
 brother  thank  you  thank  you  for  being 
 here  where  have  you  been  for  the  last 
 four  years  you've  been  jumping  out  of 
 helicopters  and  fighting  fires  and  what 
 have  you  been  doing  well  I  did  that  last 
 year  right  I  guess  this  year  I  did  that 
 but  I  just  I  just  do  me  you  know  I'm  out 
 there  running  working  out  and  uh  just 
 trying  to  find  out  more  of  what  this  is 
 all  about  trying  to  find  out  more  of 
 what  I'm  all  about  so  that  takes  me 
 getting  away  you  know  I'm  not  about  even 
 doing  these  podcasts  man  so  not  nothing 
 against  you  but  I'm  I'm  not  about  all 
 this  stuff  I'm  not  one  that  likes  to 
 hear  himself  talk  a  lot  um  I'm  about 
 action  and  action  means  less  talking  and 
 more  doing  so  that's  where  I've  been 
 what  is  that  smoke  jumping  stuff  so 
 basically  it's  um  you  know  about 
 Wildland  firefighting  about  when  the 
 forest  has  fires  there's  a  lot  of  times 
 there's  roads  and  there's  access  to  get 
 there  so  these  you  know  whether  it  be  a 
 um  hot  shot  crew  or  whatever  these 
 different  Crews  who  come  in  by  vehicle 
 they  can  get  into  the  fire  that  way  what 
 a  smoke  jumper  is  is  you  can't  get  a 
 vehicle  into  that  place  it  is  a  spot 
 where  it's  tight  there's  no  vehicles 
 there's  no  access  so  they'll  send  us  in 
 there  smoke  jumpers  jump  out  of 
 airplanes  and  we'll  land  in  these  really 
 tight  small  Drop  Zones  with  all  of  our 
 gear  and  we'll  put  the  fire  out  how  do 
 you  take  Walter  in  we  jump  out  so 
 everything  is  hang  on  you're  jumping  out 
 of  a  airplane  parachute  with  backpacks 
 of  water  like  a  camel  pack  type  thing  so 
 we'll  jump  out  we'll  have  this  it's 
 called  a  diddy  pack  and  it  and  it  sits 
 in  you  know  it  sits  like  by  your  waist 
 you  know  yep  on  your  legs  area  when  you 
 jump  out  and  that  has  a  lot  of  your  gear 
 but  what  happens  is  once  you  jump  out 
 the  aircraft  would  go  lower  and  it  will 
 push  out  all  the  rest  of  your  gear  your 
 water  pumps  oh  and  that'll  get  add  with 
 own  little 
 parachut  so  a  lot  of  our  main  gear  gets 
 dropped  into  us  and  then  we're  out  there 
 for  several  days  until  the  fire  is  put 
 out  by  us  and  only 
 us  that's  insane  it's  insane  yeah  why' 
 you  do  that  well  when  I  left  the 
 military  um  you're  I'm  always  looking 
 for  more  I'm  always  looking  for  what's 
 the  next  thing  for  myself  how  can  I  grow 
 and  that  right  there  was  the  next  thing 
 for  me  you  know  I  didn't  want  to  sit 
 back  and  you  know  just  enjoy  my 
 retirement  for  the  military  that's 
 there's  there  there's  no  growth  in  that 
 so  I  decided  to  go  out  and  do  this  so 
 you  jump  out  of  an  airplan  with  a  team 
 you  get  your  kit  also  parachuted  out  of 
 the  back  you're  now  in  the  middle  of  an 
 area  where  there's  no  Evac  there's  no 
 vehicles  that  can  come  and  get  you  m 
 there's  a  fire  mhm  you  need  to  put  the 
 fire  out  and  you  don't  stop  until  you're 
 done  that's  it  sometimes  there  is  a  way 
 to  get  out  but  a  lot  of  times  it's  just 
 you  know  if  someone  gets  hurt  on  the 
 jump  a  lot  of  times  we  have  to  build 
 like  cut  down  a  bunch  of  trees  so  a 
 helicopter  can  come  in  land  and  get  them 
 out  so  we  are  the  only  access  we  have  to 
 save  ourselves  so  a  lot  of  times  we  are 
 the  team  to  get  us  in  and  to  get  us  out 
 what  was  the 
 longest  Mission  exercise  that  you  did  I 
 think  the  longest  one  I  did  was  seven 
 days  so  and  what's  the  sort  of  daily 
 routine  are  you  sleeping  do  you  get  much 
 sleep  at  all  no  not  really  so  what 
 happens  is  and  the  thing  about  being  in 
 Canada  so  I  do  this  out  of  uh  out  of 
 British  Columbia  so  what  happens  is 
 there's  a  lot  of 
 daylight  when  I'm  so  when  I'm  out  there 
 man  there's  a  lot  of  daylight  in  the 
 middle  of  the  summer  when  it's  Hest  when 
 you've  got  tons  of  right  okay  that's 
 right  so  there's  not  much  there's  not 
 much  dark  so  you're  basically  working  a 
 lot  of  hours  so  and  then  when  it  gets 
 dark  you're  actually  working  through  the 
 nighttime  and  then  you  get  a  little  you 
 know  you  get  a  little  rest  and  you  wake 
 up  and  you're  at  it  again  and  then  when 
 the  fire  is  out  you  Patrol  the  fire  fire 
 make  sure  there's  no  more  hot  spots  make 
 sure  everything  is  black  and  wet  cuz  we 
 we  literally  wet  the  whole  area  down  so 
 there's  no  hot  spots  and  then  when 
 that's  all  done  we'll  demob  which  means 
 we'll  clean  up  all  the  stuff  all  our 
 hoses  you  know  we'll  we'll  pack  up  all 
 our  stuff  and  then  we'll  we'll  get  out 
 of  there  did  you  ask  to  be  paid  for  this 
 I  I  get  about  I  think  the  the  the  pay  is 
 about  12  to  15  bucks  an 
 hour  so  it  was  about  it  man  like  when  I 
 first  started  doing  this  job  um  people 
 didn't  know  that  you  know  I'm  actually 
 successful  in  business  and  then  it 
 realized  that  I  was  like  basically 
 turned  down  millions  of  dollars  to  do 
 this  job  and  they  can  continue  thinking 
 it  to  make  15  bucks  an  hour  to  make  15 
 bucks  an  hour  so  yeah  but  you  know  like 
 I  said  for  me  the  the  the  whole  money 
 part  of  it  it's  it's  it's  not  with  about 
 I'm  all  about  that  growth  and  and  that 
 growth  isn't  in  these  massive  paychecks 
 for  speaking  to  corporations  stuff  like 
 that  the  growth  for  me  is  in  that  12  to 
 $15  an  hour  when  you're  out  there  and 
 it's  like  20  you  know  20  degrees  and 
 you're  freezing  your  ass  off  and  you're 
 thinking  you  know  what  I  don't  need  to 
 be  here 
 anymore  and  you  start  questioning 
 yourself  why  you're  here  and  there's  a 
 lot  of  growth  in  that  why  did  you  decide 
 to  release  another  book  what  Was  undone 
 with  the  first  one  well  the  first  one 
 was  basically  um  a  bachelor's  degree 
 with  the  mind  that's  how  I  look  at  it 
 and  no  one  knew  who  I  was  so  this  is  the 
 book  never  finished  as  the  book  that  I 
 wanted  to  come  out  first  but  how  am  I 
 going  to  get  so  deep  into  something  when 
 no  one  Els  who  the  hell  I  am  so  first  I 
 have  to  give  you  some  backstory  on  who 
 the  hell  David  Goggins  is  some 
 credentials  that's  it  and  so  I  got  some 
 basic  credentials  out  there  and  now  I 
 can  dive  in  more  because  most  people 
 think  I'm  just  some  Grand  animal  who 
 runs  and  yells  and  just  says  [ __ ]  and 
 mother  [ __ ]  all  the  time  and  that's 
 nowhere  near  the  truth  that's  maybe  what 
 they  see  in  a  one  minute  video  and 
 that's  what  people  believe  but  there's  a 
 lot  of  thought  behind  a  person  being  a 
 Bor  and  loser  becoming  who  I  am  today 
 you  don't  just  wake  up  and  just  Rocky 
 the  [ __ ]  you  gotta  wake  up  and  think 
 about  you  know  there's  a  process  to 
 getting  better  and  that  process  is  never 
 finished  it's  an  appropriate  title  so 
 one  of  the  things  I've  been  thinking 
 about  is  the  danger  of  success  making 
 you  soft  and  this  must  be  something  that 
 you've  battled  with  over  the  last  few 
 years  right  more  money  more  attention 
 more  Fame  more  free  things  if  you  wanted 
 more  opportunities  to  go  places  and  do 
 stuff  with  people  right  how  have  you 
 dealt  with  this  battle  of  success  not 
 making  you  soft  you  have  to  cap  it  you 
 have  to  learn  to  cap  success  so  what  I 
 do  is  like  right  now  I  don't  like  doing 
 podcasts  there's  a  lot  of  things  I  don't 
 do  I  have  to  do  now  to  get  the  messes 
 out  there  to  help  people  out  and  what  I 
 mean  by  capping  success  I  believe 
 everybody  should  live  their  life  so 
 everything  that  someone  says  in  life 
 take  it  with  a  grain  of  salt  take  what 
 they  give  and  don't  be  like  oh  David 
 Goin  said  this  or  whoever  said  this 
 no  do  not  take  what  I  say  and  do  exactly 
 what  I  say  so  for  me  what  makes  me  who  I 
 am  because  my  mission  is  very  different 
 than  yours  anybody  else's  I  have  to  go 
 into  a  situation 
 okay  I'm  a  guy  who  wants  to  make  people 
 better  for  people  to  get  better  I  have 
 to  continuously  get  better  myself  for  me 
 to  do  that  I  can't  just  say  oh  I  have 
 this  resume  the  resume  is  there  forever 
 I'm 
 good  I  have  to  cap  My  Success  because 
 for  me  to  help  people  out  I  can't  just 
 say  I  did  it  once  and  I'm  good  I  have  to 
 continue  to  reinvent  the  will  of  the 
 mind  and  figure  out  more  and  more  ways 
 for  you  to  pull  because  if  I  have  a 
 cookie  cutter  message  it  may  hit  five 
 people  out  of  25  you  just 
 failed  my  message  needs  to  be  in  a  way 
 where  I  can  hit  all  25  people  it  needs 
 to  be  broad  enough  to  where  all  25 
 people  may  not  like  the  message  but 
 they're  getting  something  from  it  and 
 that  is  evolution  you  must  continue  to 
 evolve  and  and  you  don't  evolve  for  me 
 in  my  job  unless  I  cap  myself  somewhere 
 and  say  okay  you  made  this  much  money 
 get  back  to  [ __ ]  work  it's  time  to 
 get  back  to  work  stop  hearing  yourself 
 talk  get  off  the  podcast  don't  be  on 
 social  media  too  much  cut  out  all  the 
 [ __ ]  noise  get  back  to  the  [ __ ] 
 mental  lab  because  that's  where  the 
 knowledge  came  from  so  for  me  I  must  cap 
 myself  so  I  can  come  back  with  better 
 more  unique  knowledge  versus  the  C  know 
 all  that  cookie  hutter  knowledge  that's 
 out  there 
 that's  why  people  buy  the  books  I  have 
 because  it's  not  cookie  cutter  it's  real 
 knowledge  the  other  thing  now  is  when 
 you  first  started  you  were  a  Lone  Ranger 
 right  nobody  really  knew  who  you  were 
 outside  of  some  obscure  endurance  places 
 and  half-heard  truths  of  these  weird 
 myths  right  but  now  you've  got  people's 
 expectations  layed  on  top  as  well  so  not 
 only  have  you  got  to  deal  with  success 
 potentially  making  you  soft  so  you've 
 got  to  cap  that  you've  got  to  say  no  to 
 more  money  and  opportunities  and  cool 
 people  right  you've  also  got  this  extra 
 layer  of  expect 
 that's  coming  through  from  other  people 
 too  and  I  think  that  you  talk  about 
 trained  humility  right  in  the  new  book 
 too  I've  got  to  presume  that  that  fits 
 into  this  equation  right  it  fits  in  big 
 time  um  and  that's  one  big  reason  why  I 
 do  fight  fire  because  the  all  the 
 knowledge  for  myself  comes  from  that 
 place  it  doesn't  come  from  the  place  of 
 success  my  knowledge  does  not  come  from 
 the  place  like  because  for  me  like  I 
 built  Goggins  from  the  ground  up  I  was 
 born  David  goggin  David  gogins  wasn't 
 good  enough  enough  he  was  a  scared 
 bullied  uh  abused  kid  um  who  struggled 
 in 
 life  and  that  kid  whenever  something  got 
 tough  no  matter  how  hard  I  trained  no 
 matter  how  ready  I 
 was  whenever  something  got  tough  for  me 
 David  goggin  the  real  David  Goggins 
 would  come  out  and  he  would  quit  so  I 
 realized  this  over  a  period  of  time  so  I 
 had  to  build 
 goggin  and  in  that  process  I  have  to  go 
 back  to  that  mental  lab  and  that  mental 
 lab  is  at  scratch  that  mental  lab  isn't 
 that  trained  humility  and  so  that's 
 where  I  get  better  I  get  better  when  I'm 
 digging  holes  in  the  ground  when  I'm 
 waking  up  early  knowing  I  don't  have  to 
 do  these  things  that's  where  I  get 
 better  so  it's  important  to  stay  hungry 
 it's  important  to  stay  hungry  but  it's 
 important  more  to  stay  humble  within 
 that  hunger  so  why  you're  hungry  a  lot 
 of  people  are  hungry  but  humility  is 
 everything  what  was  that  story  about 
 William  Crawford  the  janitor  yeah  so 
 this  guy  won  the  Medal  of  Honor  so  he 
 won  the  Medal  of  Honor  and  which  is  the 
 highest  award  in  the 
 military  and  this  guy  went  to  the  Air 
 Force  Academy  and  he  was  a 
 janitor  and  no  one  knew  who  the  [ __ ] 
 this  man  was  he  had  the  highest  award  in 
 all  the  milit  military  for  heroics  for 
 heroics  saving  lives  putting  his  life  on 
 the  line  could  have  you  know  could  have 
 been  killed  and  he  is  now  basically  you 
 know  cleaning  [ __ ]  for  young  kids 
 and  we  can  all  imagine  how  that  probably 
 went  you  know  there's  probably  some  you 
 know  little  bit  of  taunting  here  and 
 there  and  he  just  sat  there  and  cleaned 
 the  [ __ ]  so  that's  why  he's  in  my 
 trained  humility  part  because  for  this 
 man  to  be  at  the  level  he  was  and  had 
 that  kind  of  humility  to  go  I'm  a  MD  of 
 Honor  winner  but  I'm  gonna  put  that  in 
 my  closet  and  I'm  gonna  pick  up  my  broom 
 and  dust  pan  and  I'm  gonna  pick  up  you 
 know  this  Rag  and  clean  this  [ __ ]  for 
 these  young  men  that  right  there  is 
 amazing  for  me  man  that's  that's  where 
 you  grow  that's  that's  growth  huge 
 growth  and  also  it  shows  that  he  was 
 doing  his 
 job  he  was  a 
 servant  he  didn't  look  at  himself  any 
 better  than  anybody  else  the  second  you 
 do  that  you're  totally  lost  you  cannot 
 look  at  yourself  like  people  with  me 
 even  I  always  look  at  people  I  I  know 
 where  you  are  I  know  where  because  I've 
 been  there  that's  why  I  helped  so  many 
 people  out  I've  I've  never  been  above 
 you  I've  always  pretty  much  been  beneath 
 you  and  that's  where  my  knowledge  came 
 from  so  I  know  how  to  reach  those  people 
 who  are  in  the  dungeon  because  I've  been 
 there  so  many  times  speaking  of  getting 
 too  soft  did  you  see  that  there  was  a 
 news  story  that  came  out  recently  about 
 the  treatment  of  seals  during  the 
 selection  process  do  you  see  this  yeah 
 yeah  I  saw  it  yeah  they  were  getting  uh 
 sprayed  with  tear  gas  whilst  they  were 
 on  the  ground  and  they  were  made  to  sing 
 Happy  Birthday  so  that  they  couldn't 
 hold  their  breath  while  it  was  happening 
 and  there  was  a  a  quote  from  uh  this  guy 
 I  think  this  type  of  training  is  really 
 senseless  said  Sven  yort  a  Juke 
 University  associate  professor  who 
 studies  tear  gas  and  its  effects  it 
 looks  more  like  a  form  of  hazing  right  I 
 see  all  that  trust  me  like  I  said  you 
 know  I'm  not  g  to  sugarcoat  anything 
 I  understand  that  guy  I  understand 
 exactly  where  you're  coming  from  that  is 
 your  personal  opinion  and  I  totally  get 
 that 
 but  there's  very  few  people  in  this 
 world  who  want  to  do  a  job  like  that  and 
 it  takes  a  different  kind  of 
 mindset  is  it  tear  grass  appropriate  I 
 don't 
 know  how  hard  that  training  is  I  don't 
 expect  anybody  to  understand  it  but  one% 
 but  the  loud  voices  of  this  world  are 
 the  99%  who  don't  understand  exactly 
 what  you  have  to  do  that's  why  when  I 
 speak  and  you  don't  understand  me  it's 
 probably  a  good  thing  because  that 
 probably  means  I'm  in  an  area  of  life 
 that  you're  not  in  which  is  fine  that's 
 why  I  don't  judge  people  and  this  guy 
 right  here  judging  that  unless  you've 
 been  there  and  done  that  and  you  really 
 can't  speak  about  it  unless  you're  in 
 those  situations  that  are  so  hard  that 
 takes  a  special  human  being  to  get 
 through  them  I  think  it's  the  same  kind 
 of  feeling  that  I  get  when  I  heard  about 
 Elon  Musk  telling  the  employees  at 
 Twitter  M  we're  going  to  ask  you  to  work 
 harder  than  you've  ever  worked  in  your 
 life  this  is  a  place  Twitter  is  now  a 
 company  where  people  can  go  if  they  want 
 to  be  in  the  top  not.  one%  of 
 hardworking  programmers  and  software 
 developers  on  the  planet  that's  right 
 and  there  was  everybody  was  up  in  arms 
 this  is  unbelievable  we're  going  back  to 
 this  old  version  of  capitalism  where  the 
 the  worker  is  being  abused  and  used  and 
 thrown  away  what  they  didn't  account  for 
 is  that  there  is  a  non  insignificant 
 cohort  of  people  for  whom  that's  their 
 dream  that's  right  people  who  want  to  be 
 able  to  get  up  on  a  morning  having  gone 
 to  bed  4  hours  before  and  can  contribute 
 to  some  sort  of  progress  that  they  think 
 this  this  is  what  I'm  here  for  yep  and 
 it's  the  same  with  the  seals  if  you're 
 not  the  sort  of  person  that  is  built  to 
 go  through  selection  it's  like  speaking 
 a  different  language 
 and  that's  why  I  don't  try  to  convince 
 people  otherwise  I  understand  that  why 
 you're  confused  I  understand  why  you  say 
 things  like  that  I'm  not  saying  anything 
 bad  about  that  I  understand  it  but  also 
 what  you  don't  understand  what  you  fail 
 to  understand  is  the  other  side  that  you 
 need  people  like  that  you  need  the  Elon 
 musks  you  need  the  David  Goggins  you 
 need  some  of  these  Navy  some  of  these 
 other  people  you  need  those  people  and 
 they  don't  they  forget  that  and  it  takes 
 a  very  very  unique  person  and  unique 
 mind  to  do  some  of  these  jobs  that  are 
 necessary  in  this  world  well  especially 
 when  we're  thinking  about  someone  going 
 to  war  right  do  you  want  your  Armed 
 Forces  to  be  underprepared  for  the 
 battlefield  because  you  didn't  want  to 
 be  too  mean  to  them  in 
 advance  that's  that's  the  problem  that's 
 the  problem  and  that's  a  problem  that 
 I've  always  had  I've  always  had  is  that 
 right  there  is  that  with  even  even  some 
 of  the  most  trained  people  in  the  world 
 fall  back  on  that  it's  easy  to  talk 
 about  like  I  said  when  you  go  through  it 
 once  when  it's  a  perishable 
 skill 
 hardness  mental  hardening  mental 
 toughness  it's  a  perishable  skill  just 
 because  you  went  through  some  training 
 once  and  you  got  through  it  doesn't  mean 
 it  lasts  [ __ ]  forever  and  that's  where 
 most  people  hated  me  in  my  life  because 
 I  realized  that  you  don't  to  say  oh  I 
 got  it  I'm  checked  off  I'm  good  for  the 
 rest  of  my  life  that's  why  you  have 
 recall  you  recall  on  [ __ ]  everything 
 and  you  definitely  must  recall  when  it 
 comes  to  the  mind  that  is  one  of  the 
 biggest  requalification  you  must  have 
 and  when  you're  at  that  level  you  gotta 
 recall  every  [ __ ]  day  not  once  a  year 
 one  of  the  other  things  that  you  did  to 
 stop  yourself  from  getting  soft  was 
 running  the  Moab  240  yep  talk  me  through 
 that  experience  so  um  I  hadn't  Run  100 
 mile  race  in  I  think  it  was  about  6 
 years  you  know  I  had  you  know  some  heart 
 surgeries  I  had  some  maybe  some 
 questioning  in  my  mind  about  I  call  it 
 part-time  Savage  I  started  kind  of  going 
 through  this  I  started  getting  you  know 
 a  little  bit  injuries  a  little  bit  this 
 a  little  that  things  that  back  in  the 
 day  never  slowed  me 
 down  so  when  I  got  my  head  out  of  my  ass 
 and  realized  that  hey  we  have  more  left 
 we  can  still  push  harder  we're  not  there 
 yet  I  realized  talking  to  a  guy  named 
 Cameron  Haynes  who  this  race  240  mile 
 race  and  um  I  say  I  go  is  this  the  is 
 this  the  new  level  is  this  the  new  is 
 this  the  new  push  so  when  I  decided  to 
 do  that  race  it  was  in  the  back  of  my 
 mind  like  man  I've  really  become  an 
 expert  at  running  100  mile  races  so  for 
 me  this  was  the  new  level  the  200  plus 
 mile  race  and  what  was  so  amazing  about 
 that  as  you  probably  read  in  the  book  I 
 had  a  hard  time  the  first  time  doing  it 
 I  came  back  and  did  better  but  what's 
 amazing  about  the  human  mind  is  that  it 
 becomes  your  new 
 Norm  like  to  to  to  think  that  I  can  run 
 200  miles  240  miles  and  that  becomes 
 like  running  50  I  never  thought  that  was 
 possible  this  is  why  I'm  I'm  always 
 pushing  that  limit  because  I  know  that 
 within  pushing  these  limits  there's 
 always  more  so  I  end  up  doing  like 
 almost  like  backtack  200  mile  runs  when 
 the  200  mile  race  240  mile  race  was  hard 
 at  once  it  became  something  that  was 
 very  easy  after  I  figured  it  out  so 
 that's  why  that  happened  well  you  got 
 lost  on  the  first  one  oh  yeah  and  then 
 you  went  to  bed  and  woke  up  halfway 
 through  the  night  and  nudged  Kish  and 
 said  how  long  have  we  got  left  until  the 
 end  of  the  race  but  because  you  hadn't 
 completed  the  official  route  you 
 couldn't  go  across  the  official  Finish 
 Line  yeah  so  you  ring  your  race  um  like 
 Pacers  some  of  whom  had  gone  home  yep 
 what  like  what  what  do  you  think  it's  3 
 in  the  morning  and  you're  ringing  people 
 saying  you  know  that  race  that  we  just 
 finished  because  of  health  problems  can 
 we  go  back  and  finish  it  so  the  crazy 
 thing  about  that  and  that  and  that's  but 
 so  I  got  lost  the  first  time  I  got 
 seriously  sick  was  off  Court  so 
 basically  I  bed  down  about  12  hours  then 
 I  got  back  in  the  race  so  I  was  still  a 
 part  of  the  official  race  now  okay  so 
 the  first  time  I  got  lost  I  I  got  sick 
 got  back  got  lost  got  back  in  the  race 
 after  12  hours  of  being  out  of  the  race 
 so  now  I  get  to  about  200  and  some  miles 
 and  I'm  sick  as  hell  can't  breathe  H  out 
 to  pulmonary  edema  totally  jacked  up  and 
 now  the  doctor  tells  me  if  if  you  get 
 off  course  now  and  you  go  to  the  doctor 
 you  won't  be  able  to  come  back  and 
 finish  the  race  so  I  had  to  make  a  call 
 like  you  know  what  I'm  pretty  messed  up 
 got  off  so  this  is  where  you're  talking 
 about  I'm  literally  laying  in  bed  and 
 I'm  feeling 
 better  and  I  thought  honestly  I  swear  to 
 God  I  thought  that  someone  was  speaking 
 to  me  I  thought  it  was  Jennifer  it  was 
 like  you're  not  done  yet  [ __ ] 
 and  I'm  like  what  the  [ __ ]  is  this  it 
 was  actually  probably  my  subconscious 
 saying  get  your  ass  back  out  there  so  I 
 wake  Jennifer  up  I'm  like  hey  how  much 
 time  do  we  have  until  the  cut  off  I  know 
 that  I'm  already  you  know  dnfed  so 
 matter  what  happens  here  I'm  not  going 
 to  be  an  official  finisher  of  this  race 
 this  isn't  for  Glory  no  this  is  now  for 
 the  fact  that  you  can  so  either  you  can 
 sit  here  and  not  and  think  about  that 
 for  a  whole  year  until  you  come  back 
 here  and  do  this  or  you  can  go  out  there 
 for  yourself  and  take  some  some  kind  of 
 pride  in  knowing  that  you  could  and  you 
 did 
 so  basically  I  wake  her  up  how  much  time 
 left  she  goes  something  like  I  don't 
 know  what  it  was  how  would  you  say  what 
 time 
 was  like  you  know  whatever  and  half  my 
 crew  had  left  and  there  was  two  people 
 there  I  woke  them  up  they  were  getting 
 ready  to  get  on  a  plane  I  said  look  can 
 you  guys  help  me  out  I  have  40  miles  to 
 go  I'm  GNA  have  Jennifer  drop  me  back 
 off  at  the  spot  where  I  left  I'm  GNA 
 finish  this  [ __ ] 
 race  and  I  couldn't  cross  the  finish 
 line  because  I  wasn't  an  official 
 finisher  so  I  end  up  finishing  on  a  road 
 on  you  know  by  a  by  a  telephone  pole  and 
 that  was  my  official  finish  end  up  being 
 like  250  M  255  miles  but  it's  one  of  the 
 best  races  of  all  time  because  we're 
 going  through  it 
 fast  but  all  the  [ __ ]  times  that  I 
 was  like  this  is  I  I'm  not  going  back 
 and  I  went  back  I'm  not  going  back  and  I 
 went  back  I'm  not  going  back  and  I  went 
 back  it  showed  me  even  more  of  what  we 
 have  as  as  as  humans  if  we're  willing  to 
 go  there  and  we're  willing  to  push  that 
 extra  step  and  like  I  said  you  know  I 
 always  tell  people  a  lot  of  people  man 
 how  do  you  do  what  you 
 do  at  the  end  of  the  day  I  ask  myself 
 one  question  can  I  take  one  more  step 
 and  usually  the  answer  is  yes  so  if  you 
 can  answer  that  question  and  not  take 
 another  step  that  is  real  failure  that 
 is  real  quitting  so  a  lot  of  people  can 
 take  one  more  step  but  they  choose  not 
 to  I  don't  know  if  you  can  take  two 
 steps  you  got  to  answer  that  question 
 after  you  take  the  first 
 step  but  I  can  always  take  one  more  step 
 so  if  I  choose  not  to  that's  on  me  and  I 
 gota  live  with  that  does  that  link  in 
 with  the  one  second  decision  yes  yes  so 
 the  one  second  decision  is  I  had  to  live 
 through  that  one  second  decision  several 
 times  during  this  race  so  this  race  took 
 me  a  hundred  and  some  hours  okay  and 
 this  is  what  people  don't  get  for  you  to 
 finish  that  race  even  though  I  dnfed  I 
 still  finished  in  the  time  so  there's  a 
 lot  of  pride  in  that  if  you're  10  and 
 some  OD  hours  let  me  use  hell  week  this 
 is  a  perfect  example  hell  week  is  130 
 hours  and  130  hours  is  a  lot  of 
 seconds  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  seconds  and  if 
 you  lose  let's  say  you  win  every  second 
 but  one 
 you 
 lost  it  only  takes  one  second  for  you  to 
 lose  the  whole  thing  so  the  one  second 
 decision  is  just  that  you're  in  a 
 situation  where  life  is  sucking  let's 
 say  you're  in  extreme  cold  water  and 
 your  life  is  flashing  before  your  eyes 
 every  time  that  wave  goes  over  your  head 
 your  thought  process  is  I  got  to  get  the 
 [ __ ]  out  of  this 
 water  and  you're  in  hell  week  and  you're 
 hour  one  of  130  [ __ ] 
 hours  it's  all  fun  and  games  okay 
 because  at  the  beginning  of  Hell  Week 
 the  guns  are  going  off  it's  like  a  pep 
 rally  so  you're  [ __ ]  hyped  up  and 
 your  boys  are  linked  arms  and  you're 
 getting  sprayed  and  it's  like  a  [ __ ] 
 peep  rally  the  instructure  yelling  at 
 your  bombs  are  going  off  concussion 
 grenades  blanks  from  in60s  yeah  who  yah 
 [ __ ]  yeah  [ __ ]  yeah  yeah  [ __ ] 
 yeah  but  then  what  they  do  is  they  shut 
 that  [ __ ]  off  they  shut  it 
 off  all  that  huah  all  that  hype  gets 
 real 
 quiet  and  they  March  you  out  to  that 
 surf  zone  for  something  called  surf 
 torture  and  it's  that  water  that  Pacific 
 Ocean  is  cold  as  [ __ ]  so  no  more  prep 
 rally  you're  now  in  your  head  you're 
 linked  arms  with  you  know  your  brothers 
 beside  you  you  don't  know  if  they  could 
 be  there  long  or  not  you  don't  care  you 
 think  about 
 yourself  you  lay  back  in  that  first  wave 
 hit 
 you  your  mind  goes  straight  from  hour 
 two  all  the  way  to  hour  130  you  can't 
 process  five  days  of  this  [ __ ]  you're 
 now  in  you're  you're  now  in  a  [ __ ]  you 
 like  I  gotta  get  out  of  here  you're  in 
 fight  or  flight  it's  cold  I  can't  be 
 cold  this  long  and  then  this  is  where 
 that  one  second  decision  comes  in  you 
 forgot  every  reason  why  you  wanted  to  be 
 there  you  don't  care  about  seals  you 
 don't  care  about  any  of  this  you  don't 
 care  about  fighting  for  your  country  you 
 don't  care  about  that  Gody  gold  Trident 
 that  they  put  on  your  chest  you  don't 
 care  about  any  of  that  [ __ ]  no  more  all 
 you  want  to  do  is  go  back  home  you  want 
 the  warmth  you  may  want  something  to  eat 
 you  want  your  girl  to  hold  you  all  those 
 things  of  comfort  are  there  in  that  one 
 second  and  this  is  where  people 
 lose  so  what  I  do  in  that  one  second 
 because  we  all  think  about  quitting  when 
 shit's  hard  but  what  you  have  to  do  in 
 that  one  second  is  hard  to  process 
 information  during 
 pain  because  that  pain  takes  over  and 
 you  can't  think  rationally  you're 
 thinking  about  fight  or  flight  save 
 yourself  that's  not  a  rational  thought 
 it's  not  a  thought  that's  going  to  get 
 you  through  hard 
 times  most  people  fail  that  one  second 
 so  what  happens  what  I  do  in  that  one 
 second  it's  and  there's  a  bigger  process 
 to  all  this  but  in  that  one 
 second  I  physically  stayed  in  in  that 
 water  because  if  I  get  out  of  the  water 
 I  quit  so  I  physically  stay  in  the  water 
 but 
 mentally  I'm  on  the  [ __ ]  beach  with 
 the  [ __ ]  instructors  and  the 
 instructors  is  cold  outside  so  they  got 
 these  Parkers  on  they  got  their  cup  of 
 [ __ ]  Joe  and  they're  warm  because 
 they've  already  been  through  it  so  now 
 it's  your  turn  to  go  through  it  so 
 mainly  I  get  back  with  them  I'm  still  in 
 the  water  physically  but  mainly  I'm  back 
 I'm  chilling  I  got  my  Parker  on  and  now 
 I'm  thinking  logically  cuz  I'm  warm  now 
 mentally  warm  I've  taken  that  one 
 second  let's  not  quit  yet  Goggins  let's 
 [ __ ]  think  about  your  options  where 
 are  you  going  to  end  up  if  you  quit  this 
 [ __ ]  where  you  gon  to  go  what  are  you  g 
 to  say  to  yourself  because  you  know 
 you're  going  to  get  warm  the  second  you 
 get  out  this  water  you  GNA  take  a  shower 
 and  you  could  be  warm  and  you  could  be 
 and  in  five  days  you  could  be  out  so  I 
 start  thinking 
 logically  I  calm  my  brain  down  because 
 your  brain  just  wants  to  get  the  [ __ ] 
 out  ring  the  bell  push  your  hmet  down 
 get  warm  and  then  you're  really  [ __ ] 
 and  these  are  the  things  you  have  to 
 think  about  the  one  second  decision  so 
 that's  what  that's  all  about  it's  about 
 gaining  control  of  your  mind  putting 
 things  back  in  the  proper 
 perspective  and  then  saying  I  really  do 
 want  to  be  here  and  I'm  G  to  have  a 
 bunch  of  these  1  seconds  through  this 
 130  hour  journey  and  I  have  to  learn  to 
 control  these  because  if  I  fail  one  of 
 these  one  seconds  I  will  not  be  a  seal  I 
 will  not  be  a  doctor  I  will  not  be  a 
 lawyer  I  will  not  be  whatever  the  [ __ ] 
 is  so  that's  how  important  that  one 
 second  decision  is  it's  all  about  your 
 mind  takes  control  of  you  you  have  to 
 say  [ __ ]  you  I  run  this 
 [ __ ]  and  that's  what  that's  all 
 about  we'll  get  back  to  Goggins  in  one 
 minute  but  first  I  need  to  tell  you 
 about  element  element  is  a  tasty 
 electrolyte  drink  mix  with  everything 
 that  you  need  and  nothing  that  you  don't 
 I've  replaced  my  morning  coffee  with 
 element  every  day  for  over  3  years  now

 optimized  my  hydration  my  brain  feels

 lm.com 
 modern  wisdom  projecting  yourself 
 forward  to  see  what  are  the  consequences 
 of  failing  what  are  the  consequences  of 
 stopping  yep  is  about  as  powerful  of  a 
 motivation  strategies  as  I  can  think  of 
 you  know  because  what  you're  doing  is 
 you're  trying  to  optimize  right  now  to 
 stop  the  discomfort  that's  right  but 
 what  you're  going  to  pay  for  that  in  is 
 shame  and  guilt  and  regret  long  term 
 that's  right  so  what  you  need  to  be  able 
 to  do  is  bundle  all  of  that  up  that  is 
 as  yet  unfelt  but  will  last  for  way  way 
 way  longer  you  know  the  future  is  much 
 longer  than  now  that's  right  the  future 
 is  going  to  extend  out  up  until  the  day 
 that  you  die  and  the  now  is  just  for  now 
 and  even  130  hours  is  just  130  hours 
 that's  right  and  you  get  to  look  back 
 and  do  you  look  back  with  Pride  and 
 Glory  or  do  you  look  back  with  shame  and 
 guilt  that's  it  that's  that's  the  one 
 second  you  just  summarized  it  right 
 there  and  most  people  fail  those  one 
 seconds  and  then  that  one  second  leads 
 to  20  years  30  years  40  Years  of  [ __ ]  I 
 have  people  who  have  been  through 
 training  with  me  Ranger  school  SEAL 
 training  Air  Force  training  and  I  get 
 calls  from  them  today  and  they  have 
 great  lives  and  all  they  talk  about  is 
 how  they  failed  in  that  one  moment  and 
 they  can't  even  great  they  can't  even 
 enjoy  eny  their  life  now  because  they're 
 now 
 warm  they're  now  warm  there's  no  more 
 suffering  there's  no  more  suffering  for 
 me  either  and  we're  in  the  same  boat  now 
 but  you're  suffering  and  so  we're  not 
 suffering  but  you're  thinking  about  what 
 you  could  have  been  I  am  exactly  what  I 
 should  have  been  and  that's  where  people 
 start  to  lose  it  because  now  I  realize 
 that  in  that  one  second  I  go  through  all 
 that  I  know  how  it's  going  to  feel  CU  I 
 failed  so  many  times  before  failure  is 
 the  ultimate  thing  man  I  failed  so  many 
 times  before  that's  why  I  don't  look  at 
 failure  anymore  as  failure  I  look  as  my 
 first  second  and  third 
 attempt  so  that's  what  that's  all  about 
 man  well  I  mean  you  went  back  to  go  and 
 do  Moab  again  the  second  time  right 
 which  is  your  second  attempt  that's 
 right  had  you  banged  your  knee  up  it  was 
 pretty  bad  in  between  the  first  and  the 
 second  one  it  was  pretty  bad  way  before 
 either  one  of  them  uhhuh  yeah  yeah  it 
 was  it's  been  jacked  up  now  for  about  20 
 years  I've  seen  some  nly  photos  of  it 
 recently  it  looks  yeah  yeah  interesting 
 yeah  so  all  those  miles  I've  run  on  this 
 thing  it's  it's  uh  it's  been  a  lot  of  uh 
 it's  been  a  lot  of  gut  checks  so  you  go 
 back  you  do  Moab  a  second  time  yep  and 
 then  you  turn  your  ass  into  like  a 
 hamburger  or 
 something  as  well  so  it's  not  just  the 
 knee  it's  the  ass  as  well  now  yeah  so  at 
 Mile  2011  we  have  a  good  video  of  it 
 matter  of  fact  Jennifer  is  like  there's 
 some  people  up  so  at  at  so  201  is  a  spot 
 where 
 I  was  really  finished  in  the  first  Moab 
 so  that  was  a  um  way  Mark  a  checkpoint 
 for  you  the  second  time  so  Jennifer  is 
 extremely  happy  right  now  because  I'm 
 there  yes  and  she  knows  I'm  doing  well 
 now  I'm  doing  good  we're  gonna  get 
 through  this  and  so  she's  videoing  me  as 
 I'm  coming  up  this  climb  on  this  road 
 and  she  goes  there's  some  people  up  here 
 who  want  to  meet  you  you're  doing  so 
 amazing  I  said  my  ass  is  [ __ ]  up  you 
 need  to  get  the  [ __ ]  desant  cream  and 
 it's  literally  for  like  20  [ __ ] 
 miles  that  like  people  don't  get  it  man 
 when  you  get  raw  like  that  bro  and 
 you're  walking  cuz  you  the  the  chaing  of 
 my  ass  it  was  hamburger  meat  and  I'm 
 like  so  she's  all  [ __ ]  happy  and  [ __ ] 
 she's  and  I  just  look  at  her  and  I'm 
 gonna  put  the  video  up  on  social  media 
 cuz  it's  it's  but  she's  a  [ __ ] 
 Trooper  bro  hang  on  so  could  she  was  the 
 leakage  oh  yeah  that  was  on  the  video 
 from  behind  so  my  shorts  were  absolutely 
 raw  dogged  yeah  so  when  you  pull  them 
 down  it's  just  blood  and  so  she  goes  in 
 the  bathroom  because  she  didn't  know 
 what  she  was  going  to  see  she  has  a 
 Destin  cream  she  walks  in  there  and  I 
 pull  them  down  and  spread  them  open  and 
 I  go  put  that  [ __ ]  all  up  in  there  so 
 she  goes  in  for  the  kid 
 and  she's  putting  this  Destin  cream  all 
 over  the  [ __ ]  place  man  and  you  know 
 what  this  the  funny  thing  about  it  Dash 
 when  you  know  you  got  a  good 
 [ __ ]  with  you  man  when  you're 
 that  raw  and  you're  that  [ __ ]  up  and 
 she's  just  like  nothing  it  was  like 
 saying  hey  can  you  like  put  some  lotion 
 on  my  back  before  I  go  lay  out  that's 
 how  she  was  in  there  man  getting  in  it 
 that's  it  man  have  you  considered  that 
 that  might  be  the  most  traumatic  event 
 of  all  of  the  things  that  you've  done  in 
 your  life  what  you  asked  Jennifer  to  do 
 that  day  no  not  at  all  she  did 
 worse  so  that  Leadville  chapter  when  I 
 talk  about  after  I  finished  and  then  the 
 ultra  raveling  or  unraveling  had  had 
 begun  when  I  lay  down  so  oh  that  was  on 
 the  duvet  and  you  didn't  know  the  word 
 duv  yeah  I  know  what  the  [ __ ]  duve  was 
 [ __ ]  you  don't  know  the  word  duv  blanket 
 man  okay  fair  enough  fair  enough  fair 
 enough  out  from  the  streets  we  call  them 
 blankets  anything  that  you  wrap  up  in  as 
 a  [ __ ]  blanket  cool  so  I'm  laying  on 
 the  duvet 
 and  she's  all  [ __ ]  like  about  her 
 damn  ratings  that  [ __ ]  the  Airbnb 
 [ __ ]  and  I'm  L  like  hey  I'm  about  to 
 [ __ ]  right  here  because  it's  not  your 
 place 
 no  okay  no  right  yes  I  can  see  why  she 
 be  consern  so  that  scene  is  uh  is  is  was 
 was  bad  but  once  again  like  a  crime 
 scene  it's  yes  it  was  a  crime  scene  so 
 you've  done  all  of  this  stuff  right 
 you've  done  the  seal  selection  week 
 three  times  strapping  the  legs  up  so 
 that  you  can  Runner  badwater  Ultra  race 
 the  Asbergers  everything  yes  of  all  of 
 the  physical  Pursuits  that  you've 
 endured  which  has  been  the  most  painful 
 by  far  by  far  my  first  100  mile 
 race  by  far  this 
 2019  Moab  the  one  that  I  D  enough  but 
 still  finished  that's  up  there  but  when 
 you 
 are  um  so  I  guess  you're  you're  you're 
 not  prepared  to  run  100  miles  and  you 
 take  it  for  granted  and  you  didn't  do 
 any  training  at  all  and  you  didn't  have 
 the  right  nutrition  and  off  of  whim  like 
 literally  like  you  know  what  I  want  to 
 raise  money  for  a  foundation  that's  how 
 that  happened  so  I  don't  know  if  you 
 know  the  story  or  not  but  basically  I'm 
 sitting  there  and  the  Lan  Survivor 
 incident  happened  where  a  bunch  of  you 
 know  some  seals  died  I  want  to  raise 
 money  for  them  I  went  through  training 
 with  most  of  these  guys  so  I  had  the 
 bright  idea  to  uh  raise  money  you  know  I 
 wasn't  going  to  do  a  hot  dog  or 
 hamburger  sale  I  was  going  to  do 
 something  that  people  would  be  attracted 
 to  so  I  Googled  the  world's  toughest 
 events  and  what  comes  up  is  this  race 
 called  the  badwater 
 135  and  it's  135  mile  race  through  Death 
 Valley  in  the  summertime  now  I  had  no 
 idea  about  ultr  running  I  didn't  know 
 what  the  [ __ ]  ultr  running  was  but  when 
 I  heard  so  when  I  saw  135  miles  I 
 automatically  assumed  it  was  a  stage 
 race  where  you  ran  like  maybe  10  15 
 miles  bed  down  and  you  got  up  next 
 morning  did  it  so  when  I  called  the  race 
 director  up  Chris  Cosman  I'm  like  hey  I 
 would  like  to  do  this  race  to  raise 
 money  for  a  foundation  he  goes  have  you 
 ever  run  a  100 
 miles  and  I  was  like  like  in  in  a  week 
 or  like  like  what  are  you  talking  about 
 he  goes  no  like  in  24  hours  because 
 that's  what  you  got  to  do  to  qualify  and 
 I  was  like  is  that  even  is  that  even 
 possible  like  I  I  didn't  know  so  anyway 
 he  goes  no  you  can't  get  in  my  race 
 unless  you  qualify  and  I  call  him  up  on 
 a  Wednesday  and  that  Saturday  and  I  was 
 a  bodybuilder  at  the  time  I  did  cardio 
 20  minutes  a  week  on  the  elliptical 
 trainer  every  Sunday  he  goes  yeah 
 Saturday  you're  in  San  Diego  Saturday  is 
 uh  24hour  race  where  you  run  around  a 
 one  mile  track  for  24  hours  and  if  you 
 can  get  100  miles  I'll  consider  you  my 
 race  so  I'll  go  sign  up  for  this  race 
 and  the  first  70  miles  I'm  doing  pretty 
 good  and  then  I  hadn't  sat  down  I  was  uh 
 hadn't  gone  to  the  bathroom  I  was  eating 
 I  was  drinking  myoplex  and  Rich  crackers 
 I  was  you  know  eating  Rich  crackers  so 
 Elite  nutrition  yeah  elite  elite  high 
 quality 
 nutrition  so  what  happens  when  you're 
 that  ignorant  and  you  go  out  to  do  this 
 race  and  you  sit  down  in  a  chair  your 
 body's  done  so  I'm  sitting  there  and 
 when  you  sit  down  for  the  first  time  in 
 over  12  hours 
 your  body's  now  going  through  some 
 metamorphosis  like  go  [ __ ]  home  go  go 
 to  a  doctor  get  some  help  but  I'm 
 sitting  there  and  I  have  this  urge  to  go 
 to  the 
 bathroom  and  there's  a  porter  potty  for 
 me  that  [ __ ]  wall  but  I  can't  get  up 
 because  my  blood  pressure  is  all  messed 
 up  from  my  great  nutrition  that  I  was  on 
 and  so  I  can't  stand  up  so  I  look  at  my 
 ex-wife  and  I  literally  say  I'm  want  to 
 [ __ ]  on  myself  right  now  so  I  sit  there 
 and  I'm  I'm  [ __ ]  up  my  back  and  I'm 
 peeing  blood  down  my  leg  and  I  have  30 
 miles  to  go  and  I  end  up  finding  away  to 
 get  through  that  30  miles  and  when  I  got 
 done  with  that 
 race  it's  the  worst  pain  I  can  ever  even 
 I  can't  even  describe  the  pain  of  that 
 last  30  miles  to  anybody  no  one  it's 
 very  hard  whole  body  whole  body  I'm  so 
 when  it  ended  I  I  I'm  literally 
 dizzy  going  up  my  stairs  to  to  get  to  my 
 house  I'm  literally  I  have  my  arms 
 wrapped  around  her  going  up  the  stairs 
 and  every  flight  of  stairs  I  got  have  to 
 lay  down  because  I  can't  stay  upright 
 for  too  long  or  I'm  G  pass  out  so  I 
 finally  get  in  the  house  and  when  I  get 
 in  the  house  I'm  once  again  on  the  floor 
 I'm  in  the  kitchen  on  the  floor  just 
 laying  there  I  finally  make  it  to  the 
 bathroom  into  the  tub  I  get  rolled  in 
 the  tub  and  she  puts  the  water  on  me  I'm 
 just  laying  there  with  the  water  coming 
 on  me  and  what  I  pee  out  looks  like 
 cocacola  and  I'm  laying  there  in  the 
 worst  pain  of  my  entire  life  I'm  shaken 
 I'm  jacked  up  and  all  I  could  think 
 about 
 was  I  can't  believe  what  I  just  done 
 because  when  you  get  to  70  miles  of  a 
 race  and  you  felt  the  way  I 
 did  it's  to  me  it  was  humanly  impossible 
 to  even  think  about  going  30  more  miles 
 in  that  shape  and  once  you  do  it  what 
 what  came  over  me  when  that  shower  hit 
 me  and  the  reality  hit  that  I  SP  101 
 miles  and  that  last  31  miles  was 
 something  that  I  can't  even  describe  to 
 people  and  she's  like  we  got  get  you  to 
 the  hospital  so  at  the  time  my  mom  was 
 seeing  this  doctor  and  he  was  like  you 
 know  so  so  she's  describing  to  my  mom 
 I'm  going  through  he's  like  you  gotta 
 get  in  the  hospital  now  and  I  just  said 
 just  just  shut  up  and  let  me  enjoy  this 
 pain  I  don't  want  anything  to  numb  it  I 
 don't  want  anything  right  now  because 
 what  I  had  done  was  I  just  in  my  mind 
 and  people  would  take  this  wrong  and 
 take  as  wrong  as  you  want  to  I  don't 
 really  care  I  had  just  climbed  a  mental 
 wall  that  was  amazing  and  I  didn't  want 
 anybody  to  take  that  pain  away  from  me 
 at  that  point  because  that  was  that  was 
 all  confirmation  it  seems  like  I've 
 heard  you  tell  that  story  a  number  of 
 times  amazing 
 did  that  set  the  tone  or  the  Rhythm  for 
 what  you  wanted  to  try  and  Achieve  and 
 feel  again  each  time  there's  you're 
 pushing  further  there's  more  difficulty 
 I  never  want  to  feel  it  again  I  never 
 want  to  feel  it  again  but  what  it  did 
 was  it  showed  me  what  is  possible  and 
 that's  what  set  the  new  stage  for  me 
 that's  when  I  realized  oh  man  I've 
 really  been  underachieving  my  entire 
 life  I'm  not  saying  that  you  have  to  go 
 to  that  place  because  that  place  is  a 
 dangerous  dangerous  place  that 
 borderline  rabdo  heart  everything  it  was 
 borderline  rabo  it  was  all  that  y  but 
 you  don't  you  don't  want  to  go  there  but 
 it  taught  me  what  is  possible  so  from 
 that  19-hour  lesson  one  the  best  biggest 
 lesson  had  my  life  it  it  taught  me  like 
 okay  I  got  it  check  tell  me  about  this 
 mixed  type  of  hate  that  you've 
 made  so  what  started  happening 
 is  as  you  get  bigger  as  you  get  more 
 successful  you  open  the  door  for  people 
 to  critique  every  [ __ ]  thing  you  do 
 and  most  of  the  people  who  are 
 critiquing  you  usually  aren't  where  you 
 are  and  all  their  critiquing  comes  from 
 people  who  are  really  at  a  low  level  of 
 life  which  is  sad  but  what  we  do  people 
 who  are  on  the  upper  level  hearing  the 
 haters  at  the  lower  level  like  I  said 
 you'll  never  meet  a  hater  doing  better 
 than  you  true 
 statement  I  started  having  fun  with  it 
 so  I'll  go  through  the  comments  while 
 while  most  people  don't  go  through 
 comments  I  go  through  and  intentionally 
 look  for  the  bad 
 ones  and  while  I'll  block  and  delete  you 
 because  the  people  on  my  page  don't  need 
 that  negative  energy  I'll  block  and 
 delete  you  but  I  take  a  snapshot  on  my 
 phone  and  I  put  it  in  the  archive  so 
 what  happens  is  there's  days  where  I'm 
 like  you  know  what  I  really  don't  want 
 to  do  this  today  I'm  like  oh  hang  on  so 
 I  started  making  these  mixtapes  with  all 
 of  these  hate  messages  about  people 
 talking  [ __ ]  and  it  became  such  a  source 
 of  fuel  that  it  was  amazing  because  I 
 know  why  you  hate  me  you  hate  me  because 
 you're  probably  in  the  bed  right  now 
 you're  probably  an  underachiever  you're 
 probably  somebody  who  doesn't  want  to  do 
 anything  with  your  life  so  I  make  you 
 question  question  everything  about 
 yourself  so  I'm  going  to  continue  making 
 you  question  yourself  by  coming  out  here 
 and  being  even  more  successful  so  I 
 listen  to  that  while  I  run  I  sometimes 
 played  in  the  house  and  it  sometimes 
 gets  on  Jennifer's  [ __ ]  nerves 
 because  I'm  sitting  and  listen  to 
 Somebody  talk  mad  [ __ ]  on  a  loop  about 
 me  and  she's  like  why  do  you  do  this 
 [ __ ]  it's  half  comical  and  it's  half  um 
 it's  half  inspiring  I'm  actually 
 inspired  by  it  I've  heard  you  say 
 previously  that  listening  to  music  while 
 you  train  is  cheating  MH  so  what  you're 
 telling  me  MH  is  that  the  Silence  of 
 your  own  dark  thoughts  isn't  enough  of  a 
 soundtrack  and  you've  had  to  crowdsource 
 insults  from  the  internet  self  narrate 
 it  yep  and  then  play  it  to  yourself 
 while  you  train  that's  it  I  do  that 
 sometimes  yes  yes  have  you  got  your 
 phone  on  your  right  now  I  want  to  hear 
 it  no  I  I  don't  travel  with  my  phone  oh 
 yeah  my  phone  does  not  go  with  me 
 anywhere  why  is  that 
 once  again  man  like  right  now  I'm  with 
 you  a  lot  of  times  people  are  in 
 conversations  or  they're  somewhere  they 
 elsewhere  you  may  think  they're  with  you 
 but  they're  not  that  phone  is  the 
 biggest  distraction  in  the  world  when 
 time  so  when  it  comes  time  for  the  phone 
 I'm  on  the  phone  when  not  I  don't  use  it 
 I'm  all  about  being  present  where  I'm  at 
 so  that's  why  that  phone  right  now  no  we 
 do  have  it  it's  in  your  it's  silenced 
 it's  off  so  I  do  have  my  phone  right  now 
 but  but  usually  I  don't  take  it  anywhere 
 go  got  you  so  while  you're  listening  to 
 the  self-  narrated  insults  of  random 
 people  on  the  internet  that  you  don't 
 like  right  what  are  you  thinking  of 
 while  you're  listening  to  that  while 
 you're  working  out  or  while  you're 
 walking  around  the  house  how  that  back 
 in  the  day  when  I  was  sometimes  getting 
 bullied  or  in  a  dark  place  how  sometimes 
 that  would  have  bothered  me  how  I  would 
 want 
 to  clap  back  I  I  would  want  to  be  on 
 there  all  day  explaining  myself  to 
 people  and  how  now  I'm  in  a  place  now 
 where  I  can  hear  it  and  I  can  actually 
 enjoy  it  I  can  actually  know  where  it's 
 coming  from  I've  studied  it  so  I  don't 
 just  like  listen  to  it  and  like  make  fun 
 of  it  I  actually  study  it  because  I  was 
 once  that  negative  person  I  was  once 
 that  person  who  saw  someone 
 successful  and  didn't  see  how  can  I  get 
 there  I  was  like  oh  [ __ ]  that  they're 
 probably  cheating  or  they're  probably 
 doing  this  I  was  I  was  that  negative 
 person  because  I  wasn't  there  and  I 
 didn't  want  to  work  to  get  there  so 
 these  people  who  hate  on  people  I've 
 studied  them  and  I've  gained  a  lot  of 
 Knowledge  from  them  because  I  gain  a  lot 
 of  knowledge  for  myself  when  I  was  in 
 that  dark  place  so  it's  almost  like 
 reflecting  an  older  version  of  you  back 
 to  yourself  100%  I  had  this  idea  um  uh 
 called  the  reverse  role  model  so  in  a 
 lot  of  places  people  might  grow  up  and 
 not  have  good  Role  Models  around  them 
 you  know  like  it  would  be  great  if  I  had 
 someone  that  was  my  hero  that  could  tell 
 me  how  to  be  X  uh  good  in  school  well 
 with  work  fantastic  in  relationships 
 whatever  it  might 
 be  and  a  lot  of  people  don't  grow  up 
 with  that  right  and  what  I  realized  was 
 cuz  that  was  me  in  in  part  from  where  I 
 was  from  but  I  realized  there  was  a  lot 
 of  people  that  I  got  to  see  that  were 
 like  the  sort  of  person  I  didn't  want  to 
 be  like  right  and  that  was  the  reverse 
 role  model  so  I  could  look  around  and  I 
 could  say  well  I  really  don't  want  his 
 relationship  with  his  wife  and  I  hate 
 the  way  that  he  is  using  alcohol  to  get 
 over  the  problems  in  his  life  he  he 
 doesn't  have  any  Integrity  or  tell  the 
 truth  she  is  a  liar  and  a  backstabber 
 and  a  gossip  and  the  thing  is  that  you 
 can  actually  achieve  a  lot  of  success  in 
 life  by  avoiding  failure  like  most 
 success  in  life  actually  is  avoiding 
 failure  yes  you  need  to  be  able  to  be 
 competent  But  first  you  need  to  not  get 
 out  of  the  race  that's  the  one  second 
 decision  right  you  need  to  not  lose 
 before  you  can  win  right  and  the  reverse 
 role  model  is  you  weaving  your  way 
 through  a  selection  of  people  that  you 
 don't  want  to  be  like  and  I  think  that 
 you  can  get  an  awfully  long  way  just  by 
 doing  that  I  did  that  my  entire  life  I 
 had  the  ultimate  blueprint  by  watching 
 my  family  I  was  the  youngest  kid  so  the 
 youngest  kid  has  the  total  Advantage  you 
 know  you  may  get  picked  on  you  may  get 
 bullied  with  everybody  but  you  sit  back 
 in  the  exactly  what  you  said  I  sat  back 
 and  watched  my  dad  definitely  don't  want 
 to  do  that  my  mom  my  brother  whoever  it 
 may  be  I  sat  back  and  I  paid  attention 
 to  everything  around  me  and  it  was  the 
 ultimate  blueprint  to  how  to  live  life 
 how  not  to  live  life  how  not  to  live 
 life  is  I  watched  people  do  [ __ ]  and  I 
 said 
 H  I  don't  want  to  be  like  that  I  like 
 what  you  said  about 
 how  the  criticism  that  you  see  from 
 people  is  coming  from  a  very  unique 
 place  I  think  if  you  got  to  see  the 
 inner  texture  of  the  people  who  don't 
 like  use  existence  you'd  feel  more  pity 
 than  anger  for  the  most  part  I  think 
 you'd  pity  them  yes  um  and  that's  a 
 realization  that's  taken  a  long  time  for 
 me  to  to  come  up  with  because  everybody 
 else  feels  or  to  me  it  always  seems  like 
 everyone  else  has  got  it  together 
 because  I  get  to  see  only  what  you 
 choose  to  say  only  what  I'm  around  you 
 doing  that  I  get  to  see  whereas  I  get  to 
 observe  my 
 own  inefficiency  and  foibles  10,000 
 times  a  second  right  I  get  to  watch  the 
 texture  of  my  own  mind  be  completely 
 unresponsive  and  useless  I  see  every 
 single  um  prideful  decision  every  single 
 lie  that  I  tell  myself  every  single  time 
 I  make  a  promise  and  don't  keep  it  mhm 
 but  I  don't  get  to  see  that  from 
 everyone  so  I'd  always  presume  because 
 of  this  asymmetry  that  everybody  else 
 had  it  sorted  and  I  didn't  and  it  also 
 made  me  think  that  everybody  else's 
 opinion  was  this  perfectly  balanced  well 
 researched  beautifully  it  was  it  was 
 they  had  they  had  me  nailed  down  to  a 
 tea  what  they  were  telling  me  was  the 
 truth  they  could  see  something  in  me 
 that  I  couldn't  right  and  after  a  little 
 bit  of  time  and  a  good  bit  of  building 
 up  of  selfconfidence  I  realized  that 
 that's  not  the  case  no  I  have  pity  on  a 
 lot  of  people  I  do  um  I  used  to  get 
 angry  about  it  like  there  was  this  guy  I 
 talked  about  it  on  on  Rogan  this  guy 
 from  s  team  six  who  went  out  there  when 
 I  became  started  becoming  more  famous  he 
 went  out  there  and  just  try  to  destroy 
 me  tried  to  literally  destroy  me  talked 
 about  how  you  know  he  just  totally  lied 
 totally  lied  had  to  get  a  lawyer  against 
 him  all  all  kind  of  [ __ ]  and  I  was 
 getting  ready  to  Sue  this  guy  had  a 
 great  I  was  going  to  sue  him  because  he 
 literally  tried  to  destroy  my  character 
 my  reputation  went  out  there  in  this 
 lest  ass 
 off  I  thought  to 
 myself  it's  about  two  months  into  it  I 
 sat  back  and  I  started  feeling  sorry  for 
 this  guy  like  really  sorry  for  him  I  was 
 I  was  goingon  to  pull  a  trigger  sue  him 
 and  I  said  I'm  not  gonna  Sue  this  guy  I 
 said  for  you  to  be  this  person  who  comes 
 on  and  lies  and  tries  to  literally  tear 
 down 
 everything  I've  worked  for  you  are  in  a 
 very  very  bad  place  come  to  find  out  he 
 was  in  a  very  bad  mental  place  so  I  get 
 what  you're  saying  I've  learned  to  study 
 people  before  I  react  because  there's  no 
 successful  person  in  the  world  who's  in 
 a  good  head  space  that's  going  to  ever 
 attack  anyone  in  that  kind  of  manner 
 there's  always  going  to  be  something 
 wrong  with  them  so  you  got  to  always 
 dive  a  little  deeper  before  you  get  your 
 feelings  hurt  before  you  get  your 
 feelings  hurt  by  that  bully  at  school  or 
 that  boss  at  work  take  time  take  that 
 one  second  to  pull  back  and  study  them 
 because  most  people  who  are  in  good 
 places  they  don't  they  don't  care  about 
 what  you're  doing  they  don't  care  about 
 what  you're  doing  they  don't  try  to 
 destroy  you  they  actually  will  try  to 
 build  you  up  versus  destroy  who  you  are 
 as  a  person  so  that's  where  I'm  at  now 
 in  life  is  most  people  who  do  that 
 they're  in  a  very  dark  dark  place  I've 
 got  a  ton  more  to  talk  to  goggin  about 
 but  first  I  need  to  tell  you  about  ag1

 wisdom  what  do  you  think  most  people  get 
 wrong  about 
 motivation  they  think  it's  a  permanent 
 fix  they  think  it's  something  that  that 
 is  a  constant  they  think  that  maybe  once 
 I  get  it  I'm  gonna  hold  on  to 
 it  and  that's  the  thing  about  that  I  was 
 telling  you  I  always  talk  about  is 
 nothing  is  permanent  nothing  is 
 permanent  and  a  lot  of  times  you  have  to 
 learn  to  perform  without 
 motivation  you  have  to  learn  to  perform 
 without  purpose  you  have  to  learn  to 
 perform  a  lot  of  different  things  and 
 that's  what  people  think  they  think  I 
 need  to  have  this 
 motivation  to  work  out  to  study  to  be 
 better  so  if  they  don't  have  it  they 
 just  don't  [ __ ]  do  it  and  that's 
 where  you 
 fail  you  have  to  learn  to  train  your 
 mind  well  beyond  motivation  if  you  have 
 motivation  that's  great  that's  some 
 kindling  to  the  fire  all  it  takes  is  a 
 little  bit  of  [ __ ]  spark  you  can  burn 
 a  whole  Forest  up  but  motivation  you 
 have  to  learn  to  exist  without  it  you 
 have  to  learn  to  be  you  have  to  be  your 
 best  self  when  you're  least 
 motivated  and  that's  the  tricky  part 
 about  all  that  [ __ ]  motivation  is  just  a 
 word  you  have  to  have  these  different 
 things  in  your  mind  on  where  you  want  to 
 go  and  know  that  motivation  is  not  going 
 to  get  me  there  CU  I'm  not  going  to 
 always  be  motivated  said  the  exact  same 
 thing  you  said  that  discipline  needs 
 motivation  for  breakfast  and  discipline 
 is  good  too  but  without  a  clear  head 
 space  there's  no  discipline  what  you 
 mean  so  let's  say  we  have  a  circuit 
 breaker  okay  and  I'm  loading  everything 
 up  to  one  [ __ ]  circuit  just  load  it 
 up  it's  gonna  [ __ ] 
 blow  and  once  that  thing  blows  man  the 
 circuit's  all  [ __ ] 
 up  you  got  to  have  each  thing  plugged 
 into  the  right  SP  spot  like  a  [ __ ] 
 crowded 
 garage  you  can't  put  anything  in  it  once 
 your  brain  is  crowded  discipline  is 
 great  motivation  is  great  but  if  you 
 can't  fit  [ __ ]  in  your  brain  because 
 it's  all  [ __ ]  cluttered  with 
 [ __ ]  there's  no 
 discipline  you  may  have  it  sometimes 
 when  it  fits  in  that  crowded  garage  of 
 your  mind  but  you  don't  have  the 
 consistency  that  you  need  to  have  with 
 that  discipline  so  what  are  you  talking 
 about  here  are  you  saying  doing  self 
 work  and  reflecting  on  you  as  an 
 individual  are  you  doing  therapy  call  I 
 call  it  my  I  call  it  mental  zones  I 
 don't  get  into  it  much  because  it  be  all 
 day  but  basically  is  you're  organizing 
 your  mind  so  you  can  put  that  discipline 
 so  a  lot  of  people  talk  about  discipline 
 okay  great  why  do  you  fall  off  the 
 [ __ ]  wagon  why  can't  I  continue  with 
 this  routine  going  to  the  gym  being 
 better  waking  up  early  eating  the  right 
 Foods  it's  because  maybe  it's  your  kids 
 maybe  it's  your  wife  maybe  it's  your  job 
 and  it's  all  just  stuffed  in  your 
 [ __ ]  brain  you  don't  have  it 
 compartmentalized  and  organized  in  these 
 nice  shelves  like  you  look  in  a  garage 
 it's  all  [ __ ]  a  nice  organized 
 militant  garage  hey  where  are  my 
 dumbbells  right  there  a  lot  of  people 
 whose  brain  Hey  where's  my  Dum  H  let  me 
 look  they're  [ __ ]  throwing  [ __ ] 
 they're  looking  through  totes  they're 
 all  [ __ ]  up  so  where  am  I  going  to  put 
 discipline  in  that  mind  if  I  can't  find 
 other  [ __ ] 
 you  got  to  be  able  to  find  all  these 
 different  things  in  your  mind  oh  I  can 
 put  discipline  right  there  I  can  put 
 consistency  right  there  I  can  put  all 
 these  things  right  there  in  that  spot  so 
 that's  what  I'm  talking  about  if  your 
 life  is  not 
 organized  in  your  life  being  everything 
 around  you  because  it  takes  one  little 
 [ __ ]  up  piece  of  an  outside 
 interference  to  Cutter  your  whole  mind 
 because  it's  on  such  a  knife  edge  that's 
 right  and  people  don't  get  that  your 
 mind  has  to  always  be  clear  that's  why 
 Mo  that's  why  I  meditate  two  hours  every 
 single  night  because  I  refresh  I 
 reorganize  the  garage  which  is  my  mind 
 every  night  so  then  discipline's  in 
 there  organization  everything  is  in  this 
 right  spot  so  when  I  wake  up  I'm  ready 
 to  go  what  does  a  morning  look  like  for 
 you  at  the  moment  have  you  got  a  routine 
 of  some  kind  yes  I  run  every  single 
 morning  so  that's  what  time  you  up  when 
 are  you  waking  up  I'm  up  about  5  5:30  so 
 every  morning  starts  with  a  run  and 
 that's  because  that's  the  one  thing  I 
 hate  to  do  more  than  anything  in  the 
 world  so  that's  like  my  cup  of  coffee 
 and  I'm  all  about  armoring  yourself  so 
 the  second  you  leave  your  house  and  the 
 second  you  open  your  phone  the  second 
 you  do  any  of  that  [ __ ]  you  are  now 
 letting  them  poison  in 
 cancer  so  I  make  sure  a  lot  of  things 
 you  can't  avoid  so  as  I  get  up  I  start 
 to  armor  plate  my  mind  and  body  like  a 
 person's  going  to  war  you  put  your  body 
 armor  on  that's  what  I'm  doing  on  that 
 run  I'm  waking  up  and  I'm  giving  myself 
 all  this  armor  so  when  I  come  out  in  the 
 world  now  look  at  that  phone  I'm  ready 
 I'm  not  waking  up  late  I'm  not  rushing 
 around  I'm  not  disorganized  because  I 
 know  I'm  gonna  get  hit  in  the  [ __ ] 
 mouth  there's  a  there's  an  art  to 
 getting  hit  in  the  [ __ ] 
 mouth  and  that  is  why  these  things  are 
 important  you  have  to  wake  up  and  you 
 have  to  give  yourself  belief  you  have  to 
 give  yourself  confidence  so  that  it 
 starts  with  that  run  so  after  the  run  I 
 come  home  I  eat  something  small  how 
 long's  the  Run  typically  at  the  moment 
 nowhere  Under  12  miles  so  12  miles  is 
 the  minimum  and  what  are  you  getting 
 that  done  in  how  long  it  depends  right 
 now  I'm  running  a  heart  rate  so  I'm 
 running  like  815s  830s  cuz  I'm 
 retraining  right  now  because  is  that 
 zone  two  for  you  zone  two  because  of  the 
 leg  I  had  so  I'm  going  back  starting 
 from  scratch  so  anywhere  from  about  an 
 hour  30  to  two  hours  I  run  every  day  mhm 
 so  that's  so  you're  fasted  on  the 
 morning  up  straight  out  straight  out  90 
 minutes  to  two  hours  of  running  back  eat 
 eat  and  I'm  in  the  gym  so  and  then  after 
 that  um  to  whatever's  on  the  plan  for 
 the  day  that's  how  that  works  every  day 
 are  you  still  doing  your  stretching  cuz 
 you've  got  two  hours  of  you've  got  two 
 hours  of  meditation  90  minutes  to  2  of 
 running  MH  how  long's  the  gym  session 
 depends  45  to  an  hour  and  a  half  okay 
 mhm  stretching  meditation  run  M 
 eat  gy 
 M  what  is  that  my  missing  Jennifer  oh 
 yeah  yeah  forgot  about  that  you  cycle  as 
 well  yeah  how  long  are  you  cycling  it 
 just  depends  I  do  stationary  bike  right 
 now  a  lot  uhuh  what  do  youing  is  it  like 
 a  wat  bike  or  something  similar  yeah 
 something  similar  so  I  put  my  bike  on  a 
 uh  like  trainer  M  and  I  cycle  yep  at 
 least  three  or  four  days  a  week  I'll  do 
 that 
 so  that's  your  day  there's  no  there's 
 there  is  no  room  for  anything 
 else  yeah  there  is  a  lot  of  room  so 
 there's  24  hours  and  I  and  I  use  it  all 
 pretty  pretty  well  how's  your  sleep 
 what's  your  sleep  L  it's  really  good 
 okay  getting  eight  hours  is  something 
 like  that  seven  eight  hours  mhm  yeah 
 well  you  need  to  with  this  sort  of 
 volume  78  hours  and  you're  still  doing 
 your  stretching  stuff  every  night  so 
 you've  got  a  4H  hour  block  basically  of 
 stretching  meditation  that's  all  in  one 
 block  you  combine  the  two  right  yeah 
 that's  all  in  one  block  cool  yep  that's 
 one  hell  of  a  day  it  is  and  it's  been 
 like  that  for  seven  years  but  going  back 
 to  what  you  said  before  about  needing  to 
 cap  success  MH  you  wouldn't  be  able  to 
 fit  even  one  tenth  of  that  in  exactly  if 
 you  were  chasing  down  exactly  yep  that's 
 exactly  it  so  if  all  that's  [ __ ]  up 
 that's  why  I  got  a  cap  success  because  I 
 can't  put  that  in  and  and  that's  my 
 growth  factor  so  you  know  that's  that's 
 my  human  growth  factor  you  said  before 
 about  um  how  you  build  up  self-esteem 
 and  confidence  and  stuff  and  there's 
 this  quote  from  one  of  my  friends  Alex 
 hosi  that  says  you  don't  become 
 Confident  by  shouting  affirmations  in 
 the  mirror  but  by  having  a  stack  of 
 undeniable  proof  that  you  are  who  you 
 say  you  are  outwork  your  self-doubt  yes 
 that's  that's  nailed  nailed  completely 
 nailed  yes  because  a  lot  of  people  will 
 in  some  of  these  motiv  ation  people  out 
 here  it's  It's  the  funniest  thing  in  the 
 world  to  me  they'll  go  and  say  when  you 
 wake  up  in  the  morning  pound  your  chest 
 you  know  [ __ ]  look  at  yourself  in  the 
 mirror  and  do  all  this  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 I  hope  it  works  what  works  for  me  is 
 that  everyday  resume  the  things  I  know 
 I've  accomplished  the  things  I  know  I've 
 done  real  hard  work  the  real  calluses  on 
 my  mind  the  real  calluses  on  my  hands 
 that's  that's  it  that  you  don't  need  to 
 pound  your  chest  in  the  mirror  of  the 
 [ __ ]  anymore  if  you  have  that  it  seems 
 like  especially  with  confidence  right  or 
 self-esteem  there's  a  relationship 
 between  confidence  and  competence  so 
 what  you're  looking  to  do  is  try  and 
 have  what  you  believe  that  you  can  do  be 
 ahead  of  what  you  can  do  now  you're  not 
 looking  for  it  to  be  delusional  you 
 don't  want  it  to  to  be  able  to  believe 
 that  you  can  do  something  like  fly  right 
 but  you  need  to  have  a  relationship 
 between  the  two  but  what  people  are 
 asking  for  is  for  their  confidence  to  be 
 so  far  ahead  of  their  competence  that  or 
 without  having  even  been  competent  at 
 anything  in  the  beginning  and  that's 
 just  delusion  that's  fantasy  right  well 
 I  believe  that  you  have  to  build 
 belief  belief  is  like  there's  an  after 
 school  special  belief  where  the  mom  says 
 believe  in  yourself  and  that's  all  great 
 but  there's  also  a  built  belief  and  the 
 built  belief  is  one  where  you  are 
 constantly  like  for  me  I  came  from  a  bad 
 place  How  I  build  belief  is  through  the 
 the  daunting  tasks  I  put  myself  through 
 so  that's  proof  positive  that  I  can't 
 so  it  correlates  and  that's  how  this 
 piece  of  [ __ ]  kid  I  once  thought  I  was 
 built  belief  by  saying  hm  I  was  in  three 
 hell  weeks  I  went  to  Ranger  school  I 
 tried  out  for  Delta  selection  undeniable 
 stock  of  proof  that  is  proof 
 [ __ ]  so  whenever  you  think 
 whenever  you  think  you  can't  confidence 
 comes  from  the  thing  that  you  built  you 
 must  build  belief  you  must  build 
 confidence  it  can't  be  like  he  um  I'm 
 going  go  knock  that  [ __ ]  out  you  got  to 
 look  over  here  and  say  I  can  knock  that 
 [ __ ]  out  it's  belief  and  it's  built  on 
 what  you  put  in  to  yourself  another 
 friend  sent  me  a  a  message  this  morning 
 knowing  that  we  had  this  this  big  thing 
 that  we've  working  toward  for  a  long 
 time  today  he  said  uh  nature  said  I  know 
 of  no  better  life  purpose  than  to  perish 
 in  attempting  the  great  and  impossible 
 the  fact  that  something  seems  impossible 
 shouldn't  be  a  reason  to  not  pursue  it 
 that's  exactly  what  makes  it  worth 
 pursuing  where  would  the  courage  and 
 greatness  be  if  success  was  certain  and 
 there  was  no  risk  the  only  true  failure 
 is  shrinking  away  from  life's  challenges 
 na  that  one  also  two  for  two  na  that  one 
 also  man  yeah  it's  that  um  it's  that 
 dealing  with  laziness  and  self-doubt 
 thing  I  think 
 uh  and  I  do  wonder  how  many  people  use 
 the  look  in  the  mirror  pound  the  chest 
 stare  into  your  eyes  say  your 
 affirmations  don't  get  the  results  and 
 then  lose 
 confidence  well  that's  part  of  it  a  lot 
 of  it  is  limit  to 
 Horizons  limited  Horizons  are  like  I  use 
 me  as  an  example 
 always  I  came  from  a  small  town  in 
 Indiana  where  there  was  a  handful  of 
 black 
 families  and  a  lot  of  people  in  that 
 town  when  you  come  from  a  town  of  8,000 
 people  it's  like  we  had  a  local  plant 
 Great  Dane  you're  like  you  know  what  I 
 want  to  work  at  Great  Dane  and  get  a 
 house  next  to  my  mom  that's  what  you 
 know  so  many  of  us  come  from  these  small 
 places  in  our  mind  that  we're  not 
 willing  to  think  outside  of  only  what 
 we've  seen  our  mind  works  in  such  a 
 small 
 compartment  and  one  thing  I  was  able  to 
 do  was  to  dream  many  people  but  don't 
 make  dreams  your  [ __ ]  m 
 Master  but  I  was  able  to  dream  outside 
 those  [ __ ]  Four  Walls  of  that  small 
 town  and  until  you're  able  to  really  put 
 yourself  into  that  dream  but  don't  make 
 dreams  your  master  that's  where  you 
 truly  become  what  you're  destined  to 
 become  what  you  mean  don't  make  dreams 
 your  master  a  lot  of  people  sit  back  and 
 they  dream  about  being  a  sports  figure 
 or  dream  about  being  a  seal  or  dream 
 about  being  an  astronaut  all  it  is  is  a 
 [ __ ]  dream  they  don't  put  the 
 work  behind  the  dream  that  dream  has 
 become  their  [ __ ]  Master  when  you 
 become  the  master  of  your  [ __ ]  dream 
 is  when  you  say  I  want  to  go  be  a  Navy 
 SEAL  and  you  say  okay  I'm  gonna  lose  106 
 pounds  and  less  than  three  [ __ ] 
 months  the  dream  was  the  one  thing  I 
 thought  about  and  the  dream  was  now  gone 
 now  what  comes  in  the  dream  goes  away 
 and  the  [ __ ]  laundry  list  of  [ __ ] 
 details  and  tasks  come  up  got  do  this 
 gotta  do  this  gotta  do  this  gotta  do 
 this  that's  when  you  become  the  master 
 of  your  dream  so  a  lot  of  people  out 
 there  dreaming  Ryan  holiday  says  talking 
 about  the  thing  and  doing  the  thing  V 
 for  the  same  resources  allocate  yours 
 appropriately  that's  it  that's  it  that's 
 the  way  it  works  as  well  that's  the  way 
 that  the  brain  works  you  can  actually 
 get  these  kicks  of  dopamine  by  telling 
 your  friends  about  I'm  going  to  be  a 
 Navy  SEAL  I'm  going  to  start  my  training 
 next  week  it's  going  to  be  great  I'm 
 gonna  feel  like  this  feels  good  it  feels 
 good  to  talk  about  that  [ __ ]  man  it 
 actually  makes  you  feel  good  makes  you 
 feel  proud  all  that  [ __ ]  but  guess  what 
 happens  that  alarm  clock  goes  off  at 
 4:00  am.  to 
 train  I  want  to  be  a  seal  today  or  I 
 don't  want  to  be  whatever  today  I'll 
 start  tomorrow  and  that's  the  usual 
 pattern  of  people's  lives  that's  why  I 
 talk  about  clearing  out  the  mind  until 
 you  really  want  to  do  something  you're 
 always  G  to  be  a  talker  you  always  get 
 run  your  [ __ ]  mouth  so  again  with  the 
 audio  version  of  this  book  you've  done 
 podcasts  in  between  each  chapter  where 
 you're  recapping  what's  just  happened 
 and  this  time  you  brought  guests  one  of 
 which  was  your  mother  right  and  you 
 spend  a  35  minute  conversation  sitting 
 down  with  her  and  talking  about  the 
 experiences  that  she  had  with  your 
 father  and  reflecting  on  that  right  a 
 lot  of  stuff  you'd  elected  to  leave  out 
 of  the  first  book  so  that  means  there's 
 been  a  journey  that  you've  gone  through 
 to  get  to  the  stage  where  both  you  and 
 her  and  collaboratively  you  felt  okay 
 sharing  that  publicly  right  like  what's 
 that  process  like  CU  your  mom  didn't  ask 
 for  this  I  mean  you  kind  of  also  did  you 
 put  a  book  out  there  because  you  thought 
 it  was  useful  and  now  millions  and 
 millions  of  people  know  about  you  but 
 right  you  know  the  uh  gravity  field  of 
 your  notoriety  is  starting  to  bring 
 other  people  in  as  well  so  what  was  the 
 Journey  of  getting  to  that  stage  like 
 well  it  wasn't  so  much  me  I  had  already 
 laid  out  you  know  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  about  me 
 that  was  you  know  pretty  embarrassing 
 and  can't  hurt  me  so  for  her  her  that 
 actually  helped  her  out  she  said  wow  if 
 you  had  the  courage  to  go  out  there  and 
 tell  people  all  your  [ __ ]  you  know  and 
 so  that  process  was  it  it  took  about 
 four  years  of  me  working  with  my  mom 
 because  you  know  she  was  very  damaged  by 
 what  she  went  through  and  so  was  I  but  I 
 knew  no  one  was  coming  to  save  me  so  I 
 had  to  go  ahead  and  fix  my  [ __ ]  and  she 
 kind  of  lived  in  a  different  place  but 
 when  I  wrote  can't  hurt  me  it  started 
 waking  her  up 
 that  hey  man  why  do  you  care  why  do  you 
 care  so  much  what  people  think  about  you 
 what  you  went  through  why  why  are  you 
 putting  so  much  so  much  on  other  people 
 and  what  they  may  say  about  you  like 
 there's  some  stuff  I  talk  about  you  know 
 that  is  pretty  embarrassing  for  some 
 people  but  she  got  to  a  point  in  her 
 life  where  she  was  able  to  you  know  stop 
 caring  because  we  all  have  our  [ __ ]  no 
 one  that  like  people  it's  so  funny  to  me 
 there  be  people  who  are  out  here 
 commentating  about  people  who  are 
 [ __ ]  up  out  here  famous  people  are 
 [ __ ]  up  and  I  don't  know  how  they're 
 able  to  do  that  when  I  guarantee  while 
 your  skeletons  are  not  being  out  there 
 if  I  were  to  open  up  your  [ __ ]  door 
 [ __ ]  how  how  how  are  you  doing 
 that  so  I  know  that  about  everybody  like 
 people  love  to  talk  [ __ ]  about  somebody 
 and  keep  themselves  out  of  it  and  so  we 
 went  through  that  journey  together  and 
 so  it  allowed  her  to  come  out  and  say 
 yeah  [ __ ]  it  you  know  I'm  I'm  a  big 
 person  who  I  want  to  get  people  to 
 confidence  to  walk  in  the  room  of  a 
 million  people  and  none  of  them  like  you 
 and  you  just  like  say  [ __ ]  you  I'm  good 
 and  walk  out  with  you  by  yourself  you 
 helped  your  mom  do  that  as  well  and  now 
 she  can  look  at  everybody  and  say  yeah  I 
 [ __ ]  married  a  [ __ ]  that 
 choked  the  woman  to  death  I  was  in  a  bad 
 place  I'm  good  with 
 that  one  of  the  days  that  you  focus  on  a 
 good  bit  in  that  conversation  is  the  day 
 that  she  decided  to  leave  your  father 
 right  and  take  you  and  your  brother  with 
 her  MH  was  there  anything  that  you 
 learned  about  upon  reflection  MH  where 
 both  of  your  experiences  uh  opened  up  a 
 new  realization  to 
 you  that  that  was  a  hard  time  for  her 
 and  for  me  also  I  was  ready  to  leave  a 
 long  time  ago  I  was  just  waiting  for  her 
 to  get  the  courage  to  finally  leave  him 
 and  um 
 I  don't  think  anything  from  that 
 really  I  think  that's  where  the  damage 
 really  began  I  think  for  her  when  she 
 left  it  almost  her 
 fight  went  away  and  it's  kind  of  like 
 when  you  run  100  miles  when  you  sit  down 
 your  body  can  then  say  exactly  what  I 
 was  thinking  I'm  done  exactly  what  I  was 
 thinking  the  second  she 
 left  that  the  Mind  said  oh  my  God 
 like  we  can  we  can  be  human  it's  like 
 PTSD  yes  we  can  be  human  and  we're  not 
 fighting  anymore  and  it  just  swarmed  the 
 demons  that  all  that  fight  and  all  that 
 [ __ ]  was  keeping  away  it  just  came  and 
 it  swallowed  it  swallowed  her  whole  and 
 it  also  swallowed  me  whole  but  once 
 again  like  we're  were  talking  about  I 
 got  a  chance  to  watch 
 her  and  she  set  out  the  ultimate 
 blueprint  on  how  not  to  be 
 so  I  had  a  hard  time  learning  growing  up 
 but  I  was  very  smart  when  it  came  to 
 human  beings  a  genius  because  I  lived  in 
 such  hell  I  was  always  studying  people 
 who  can  I  trust  who  can  I  not  trust 
 energy  I  I  got  really  good  with  energy 
 can  I  is  this  person's  energy  good  is  it 
 bad  so  I  became  a  genius  on  human  beings 
 so  I  studied  people  all  the  time  studied 
 all  the  time  she  also  talks  about 
 considering  taking  her  own  life  oh  yeah 
 were  you  aware  of  that  before  you 
 started  working  toward  this  book  yeah  so 
 yeah  she  she  talked  about  that  a  few 
 times  with  me  you  know  behind  closed 
 doors  and  um  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  surprised 
 she  didn't  you  know  there's  a  lot  of 
 stories  that  are  still  ont  told  that  she 
 probably  will  never  talk  about  and  I'll 
 never  talk  about  them  until  she  says 
 it's  fine  but  um  yeah  it  was  it  was  a 
 bad  it  was  it  was  a  bad  way  so  I  I  I 
 give  her  credit  for  having  the  strength 
 to  say  okay  I  need  to  continue  on  and 
 figure  out  you  know  what's  next  for  me 
 which  she  says  the  only  reason  that  she 
 didn't  go  through  with  it  is  because  of 
 you  and  your  brother  because  she  knew 
 that  she  would  be  leaving  you  in  the 
 hands  of  this  Tyrant  that  was  going  to 
 mistreat  you  even  more  badly  now  that 
 she  wasn't  around  to  protect  you  yeah 
 which  is  a  it's  beautiful  but  it's  also 
 kind  of  a  lot  of  pressure  it  feels  like 
 a  lot  of  pressure  for  a  child  to  be  the 
 reason  for  his  mother  to  to  still  be 
 there  and  it's  also  a  damning  conclusion 
 about  the  state  of  her  life  right  that 
 the  only  thing  stopping  you  from  taking 
 your  own  life  is  these  two  boys  but  it's 
 also  beautiful  in  a  way  because  a  lot  of 
 people  only  have  one 
 thing  you  don't  need  a  lot  of  things 
 sometimes  only  thing  that  kept  me  with 
 that  one  step  forward  was  one  thing  and 
 so  that  one  thing  can  get  you  to  two 
 things  to  three  things  to  four  things  so 
 that  was  the  beautiful  thing  about  that 
 is  that  now  she's  75  and  she's  retired 
 because  of  that  one 
 thing 
 how  I  mean  you  you're  having  this 
 conversation  with  your  mom  during  the 
 production  of  the  audio 
 book  you're  having  a  conversation  which 
 is  difficult  to  have  in  private  right 
 with  two  microphones  in  front  of  you 
 knowing  full  well  that  this  is  going  out 
 to  millions  of  people  it's  going  to  be 
 scrutinized  it's  going  to  be  listened  to 
 it's  going  to  be  reflected  on  Y  how 
 difficult  is  it  to  watch  your  mother 
 opening  up  about  an  experience  which  to 
 you  was  traumatic  and  then  reopening 
 those  wounds  in  front  of  you  and  talking 
 about  that  for  millions  of  people  to 
 hear  oh  it's  it's  hard  it's  hard 
 but  it's 
 necessary  why  to  be  able  to  own  your 
 trauma  to  be  able  to  own  everything 
 about  you  and  look  it  in  the 
 eye  like  there's  a  part  in  Eight  Mile 
 with  Eminem  the  very  end  when  this  white 
 boy  you  know  [ __ ]  trying  to  make  it 
 in  the  rap  world  and  getting  beat  down 
 and  [ __ ]  comes  from  some  trailer  park 
 [ __ ]  and  he's  like  how  the  [ __ ]  am  I  GNA 
 win  this  rap  battle  because  my  best 
 friend  got  shot  in  the  foot  and  this 
 dude  slept  with  my  girl  and  all  this 
 [ __ ]  so  what  he  does  to  take  all  the 
 power  from  the  [ __ ]  gonna  rap 
 battle  his  ass  he's 
 like  I'm  going  to  tell  you  every 
 [ __ ]  thing  about  me  I'm  just 
 going  to  [ __ ]  tell  you  and  that's  how 
 I  feel  about  life  and  that's  how  my  mom 
 now  feels  about  life  I'm  just  gonna 
 [ __ ]  tell  you  everything  a  [ __ ] 
 about  me  I'm  not  gonna  hide  I'm  not 
 gonna  do  none  of  this  [ __ ]  and  it's  a 
 refreshing  feeling  when  you  can  get  in 
 front  of  millions  of  people  get 
 audiobook  and  you  can  go  through  your 
 [ __ ]  and  lay  it  out  and  you  walk  away 
 there's  no  more  secrets  there's  no  more 
 secrets  like  when  people  say  oh  hey 
 Lance  Armstrong  did  you  do  steroids  no 
 no  no 
 yes  while  I  have  nothing  I  have  nothing 
 wrong  with  Lance  Armstrong  or  anybody 
 else  just  [ __ ]  tell  the  [ __ ] 
 man  and  guess  what  happens  to  the 
 conversation  it's  over  it  [ __ ]  ends 
 there's  a  really  telling  Moment  In  the 
 book  I  think  it's  my  favorite  part  and 
 it's  not  even  in  this  one  it's  in  the 
 audio  book  and  it's  when  it's  getting 
 quite  difficult  with  your  mom  mhm  and 
 you  offer  her  a  root  out  you  ask  if  she 
 wants  to  take  a  break  y  she  says  no  I 
 want  to  keep  going  so  it  seems  like 
 she's  got  a  bit  of  that  dog  in  her  as 
 well  oh  yeah  she  had  to  yeah  she  had  to 
 one  one  thing  that  when  you  grow  up  the 
 way  we  kind  of  grew  up  together  that's 
 how  I  look  at  it  when  you  grew  up  when 
 she  had  you  and  she  had  J  28  and  my 
 brother  at  24  so  um  after  that  you  know 
 we  grew  up  together  and  you  got  to  have 
 a  dog  you  you  have  to  have  a  dog  in  you 
 man  and  so  you  have  to  have  like  like  my 
 grandfather  called  it  a  stiff  upper  lip 
 you  better  have  a  stiff  upper  lip  so  you 
 know  yeah  she  has  some  dog  in  her  she 
 has  some  dog  in  her  she  has  to  there's 
 no  other  way  to  make  it  out  here  I  mean 
 you  can't  just  always  be  you  know  head 
 down  in  the  sand  you  gotta  learn  to  pick 
 yourself  up  on  your  own  a  lot  of  times 
 these  fights  and  these  battles  you  got 
 to  be  your  own  [ __ ]  coach  you  got  to 
 be  your  own  motivator  and  she  had  do 
 that  several  times  in  her  life  given  all 
 of  this  trauma  that  you  go  through  why 
 would  you  choose  to  go  back  and  see  this 
 Tyrant  of  a  father  for  one  last  time  it 
 was  the  only  way  for  me  to  move 
 forward  so  like  a  lot  of 
 times  if  your  back  is  hurting  it  may  not 
 be  your  [ __ ]  back  it  may  be  something 
 else  in  your  body  that's  making  your 
 back  hurt  for 
 me  I'm  like  man  why  can't  I  get  past 
 this  [ __ ]  hurdle  so  like  I  said  I'm 
 always  is  examining  myself  every  day 
 what  is  it  what  is  it  well  there's  only 
 one  thing  you  haven't  examined  yet  and 
 it's  going  back  to  the  Beast  going  back 
 to  the  demon  so  when  I  went  back  to  him 
 I  realized  that  that  was  the  unsolved 
 mystery  was  I  had  to  look  that  man  the 
 eye  one  more 
 time  like  how  I  studied  the  that  Navy 
 SEAL  talking  [ __ ]  and  lion  I  got  it  from 
 this  part  right  here  in  the  book  I  went 
 and  I  didn't  see  him  any  any  more  as 
 this 
 Beast  I  started  doing  research  on  him 
 found  out  that  his  dad  used  to  beat  him 
 really  bad  so  my  his  his  dad  would  put 
 him  in  front  of  a 
 furnace  open  the  furnace  up  with  the 
 Flames  coming  out  and  put  him  right  in 
 front  of  it  have  him  bare  but  naked  and 
 he  would  whip  the  [ __ ]  out  of  him  and 
 the  whole  idea  of  that  is  if  you  move 
 you're  going  to  get  burned  so  stay  right 
 here  and  take  your  [ __ ]  beat 
 so  what  happened  with 
 him  those  demons  from  his  father  went  to 
 my  father  and  he  tried  to  transfer  him 
 over  to  me  I  had  to  understand  who  my 
 father  was  understand  where  he  came  from 
 understand  why  were  you  so  [ __ ] 
 brutal  to 
 us  I  got  my  answers  took  those  answers 
 and  made  myself  better  from  the  ansers 
 about  him  and  so  that's  why  it  was 
 necessary  for  me  to  go  back  not  I  was 
 looking  for  an  AP  ology  so  then  maybe  I 
 could  just  go  be  a  loser  and  understand 
 that  you  [ __ ]  me  up  why  would  the 
 apology  make  you  a  loser  it  would  make 
 no  it  would  make  me  feel  Vindicated 
 Justified  yes  like  man  you  you  did  this 
 to  me  I  can  go  be  a  loser  now  my 
 failings  are  okay  this  okay  yep  because 
 you  did  this  so  I  was  looking  for  that 
 and  when  I  went  there  I  I  realized 
 because  his  voice  in  him  was  saying  it's 
 not  your  dad's 
 fault  and  I'm  like  n  a  man  because  this 
 voice  over  here  always  said  it's  your 
 dad's  fault  this  other  voice  started 
 tuning  in  was  loud  started  getting 
 louder  the  more  I  drove  to  Buffalo  was 
 saying  you  got  to  face  a  lot  of  [ __ ] 
 young  man  you  got  a  long  journey  ahead 
 of  you  because  you're  gonna  find  out 
 that  while  your  dad  did  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  to 
 you  you're  gonna  have  to  [ __ ]  make  it 
 on  your  own  and  the  voice  got  louder  and 
 louder  and  louder  and  by  time  I  got  to 
 that  door  and  by  time  I  was  leaving  that 
 house  instead  of  me  feeling  sorry  for 
 myself  I  started  to  doing  live 
 autopsy  because  a  lot  of  people  when  you 
 die  they  figure  out  why  you  died  they 
 figure  out  how  you  died  in  the 
 autopsy  but  we  never  do  live  autopsy  to 
 figure  out  why  we're  dying  while  we  are 
 alive  and  I  was  dying  I  was  living  every 
 day  but  I  was  really  dead  and  so  I 
 figured  it  out  and  once  I  figured  it  out 
 I  was  able  to  reborn  I  was  able  to  be 
 reborn 
 what  we  see  is  this  pattern  of 
 generational  trauma  your  grandfather  to 
 your  father  your  father  to  you  father  to 
 son  just  being  passed  on  passed  on 
 passed  on  is  this  part  of  your  mission 
 to  be  a  circuit  breaker  to  be  a  a  dam  to 
 stop  this  Trauma  from  moving  forward 
 into  the  Next  Generation  100%  but  with 
 people  I'm  trying  to  build  people  up  I'm 
 trying  to  armor  their  mind  I'm  trying  to 
 get  the  the  belief  because  this  world  we 
 live  in  is  tough  it's  tough  it  will  beat 
 you  down  the  world  and  the  life  that  we 
 live  in  is  the  ultimate  competitor  it 
 will  try  to  take  you  out  it  will  it  will 
 find  your 
 weakness  and  it  will  [ __ ]  just  Hammer 
 you  it's  like  a  personal  curse  100%  so 
 if  I  can  help  you  build  belief  build 
 confidence  to  the  point 
 where  nothing  can  hurt  you  because  you 
 know  exactly  who  you  are  you've  faced 
 your  demons  you've  you've  been  able  to 
 go  on  an  audio  book  in  your  mind  maybe 
 you  didn't  write  a  book  but  in  your  mind 
 you  were  able  to  hear  all  your  past 
 traumas  you  were  able  to  listen  to  them 
 you're  able  to  [ __ ]  say  okay  now  I 
 can  now  talk  to  people  about  what  I  went 
 through  I'm  no  longer  embarrassed  I'm  no 
 longer  ashamed  being  ashamed  is  one  of 
 the  biggest  things  that  kill  people 
 nowadays  in  their  minds  kill  them  from 
 moving  forward  I'm  ashamed  of 
 myself  don't  ever  be  ashamed  of  anything 
 you've  done  in  your  life  face  it  fix  it 
 make  it 
 better  we  are 
 humans  but  then  again  if  you  always 
 think  that  we're  humans  you  will  always 
 just  be  a  human  and  always  make  the  same 
 [ __ ] 
 mistakes  you  must  take  this  knowledge 
 that  you  learn  from  all  this  [ __ ]  is 
 knowledge  so  I'm  just  trying  to  give 
 people  that  strength  to  go  in  the 
 archives  of  your  life  because  while 
 you're  probably  [ __ ]  up  it's  probably 
 something  happened  to  you  in  your  life 
 go  through  the  archives  dig  it  up 
 study  it  and  then  use  it  for  yourself 
 that's  that's  the  main  purpose  for  me 
 right  now  have  you  considered  what  you 
 would  be  like  as  a 
 father  yeah  I  actually  have  a  daughter 
 right 
 now  yeah  no  way  I  didn't  know  yeah  I 
 have  a  daughter  right  now  but  that  being 
 said  I'm  an  open  honest  person  when  you 
 meet  people  at  a  young  age  so  I  had  a 
 kid  at  a  young  age  when  I  was  in  the 
 worst  possible  place  in  my  life 
 so  when  you're  in  a  bad  place  you're  not 
 going  to  meet  a 
 Kish  you're  going  to  meet  a  person 
 that's  very  similar  to  who  you  are  at 
 that  time  and  then  you  bring  a  child 
 into  this  world  and  as  you  start  to  move 
 up  in  this  world  and  get  better  and  you 
 realize  I  need  to  get  better  you  try  to 
 pull  that  person  along  with  you  a  lot  of 
 times  they  don't  want  to  come  where 
 you're  going  and  it  creates  a  bad 
 environment 
 so  that's  where  that  is  right 
 now  talking  but  my  daughter's  21  years 
 old  though  wow  yeah  I'm  glad  to  hear 
 that  I  think  I  I  think  that  uh  it  would 
 be  all  of  the  learnings  and  stuff  that 
 you've  been  through  as  a  father  as  a  son 
 as  a  grandson  um  it  makes  sense  to  me 
 that  that  would  have  been  a  something 
 that  could  have  been  passed  down  mhm  so 
 thinking  about  uh  trauma  and  stuff  that 
 you  go  through  in  your  past  um 
 throughout  most  of  school  for  me  I  was 
 pretty  isolated  only  child  uh  pretty 
 unpopular  in  school  and  the  main  issue 
 that  I  had 
 was  it  wasn't  bullying  it  was  isolation 
 I  think  it  was  being  lonely  right  um  and 
 that  was  primarily  what  was  causing  me 
 to  be  sad  throughout  school  right  so  I 
 do  this  interview  for  the  BBC  about  six 
 months  ago  and  uh  in  it  I  talk  about  I 
 haven't  opened  up  that  much  about 
 bullying  I  I  need  to  to  do  it  more  and 
 it  is  you  know  even  from  watching  you  go 
 through  opening  up  about  your  traumas  it 
 is  inspiring  uh  so  I  do  this  interview 
 for  the  BBC  and  I  mention  a  little  bit 
 about  bullying  in  school  and  so  why 
 don't  you  mention 
 it  I  haven't  got  around  to  it  yet  I  I 
 maybe  still  feel  like 
 it  detracts  from  the  man  that  I  want  to 
 be  the  masculine  man  the  um  respected 
 podcaster  that  it  somehow  undermines  me 
 as  a  person  that  it  makes  me  weaker 
 which  is  obviously  what  was  you  know 
 part  of  the  bullying's  purpose  in  school 
 to  be  able  to  do  precisely  that  right  so 
 I  do  this  interview  for  the  BBC  and  I 
 mentioned  in  two  paragraphs  or  something 
 but  millions  of  people  see  this  article 
 uh  and  I  get  back  one  day  and  in  my 
 Instagram  message  requests  is  this 
 message  from  a  guy  and  I  kind  of 
 recognize  his  name  but  not  not  fully  and 
 I  don't  know  whether  you  know  but 
 there's  like  a  character  limit  in 
 Instagram  so  and  this  is  five  character 
 limit  messages  long  with  multiple 
 paragraphs  within  each  of  them  right  so 
 I  open  it  up  uh  and  this  guy  says  uh  hi 
 Chris  you  might  not  remember  me  but  we 
 went  to  school  together  uh  I  bullied 
 you  my  daughter  is  four  and  she's  about 
 to  go  to  school  and  given  that  she's 
 about  to  go  to  school  me  and  my  wife 
 have  been  discussing  about  the  kind  of 
 child  that  we  want  her  to  be  and  that 
 caused  me  to  reflect  on  my  time  that  I 
 spent  in 
 school  I  saw  I've  been  thinking  about 
 messaging  you  for  a  while  I've  been 
 considering  talking  to  you  uh  because  I 
 really  felt  like  I  needed  to  because  I 
 felt  ashamed  of  the  way  that  I  treated 
 you  in  school  and  I  knew  that  it  had 
 hurt  you  uh  and  then  I  saw  this  article 
 from  the  BBC  and  I  just  had  to  reach  out 
 and  I've  been  sleepless  nights  speaking 
 to  the  wife  tears  and  all  the  rest  of  it 
 uh  and  I  just  wanted  to  say  that  I'm 
 sorry  uh  I'm  very  sorry  for  what  I  did 
 um  I  wanted  to  let  you  know  that  my 
 daughter 
 is  going  to  be  raised  in  a  way  that  will 
 never  treat  anybody  like  that  again  um  I 
 don't  expect  you  to  forgive  me  I  don't 
 even  know  if  you'll  see  this  message  I'm 
 happy  to  see  that  you  seem  to  be  happy 
 um  but  I  I  needed  to  get  it  off  my  chest 
 right  I'm  like  [ __ ]  totally  taken  a  back 
 like  wasn't  prepared  for  this  I  have 
 come  back  in  from  the  gym  or  something 
 and  I'm  sat  reading  this  message  like 
 [ __ ]  hell  that's  heavy  so  I  go  back 
 through  and  I  think  well  how  do  I  feel 
 about  this  how  do  I  feel  about  this 
 person  how  do  I  feel  about  my  experience 
 right  um  because  it  was  so  formative 
 right  it  shaped  so  much  of  the  way  that 
 I  see  myself  the  way  that  I  see  the 
 world  I  had  to 
 deprogram  so  much  of  the  patterns  that 
 I'd  learned  right  through  that  time  um 
 my  desire  for  validation  from  other 
 people  right  U  my  need  to  be  liked  my 
 constant  vigilance  my  ambient  anxiety 
 that  was  always  looking  for  what  was 
 going  on  my  concern  of  being  left  out  y 
 my  adamant  uh  that  everybody  was  um  able 
 to  judge  something  about  me  that  I 
 didn't  know  about  myself 
 y  but  this  guy  had  like  fully  fully 
 opened  up  to  me  and  I  thought  well  you 
 know  it  was  beautiful  it  was  a  beautiful 
 message  um  so  I  replied  to  him  and  I 
 said  hey  man  um  I  very  much  appreciate 
 you  reaching  out  I  think  it's  an 
 incredibly  Brave  thing  to  do  and 
 if  me  going  through  what  I  went  through 
 and  then  the  pain  and  discomfort  and 
 such  and  your  subsequent  suffering  of 
 reflecting  on  what  you  did  MH  if  that 
 has  led  to  a  world  in  which  your 
 daughter  will  be  the  sort  of  person  who 
 will  behave  in  a  manner  that's  going  to 
 make  the  world  a  better  place  going 
 forward  I  think  that's  a  price  that's 
 worth  paying  that's  awesome  man  that's 
 that's  a  great  story  that's  a  great 
 story  and  you're  the  you're  the  expert 
 on  it 
 that's  why  you  should  talk  about 
 bullying  I  know  yeah  you're  the  expert 
 and  that's  why  I  do  it  you  know  um 
 that's  why  I  become  I  i'  I've  become  so 
 vulnerable  because  all  that  knowledge 
 you  gain  because  now  you  are 
 successful  and  there's  so  many  people 
 who  are  getting  bullied  in  so  many 
 ways  that  you  know  you  just  show  them 
 that  there's  a  path  but  the  path  is 
 really  like  I  talk  about  studying  the 
 the 
 bully  that's  the  path  studying  the  bully 
 were  you  ever  tempted  to  become  a  bully 
 never  never  I'm  always  like  I  said  like 
 I  told  you  before  this  started  I  wanted 
 to  be  a  priest  I  want  to  be  a  priest  you 
 know  and  um  could  you  imagine  one  of 
 those  sermons  oh  it'd  be  sick  because  I 
 because  I  would  cuss  because  I  would  I 
 would  definitely  cuss  praise  the  Lord 
 [ __ ]  that's  it  I  would 
 definitely  cuss  I  would  definitely  cuss 
 man  because  that's  that's  the  world  and 
 there's  a  lot  of  people  hear  this  like 
 oh  my  God  that's  this  is  oh  my  God  let 
 me  close  my  ear  you  know  this  the 
 world's 
 tough  the  world's  tough  and  when  you 
 come  up  the  way  I  came  up  the  only  way  I 
 can  [ __ ]  describe  something  sometimes 
 to  say  [ __ ]  a  [ __ ]  because 
 that's  how  dark  this  [ __ ] 
 was  and  I  can't  make  it  flowery  I  can't 
 make  it  PG  like  oh  I  want  my  kids  to 
 like  I  have  a  clean  edition  of  this  book 
 have  oh  you  have  a  non-explicit  version 
 yes  because  people  like  I  want  my  I  want 
 my  kid  to  read  your  book  but  you  but  you 
 cuss  so  much  I  can't  I  imagine  it's 
 about  half  the  size  yes  it's  very  small 
 yes  so  so  the  funny  thing  about  it  is 
 like  how  long  are  you  going  to  shelter 
 your  child  from  a  world  that's  evil  as 
 [ __ ]  that's  going  to  come  at  you  it's 
 going  to  come  at  you  whether  you've  been 
 bullied  or  not  there's  going  to  come  a 
 time 
 when  it's  going  to  come  at  you  and  it's 
 G  to  be  a  lot  worse  than  [ __ ]  or 
 [ __ ]  it's  G  to  be  a  lot  worse  and 
 so  we  are  training  kids  and  people  to  be 
 soft  in  a  world  that  continuously  gets 
 harder  and  it  doesn't  it  doesn't 
 correlate  like  that  guy  talking  about 
 the  tear  gas  with  the  seals  is  that 
 necessary  I  don't  know  but  what  is 
 necessary  is  you  have  to  build  a  person 
 that  can  withstand  the  pressures  of 
 whatever  they're  going  to  be  dealing 
 with  in 
 life  and  we  don't  do  that  I'm  not  trying 
 to  send  a  message  of  run  200  miles  be 
 the  bad  [ __ ]  in  the  world  but  be 
 tough  you  better  have  a  part  about  you 
 that's  tough  a  part  about  you  that  can 
 break  down  situations  and  get  better  and 
 break  down  situations  very  quickly 
 within  some  trauma  in  your  life  some 
 Devastation  in  your  life  because  it's 
 going  to  come  the  devastation  the  trauma 
 is  going  to  come  and  you  can't  allow 
 that  to  become  a  jersey  barrier  it  can't 
 be  a  jersey  barrier  it  has  to  be 
 something  that  you  can  maneuver  through 
 very  quickly  and  move  forward  that  takes 
 a  lot  of  toughness  well  unchosen 
 suffering  is  going  to  happen  right  so 
 the  only  thing  that  you  can  do  is  have 
 some  chosen  suffering  to  prepare  for  it 
 it's  the  only  thing  you  can  do  that's 
 the  only  thing  you  can  practice  for  the 
 unchosen  suffering  is  have  chosen 
 suffering  do  something  that's  sucks 
 every  day  I  had  hubman  on  the  show  a  few 
 months  ago  and  he  told  me  about  bringing 
 you  into  his  lab  and  putting  you  in  VR 
 underwater  with  sharks  right  give  me 
 your  experience  with  huberman  he's  great 
 he  he  knows  his  stuff  he  knows  his  stuff 
 um  yeah  he's  just  a  he's  a  very 
 knowledgeable  man  on  what  he's  doing 
 what's  being  in  VR  with  sharks  like  it's 
 nothing  no  no  no  because  one  thing  about 
 me  is  I  deal  in 
 reality  you  put  me  in  VR  as  VR  it's  a 
 fake  thing  and  I  work  in  reality  I  only 
 work  in  reality  I  don't  work  in  fake 
 situations  so  that's  why  it  didn't  work 
 on  me  you  put  me  in  a  real  ocean  with 
 real  sharks  you'll  get  your  real 
 reaction  you  put  me  in  a  room  that  I 
 when  you  walk  in  the 
 door  and  you  sit  down  in  the  chair  and 
 you  put  some  [ __ ]  on  your  [ __ ]  face  I 
 know  I'm  in  a  [ __ ]  chair  I  know  I'm 
 in  a  room  if  you  get  that  psyched  the 
 [ __ ]  out  you  need  to  study  that  more 
 than  that  you  know  what  I'm  saying  yeah 
 why  are  you  so  sensitive  why  you  so  if 
 you  are  on  a  high  wire  because  you're 
 afraid  of  heights  but  you're  sitting 
 firmly  on  the  [ __ ]  ground  you  need  to 
 study  the  fact  that  you're  doing 
 something  wrong  don't  study  the  freight 
 of  heights  study  why  the  [ __ ]  do  I  know 
 I'm  on  the  [ __ ]  ground  in  a  [ __ ] 
 chair  but  I'm  afraid  of  what's  on  this 
 screen  so  I  don't  allow  anything  to  go 
 beyond  the  truth  he  said  that  um 
 obviously  you  didn't  know  this  in 
 advance  it  could  have  been  the  most 
 lifelike  VR  in  the  history  of  the  world 
 and  apparently  it  was  a  group  of  you 
 guys  and  someone  had  to  go  first  someone 
 had  to  go  first  you're  not  that  good 
 with  water  not  sure  how  you  feel  about 
 sharks  but  can't  imagine  you're  a  fan 
 um  and  you  would  just  like 
 me  me  please  I'm  first  yeah  I'm  like 
 that  with 
 everything  because  why  I  sit  back  in  the 
 back  and  think  about  let  me  watch  you  go 
 first  you  can  watch  me  go  first  is  there 
 anything  that  you'd  like  to  study  with 
 huberman  would  there  be  any  like  cool 
 tests  is  there  anything  that  you've  been 
 thinking  about  to  do  with  performance  or 
 anything  like  that  at  the  moment  no 
 you've  just  got  your  own  mental  lab 
 you're  doing  everything  lab  every 
 everything  I  need  is  in  my  mental  lab 
 everything  because  I'm  in  constant  study 
 of 
 myself  that's  and  I  know  what  needs  to 
 be  conquered  because  I'm  constantly 
 going  through  what  I  don't  like  what  I'm 
 not  comfortable  with  you  know  like  I'm  I 
 know  and  only  I  can  fix  these  problems 
 because  I  have  to  face  these  problems  so 
 I  have  a  rolling  a  rolling  log  on  what 
 needs  to  happen  so  I'm  I'm  really  good 
 about  being  accountable  about  okay  you 
 need  to  be  better  here  you  need  be 
 better  here  you  need  to  overcome  this 
 overcome  that  and  I  do  a  good  job  of 
 doing  that  you  talk  about  performance 
 without  a  purpose  M  what's 
 that  so  like  for  instance  let's  say  you 
 have  no  races  let's  say  you  have  no 
 classes  no  nothing  you  have  there's  no 
 purpose  in  your  life  you  know  people 
 need  to  have  purpose  to  get  up  they  need 
 purpose  to 
 perform  you  need  to  get  to  a  point  in 
 your  life  where  there's  nothing  on  the 
 docket  there's  no  5K  there's  no  there's 
 no  um  I'm  going  to  get  into  school  to  be 
 this  or  that  and  still  perform  to  the 
 highest  level  because  what  people  don't 
 get  is  one  day  that  thing's  going  to 
 come  up  and  if  you're  not  constantly 
 performing  without  purpose  you're  not 
 going  to  be  ready  when  the  time 
 comes  it's  this  magical  thing  purpose 
 that  we're  all  looking  for  but  what's 
 funny  about  it  all  is  that  we  need  these 
 things  to  perform 
 but  we  don't  take  a  second  to  realize 
 the  purpose  is  always  there  the  purpose 
 never  leaves  us  because  the  very  purpose 
 is  you  you  are  always  the  purpose  there 
 may  be  another  purpose  like  being  a  seal 
 or  going  to  college  or  whatever  but  the 
 main  purpose  in  life  is  you  so  if  you 
 wake  up  in  the  morning  and  you  don't 
 want  to  do 
 something  you  don't  care  enough  about 
 yourself  and  that's  what  you  need  to 
 really  research  is  man  why  am  I  not 
 doing  this  for  myself  because  that  is 
 that  is  the  number  one  purpose  in  life 
 is  to  better 
 oneself  so  that's  the  only  purpose  I 
 [ __ ]  need  so  the  reason  I  get  up 
 every  day  even  though  there's  no  race  or 
 there's  no  school  there's  nothing  in 
 front  of  me  is  because  I  have  pride  in 
 myself  but  where  do  you  go  to  you  wake 
 up  on  the  morning  it's  cold  it's  wet 
 it's  dark  you've  got  no  cartilage  in 
 your  knee  you've  got  shitty  shorts 
 whatever  it  is  that's  the  issue  today 
 keep 
 talking  you've  got  these  problems  right 
 I  need  you  to  keep  talking  about  what 
 you  were  just  saying  it's  warm  on  the 
 couch  your  M  say  stay  in  bed  it's  comfy 
 it's  cozy  you've  got  work  later  on  you 
 had  an  argument  last  night  you're 
 slightly  hung  over  because  I  know  every 
 [ __ ]  ain't  gonna  do  what  I'm 
 gonna  do  so  this  is  how  you  level  up 
 that's  how  you  level  up  I  know  there's  a 
 whole  bunch  of  people  with  that  right 
 there  that  fires  me  up  that  makes  me 
 [ __ ]  happy  what  you  just  said  that 
 brings  joy  to  my  life  right  there  why 
 because  I  know  there's  so  many  people 
 that  have  the  ability  and  just  refuse  to 
 get  off  that  couch  refuse  to  study  a  few 
 more  hours  refuse  to  go  deeper  to  go 
 further  and  that's  where  I  gained  the 
 advantage  it's  so  easy  to  be  great 
 nowadays  my  friend  because  most  people 
 are  weak  most  people  don't  want  to  go  to 
 that  extra  mile  most  people  don't  want 
 to  find  that  extra  cuz  it  sucks  it's 
 miserable  it's  lonely  you  talk  about 
 that  you  were  kind  of  you  know  Lonely  by 
 yourself  I  was  the  same  way  and  that 
 used  to  hurt  me  growing  up  now  I  [ __ ] 
 thrive  in  that  [ __ ]  that's  the  only 
 place  to  be  well  that  was  one  of  the 
 things  that  is  so  surprising  about 
 growing  up  through  difficulty  you  know 
 so  loneliness  is  one  example  right 
 growing  up  as  a  lonely  kid  what  you 
 realize  is  lot  of  the  things  that  you 
 feared  or  hated  or  embarrassed  about  as 
 a  child  end  up  being  the  Genesis  of  the 
 things  that  you're  most  proud  about  as 
 an  adult  so  the  fact  that  you  can  work 
 and  thrive  in  solitude  gives  you  the 
 opportunity  to  be  able  to  move  to 
 America  and  start  a  podcast  or  decide  to 
 do  hell  week  three  times  in  a  row  or  it 
 doesn't  matter  how  long  or  dark  the 
 course  is  you're  just  going  to  stay  MH 
 the  fact  that  you  were  uh  forced  to  be 
 VI 
 and  to  assess  people  to  work  out  what's 
 going  on  when  you  became  an  adult  allows 
 you  to  detect  the  vibe  and  the  energy  of 
 whoever  it  is  that  you're  speaking  with 
 and  know  that  this  person  is  someone 
 that  I  want  to  hang  with  and  this 
 person's  somebody  that  I  don't  right  all 
 of  the  things  in  fact  I  would  go  as  far 
 as  to  say  there's  not  one  thing  in  my 
 life  that  I  see  as  a  pure  advantage  that 
 doesn't  have  a  dark  side  to  it  that  came 
 about  at  some  other  point  as  well  right 
 so  one  of  the  reasons  that  I  spent  so 
 much  time  as  a  kid  in  my  bedroom 
 listening  to  audio  tapes  because  I 
 didn't  have  anyone  to  play  with  right 
 only  child  little  bit  sort  of  unpopular 
 right  so  I'd  be  in  my  bedroom  listening 
 to  audio  tapes  and  we  go  to  the  library 
 every  two  weeks  and  we'd  take  the  tapes 
 back  and  we  get  new  tapes  and  i'  bring 
 them  and  listen  to  them  again  right  but 
 you  roll  the  clock  forward  20  years  and 
 what's  the  2023  version  of  an  audio  tape 
 it's  a  podcast  it's  a  podcast  that's 
 right  A  lot  of  the  things  that  you  love 
 and  value  in  yourself  in  adulthood  are 
 the  light  side  of  something  that  you 
 were  ashamed  fearful  disgusted  by  when 
 you  were  younger  yeah  I  mean  I  think 
 that  comes  from 
 overcoming  a  lot  of  people  you  know 
 wonder  how  did  you  become  this  how  you 
 become  so  vulnerable  how  you  how  are  you 
 doing  a  podcast  now  when  you  were  this 
 kid  you  overcame  things  you  fought  them 
 and  now  this  is  what  happens  this  is  on 
 the  other  side  of 
 overcoming  it  Bec  you  become  very  very 
 powerful  when  you  overcome  yourself  all 
 those  things  you  once  cowed  from  you 
 were  afraid  of  when  you  face  him  eye  to 
 eye  every  day  you  now  become  a  person 
 who  has  a  great 
 podcast  let's  say  that  there's  someone 
 listening  who  resonates  with  what  you're 
 talking  about  you  know  they've  been 
 through  trauma  they've  been  through  hard 
 times  but  they  keep  breaking  promises  to 
 themselves  and  they're  struggling  to  get 
 off  the  couch  and  they're  having  a  pity 
 party  MH  how  can  they  stop  feeling  sorry 
 for  themselves 
 that's  a  difficult 
 one  because  you  have  to  want  it  you  have 
 to  want  to  be  better  and  it  starts  off 
 with  you  have  to  have  pride  in 
 yourself  you  you  have  to  have  pride  in 
 yourself  you  have  to  have  there's 
 something  about  you  whether  it's  your 
 last  name  whether  it's  just  the  smallest 
 thing  you  have  to  be  proud  of  yourself 
 and  if  you  have  no  pride  in  yourself  I 
 can't  give  it  to  you  because  you're 
 always  going  to  compromise  you're  fold 
 always  I'm  very  proud  of  myself  that's 
 why  when  people  said  you  no  way  you  can 
 do  better  than  can't  hurt 
 me  Roger  that  we'll  [ __ ]  see  it's 
 that  Pride  that  wakes  you  up  now  I'm  not 
 talking  about  bad 
 Pride  I  I'm  the  attention  to  detail  for 
 the  human  being  I  want  to  do  I  call  this 
 thing  like  I  want  to  be  the  standard  I 
 want  to  be  that  guy  like  every  place  I 
 went  in  the  military  there  was  this 
 ethos 
 about  how  this  place  is  how  we're  going 
 to  live  how  we're  going  to  represent 
 ourselves  and  I  walked  around  and  I  saw 
 that  most  people  didn't  live  up  to  that 
 ethos  like  if  you  go  to  whatever 
 whatever  company  they  they  had  this 
 mission  statement  on  how  we  want  to  run 
 our 
 company  I  made  one  for 
 myself  on  how  I  want  to  be  and  that  is 
 why  if  people  can  make  up  a  mission 
 statement  an  ethos  and  which  they  want 
 to  live  by  and  every  morning  you  wake  up 
 you  hold  yourself  accountable  to  that 
 mission  not  a  company  is  your  own  make 
 up  your  own  mission  statement  what  do 
 you  want  to  be  in  life  and  once  you  do 
 that  now  you  can  work  with  somebody  to 
 get  better  you  can  work  with  yourself  to 
 get  better  but  until  you  know  what  you 
 want  to  stand  for  you  will  always  just 
 be  sitting  down  you'll  never  stand  for 
 anything  what's  that  quote  if  you  don't 
 stand  for  uh  something  you'll  fall  for 
 everything  that's  it  it's  a  true 
 statement  in  the  book  you  talk  about  uh 
 Roger  that  there  being  two  types  of 
 Roger  that  I  absolutely  adore  the  second 
 type  uh  received  orders  given  expect 
 results  that's  it  that's  it  so  cool 
 above  and  beyond  more  than  was  expected 
 to  the  letter  that's  Roger  that  that  is 
 for  me  what  Roger  that  means  received 
 orders  given  yep  expect  results  expect 
 results  that's  right  so  [ __ ]  dope 
 that  is  it  that  is  it  and  when  you  hear 
 that  from  somebody  who  gets  it  you  know 
 it  because  you  can  look  in  their  eyes 
 you  feel  that  energy  man  it  connects 
 immediately  they're  out  here  to  get  a 
 job  done  Roger 
 that 
 so  the  start  of  the  book  or  at  least  the 
 start  of  the  audio  book  you've  got  a  few 
 different  intros  right  uh  Rogan  yep  your 
 mom  mhm  M  and  The  Rock  right  uh  slightly 
 odd  trifactor 
 but  I  do  think  it  works  so  obviously 
 your  time  Rogan's  had  you  on  now  the 
 third  time  that  you've  been  on  what  have 
 you  learned  since  being  friends  with  him 
 he's  a  very  singular  individual  you  know 
 what  one  thing  about  him  is  that  he's 
 made  it  and  he's  all  about  everybody 
 else  making 
 it  there's  one  thing  that  he  believes  in 
 is  that  there's  enough  food  enough  cake 
 for  everybody  out  here  to  eat  so  there's 
 a  lot  of  people  in  this  world  who  don't 
 want  to  see  you  make  it  because  they 
 think  you  could  take  a  piece  of  their 
 pie  that  motherfucker's  like  look  dude 
 pie  for  everybody  I  got  14  pies  bro  one 
 for  every  [ __ ]  here  and  so  he's 
 all  about  people  making  it  and  that's 
 something  that  a  lot  of  us  can  you  know 
 learn  from  that  people  think  oh  I  made 
 it  I'm  gonna  hold  on  to  it  I'm  not  g  to 
 help  anybody  else  out  the  thing  is  I 
 don't  even  know  if  he  was  uh  something 
 tells  me  he  had  that  philosophy  before 
 he'd  even  made  it  yeah  as  he  was  on  the 
 come  up  yeah  I  mean  I  really  didn't  know 
 him  that  much  back  then  but  um  the  he 
 really  is  to 
 me  the  Oprah  of  the  modern  day  he's  the 
 Oprah  of  the  modern  day  you  know  that 
 that  guy  just  has  made  so  many  people 
 known  to  the  world  gotten  so  many 
 messages  out  so  yeah  I  said  uh  I  was 
 talking  to  Andrew  Schultz  about  the  same 
 thing  and  he  said  very  similar  sentiment 
 especially  he's  coming  from  a  comedy  uh 
 angle  right  and  if  you're  going  to  be 
 championed  in  comedy  it's  super  super 
 difficult  right  and  what  he  what  he  said 
 was  that  uh  the  comedy  world  is  so  zeros 
 some  like  your  gig  is  not  my  gig  and  the 
 fact  that  you  can  have  someone  that  just 
 gives  that  gift  out  is  very  rare  another 
 friend  his  wife  does  iic  medicine  so 
 it's  I'm  not  really  too  sure  what  it  is 
 but  she  did  something  to  do  with  like 
 tarot  card  reading  okay  and  he  asked  her 
 he  was  about  to  go  on  Rogan's  podcast  so 
 he  asked  her  to  do  the  tarot  card 
 readings  about  Joel  because  it  might 
 give  him  a  little  bit  more  insight  or  it 
 would  just  be  interesting  in  general  and 
 the  tarot  card  that  she  pulls  out  might 
 not  be  tarot  it  be  something  similar  the 
 card  that  she  pulled  out  was  um  a  older 
 Warrior  cross-legged  sat  under  a  tree 
 with  his  hands  like  that  this  guy  did 
 he's  got  a  weapon  down  next  to  him 
 weapons  laid  down  transcended  the  battle 
 and  I  was  like  holy  [ __ ]  I'm  I'm  not  too 
 sure  I'm  not  too  sure  about  what's  going 
 on  with  this  tarot  card  reading  thing 
 but  that  one  seems  pretty  accurate  it's 
 probably  perfect  for  him  yeah  yeah  yeah 
 there's  something  about 
 um  raising  other  people  up  as  you  go 
 along  oh  yeah  that  you  know  as  you  get  a 
 platform  as  you  have  the  opportunity  to 
 expose  other  people  that  are  almost  all 
 of  your  time  as  a  podcaster  is  slip 
 streaming  other  people  who  have  bigger 
 platforms  and  then  after  a  while  you  get 
 to  the  stage  where  you  can  be  that 
 springboard  for  others  right  some 
 unbelievably  talented  person  that  nobody 
 knows  about  true  statement  there  you  go 
 now  the  world  can  know  about  you  he's 
 done  the  best  at  that  he's  the  best  at 
 that  what  about  the  rock  if  you  Haven 
 met  him  you  ever  trained  with  him  never 
 never  we  just 
 dm'd  and  I  was  like  I'm  GNA  give  you  a 
 shot  in  the  dark  you  know  the  guy 
 follows  me  he  knows  about  me  whatever  I 
 was  like  this  guy's  so  big  man  he  ain't 
 G  [ __ ]  it  so  I  D  in  man  within  like  20 
 minutes  hey  man  what's  up  brother  sends 
 me  a  voice  message  in  DM  been  following 
 your  work  man  love  what  you  [ __ ]  do 
 blah  blah  blah  blah  blah  oh  yeah  no 
 problem  man  I'll  I'll  hook  you  up  I'll 
 be  more  than  honor  to  hook  you  up  and  in 
 the  audio  book  what  people  don't  know  is 
 I  left  him  alone  I  was  like  hey  man 
 thank  you  I  appreciate  it  I  want  to 
 bother  you  go  back  to  doing  the  great 
 work  that  you  do  you're  so  busy  so  I  was 
 doing  the  audio  book  he  was  like  Hey 
 brother  you  want  me  to  um  you  know  read 
 what  I  wrote  for  you  for  the  Audi  book 
 and  I  was  like 
 yeah  that's  great  that's  how  the  idea 
 came  about  it  was  actually  The  Rock's 
 idea  for  him  to  do  the  blurb  so  then  I 
 got  Joe  Rogan  and  I  got  my  mom  to  read 
 the  blurs  so  that  came  from  him  I  wasn't 
 G  to  put  the  blurbs  in  the  audio  book 
 but  he  was  like  hey  man  I  got  a  studio 
 right  here  I'll  blast  it  out  send  it 
 over  to  you  and  we'll  get  it  done  that's 
 a  training  session  that  the  world  wants 
 to 
 see  I  believe  so  I  believe  so 
 that  should  be  part  of  the  book  tour 
 should  be  a  training  a  training  session 
 between  you  guys  talk  me  through  what 
 the  next  phase  of  your  life  has  in  store 
 um  so  after  this  podcast  I  probably 
 won't  do  another  one  for  a  very  long 
 time  and  I  did  my  book  came  out  on  the 
 6th  it's  now  the  16th  I  did  my  10  days 
 of  the  book  and  now  it's  done  and  now 
 it's  going  back  to  the  lab  so  now  I  go 
 back  go  back  to  firefighting  go  back  to 
 finding  another  level  of  David  gogins 
 and  that's 
 done  in  quiet  areas  and  finding  more  of 
 myself  finding  these  these  spaces  I 
 haven't  you  know  discovered  yet  in  my 
 mind  and  I  really  love  that  about  life  I 
 love  mastering 
 self  I  love  it  I  love  it  there  there 
 there's  nothing  more  because  I  know 
 where  I  came  from  and  it's  amazing  that 
 where  I  came  from  that  person  could  have 
 died  that 
 very  fat  lazy  unfulfilled  person  and 
 with  inside  that  person  was  this  person 
 talking  to  you  is  very  freaky  to  me  and 
 a  lot  of  us  have  these  two  people  that 
 you  have  greatness  way  over  here  but  you 
 decide  to  live  in  this  space  over  here 
 because  between  greatness  or  between 
 this  space  here  and  greatness  there's  a 
 lot  of  [ __ ]  work  there's  so  much 
 space  to  fill  in  with  work  and  we  just 
 say  [ __ ]  it  I  just  stay  over  here  in 
 this  space  so  I  like  to  [ __ ]  examine 
 all  these  spaces  and  there's  there's 
 still  more  there's  still  more  still  a 
 lot  more  are  you  aiming  to  find  peace  at 
 any  point  think  about  this  I  love  that 
 question  I'm  glad  you  I'm  so  glad  you 
 asked 
 it  you  you  know  a  little  bit  about 
 me  when  you've  come  from  that  place  I 
 talk  about  to  the  place  of  him  now  it's 
 not  the  peace  you  find  it's  the  peace  I 
 find  and  I  find  so  much  peace  in  looking 
 back  at  that  young  David  8  years  old 
 with  white  splashes  on  his  face  and 
 stuttering  and  hair  patches  falling  out 
 and  I  look  at  him  I'm  like  man  there's 
 so  much  peace  in  knowing  what  I've 
 accomplished  and  what  I've  done  so  my 
 peace  may  be  different  for  others  that's 
 why  I  never  critique  or  never  judge 
 anyone  because  I  don't  know  your  story 
 where  you  come  from  I  found  peace  years 
 ago  years 
 ago  in  the  battle  in  the  battle  you  find 
 peace  when  you  go  to  war  with  yourself 
 you  find  a  lot  of  Peace  because  you  know 
 exactly  who  you  are  and  that  is  where 
 the  peace  is  really  found  for 
 me  David  you're  a  spectacular  individual 
 I  really  really  appreciate  your  time  uh 
 the  book  is  fantastic  your  message  is 
 fantastic  uh  I  can't  wait  to  see  what 
 you  do  next  even  if  it  takes  5  years  I
