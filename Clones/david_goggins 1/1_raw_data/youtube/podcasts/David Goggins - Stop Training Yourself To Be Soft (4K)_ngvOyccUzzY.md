[00:00] I'm trying to build people up I'm trying
[00:01] to armor their mind I'm trying to get
[00:03] them the belief because this world we
[00:05] live in is tough it will beat you down
[00:07] the world and the life that we live in
[00:09] is the ultimate competitor it will try
[00:11] to take you out it will find your
[00:12] weakness and it will just Hammer you if
[00:15] I can help you build belief build
[00:17] confidence to the point where nothing
[00:20] can hurt you because you know exactly
[00:21] who you
[00:25] are David Goggins welcome to the show
[00:28] hey man I appreciate you having me
[00:29] brother thank you thank you for being
[00:30] here where have you been for the last
[00:32] four years you've been jumping out of
[00:34] helicopters and fighting fires and what
[00:35] have you been doing well I did that last
[00:37] year right I guess this year I did that
[00:39] but I just I just do me you know I'm out
[00:42] there running working out and uh just
[00:46] trying to find out more of what this is
[00:47] all about trying to find out more of
[00:48] what I'm all about so that takes me
[00:51] getting away you know I'm not about even
[00:54] doing these podcasts man so not nothing
[00:56] against you but I'm I'm not about all
[00:59] this stuff I'm not one that likes to
[01:01] hear himself talk a lot um I'm about
[01:05] action and action means less talking and
[01:09] more doing so that's where I've been
[01:13] what is that smoke jumping stuff so
[01:15] basically it's um you know about
[01:17] Wildland firefighting about when the
[01:20] forest has fires there's a lot of times
[01:23] there's roads and there's access to get
[01:25] there so these you know whether it be a
[01:30] um hot shot crew or whatever these
[01:32] different Crews who come in by vehicle
[01:34] they can get into the fire that way what
[01:37] a smoke jumper is is you can't get a
[01:39] vehicle into that place it is a spot
[01:42] where it's tight there's no vehicles
[01:45] there's no access so they'll send us in
[01:48] there smoke jumpers jump out of
[01:49] airplanes and we'll land in these really
[01:52] tight small Drop Zones with all of our
[01:54] gear and we'll put the fire out how do
[01:58] you take Walter in we jump out so
[02:00] everything is hang on you're jumping out
[02:02] of a airplane parachute with backpacks
[02:06] of water like a camel pack type thing so
[02:08] we'll jump out we'll have this it's
[02:10] called a diddy pack and it and it sits
[02:12] in you know it sits like by your waist
[02:15] you know yep on your legs area when you
[02:17] jump out and that has a lot of your gear
[02:20] but what happens is once you jump out
[02:22] the aircraft would go lower and it will
[02:24] push out all the rest of your gear your
[02:27] water pumps oh and that'll get add with
[02:30] own little
[02:31] parachut so a lot of our main gear gets
[02:33] dropped into us and then we're out there
[02:36] for several days until the fire is put
[02:37] out by us and only
[02:39] us that's insane it's insane yeah why'
[02:43] you do that well when I left the
[02:45] military um you're I'm always looking
[02:47] for more I'm always looking for what's
[02:49] the next thing for myself how can I grow
[02:52] and that right there was the next thing
[02:54] for me you know I didn't want to sit
[02:57] back and you know just enjoy my
[02:58] retirement for the military that's
[03:01] there's there there's no growth in that
[03:03] so I decided to go out and do this so
[03:06] you jump out of an airplan with a team
[03:09] you get your kit also parachuted out of
[03:11] the back you're now in the middle of an
[03:13] area where there's no Evac there's no
[03:17] vehicles that can come and get you m
[03:19] there's a fire mhm you need to put the
[03:21] fire out and you don't stop until you're
[03:23] done that's it sometimes there is a way
[03:26] to get out but a lot of times it's just
[03:29] you know if someone gets hurt on the
[03:31] jump a lot of times we have to build
[03:34] like cut down a bunch of trees so a
[03:35] helicopter can come in land and get them
[03:37] out so we are the only access we have to
[03:41] save ourselves so a lot of times we are
[03:45] the team to get us in and to get us out
[03:48] what was the
[03:49] longest Mission exercise that you did I
[03:52] think the longest one I did was seven
[03:53] days so and what's the sort of daily
[03:55] routine are you sleeping do you get much
[03:57] sleep at all no not really so what
[03:58] happens is and the thing about being in
[04:00] Canada so I do this out of uh out of
[04:02] British Columbia so what happens is
[04:05] there's a lot of
[04:06] daylight when I'm so when I'm out there
[04:09] man there's a lot of daylight in the
[04:11] middle of the summer when it's Hest when
[04:12] you've got tons of right okay that's
[04:14] right so there's not much there's not
[04:16] much dark so you're basically working a
[04:19] lot of hours so and then when it gets
[04:21] dark you're actually working through the
[04:22] nighttime and then you get a little you
[04:24] know you get a little rest and you wake
[04:25] up and you're at it again and then when
[04:27] the fire is out you Patrol the fire fire
[04:30] make sure there's no more hot spots make
[04:32] sure everything is black and wet cuz we
[04:35] we literally wet the whole area down so
[04:38] there's no hot spots and then when
[04:40] that's all done we'll demob which means
[04:43] we'll clean up all the stuff all our
[04:45] hoses you know we'll we'll pack up all
[04:47] our stuff and then we'll we'll get out
[04:49] of there did you ask to be paid for this
[04:51] I I get about I think the the the pay is
[04:55] about 12 to 15 bucks an
[04:57] hour so it was about it man like when I
[05:00] first started doing this job um people
[05:05] didn't know that you know I'm actually
[05:09] successful in business and then it
[05:11] realized that I was like basically
[05:13] turned down millions of dollars to do
[05:17] this job and they can continue thinking
[05:19] it to make 15 bucks an hour to make 15
[05:21] bucks an hour so yeah but you know like
[05:24] I said for me the the the whole money
[05:27] part of it it's it's it's not with about
[05:30] I'm all about that growth and and that
[05:32] growth isn't in these massive paychecks
[05:35] for speaking to corporations stuff like
[05:37] that the growth for me is in that 12 to
[05:39] $15 an hour when you're out there and
[05:41] it's like 20 you know 20 degrees and
[05:45] you're freezing your ass off and you're
[05:46] thinking you know what I don't need to
[05:48] be here
[05:49] anymore and you start questioning
[05:51] yourself why you're here and there's a
[05:53] lot of growth in that why did you decide
[05:56] to release another book what Was undone
[05:58] with the first one well the first one
[06:00] was basically um a bachelor's degree
[06:04] with the mind that's how I look at it
[06:06] and no one knew who I was so this is the
[06:08] book never finished as the book that I
[06:10] wanted to come out first but how am I
[06:13] going to get so deep into something when
[06:15] no one Els who the hell I am so first I
[06:18] have to give you some backstory on who
[06:19] the hell David Goggins is some
[06:20] credentials that's it and so I got some
[06:23] basic credentials out there and now I
[06:26] can dive in more because most people
[06:27] think I'm just some Grand animal who
[06:28] runs and yells and just says [ __ ] and
[06:31] mother [ __ ] all the time and that's
[06:33] nowhere near the truth that's maybe what
[06:36] they see in a one minute video and
[06:38] that's what people believe but there's a
[06:40] lot of thought behind a person being a
[06:44] Bor and loser becoming who I am today
[06:47] you don't just wake up and just Rocky
[06:50] the [ __ ] you gotta wake up and think
[06:52] about you know there's a process to
[06:53] getting better and that process is never
[06:57] finished it's an appropriate title so
[07:00] one of the things I've been thinking
[07:01] about is the danger of success making
[07:03] you soft and this must be something that
[07:06] you've battled with over the last few
[07:08] years right more money more attention
[07:11] more Fame more free things if you wanted
[07:13] more opportunities to go places and do
[07:14] stuff with people right how have you
[07:17] dealt with this battle of success not
[07:19] making you soft you have to cap it you
[07:22] have to learn to cap success so what I
[07:25] do is like right now I don't like doing
[07:28] podcasts there's a lot of things I don't
[07:30] do I have to do now to get the messes
[07:32] out there to help people out and what I
[07:34] mean by capping success I believe
[07:36] everybody should live their life so
[07:39] everything that someone says in life
[07:41] take it with a grain of salt take what
[07:44] they give and don't be like oh David
[07:47] Goin said this or whoever said this
[07:49] no do not take what I say and do exactly
[07:53] what I say so for me what makes me who I
[07:57] am because my mission is very different
[07:58] than yours anybody else's I have to go
[08:01] into a situation
[08:03] okay I'm a guy who wants to make people
[08:07] better for people to get better I have
[08:10] to continuously get better myself for me
[08:13] to do that I can't just say oh I have
[08:16] this resume the resume is there forever
[08:19] I'm
[08:20] good I have to cap My Success because
[08:23] for me to help people out I can't just
[08:25] say I did it once and I'm good I have to
[08:29] continue to reinvent the will of the
[08:31] mind and figure out more and more ways
[08:34] for you to pull because if I have a
[08:36] cookie cutter message it may hit five
[08:38] people out of 25 you just
[08:42] failed my message needs to be in a way
[08:45] where I can hit all 25 people it needs
[08:48] to be broad enough to where all 25
[08:51] people may not like the message but
[08:53] they're getting something from it and
[08:55] that is evolution you must continue to
[08:58] evolve and and you don't evolve for me
[09:01] in my job unless I cap myself somewhere
[09:03] and say okay you made this much money
[09:06] get back to [ __ ] work it's time to
[09:08] get back to work stop hearing yourself
[09:11] talk get off the podcast don't be on
[09:13] social media too much cut out all the
[09:15] [ __ ] noise get back to the [ __ ]
[09:17] mental lab because that's where the
[09:19] knowledge came from so for me I must cap
[09:22] myself so I can come back with better
[09:24] more unique knowledge versus the C know
[09:27] all that cookie hutter knowledge that's
[09:29] out there
[09:30] that's why people buy the books I have
[09:31] because it's not cookie cutter it's real
[09:33] knowledge the other thing now is when
[09:36] you first started you were a Lone Ranger
[09:39] right nobody really knew who you were
[09:40] outside of some obscure endurance places
[09:43] and half-heard truths of these weird
[09:45] myths right but now you've got people's
[09:47] expectations layed on top as well so not
[09:50] only have you got to deal with success
[09:52] potentially making you soft so you've
[09:53] got to cap that you've got to say no to
[09:55] more money and opportunities and cool
[09:56] people right you've also got this extra
[09:58] layer of expect
[10:00] that's coming through from other people
[10:01] too and I think that you talk about
[10:02] trained humility right in the new book
[10:04] too I've got to presume that that fits
[10:07] into this equation right it fits in big
[10:09] time um and that's one big reason why I
[10:11] do fight fire because the all the
[10:15] knowledge for myself comes from that
[10:17] place it doesn't come from the place of
[10:19] success my knowledge does not come from
[10:21] the place like because for me like I
[10:24] built Goggins from the ground up I was
[10:27] born David goggin David gogins wasn't
[10:29] good enough enough he was a scared
[10:32] bullied uh abused kid um who struggled
[10:36] in
[10:37] life and that kid whenever something got
[10:40] tough no matter how hard I trained no
[10:42] matter how ready I
[10:44] was whenever something got tough for me
[10:48] David goggin the real David Goggins
[10:50] would come out and he would quit so I
[10:53] realized this over a period of time so I
[10:56] had to build
[10:57] goggin and in that process I have to go
[11:01] back to that mental lab and that mental
[11:03] lab is at scratch that mental lab isn't
[11:07] that trained humility and so that's
[11:10] where I get better I get better when I'm
[11:14] digging holes in the ground when I'm
[11:17] waking up early knowing I don't have to
[11:18] do these things that's where I get
[11:20] better so it's important to stay hungry
[11:22] it's important to stay hungry but it's
[11:25] important more to stay humble within
[11:27] that hunger so why you're hungry a lot
[11:30] of people are hungry but humility is
[11:33] everything what was that story about
[11:35] William Crawford the janitor yeah so
[11:38] this guy won the Medal of Honor so he
[11:41] won the Medal of Honor and which is the
[11:43] highest award in the
[11:45] military and this guy went to the Air
[11:49] Force Academy and he was a
[11:52] janitor and no one knew who the [ __ ]
[11:55] this man was he had the highest award in
[11:58] all the milit military for heroics for
[12:02] heroics saving lives putting his life on
[12:03] the line could have you know could have
[12:05] been killed and he is now basically you
[12:10] know cleaning [ __ ] for young kids
[12:14] and we can all imagine how that probably
[12:16] went you know there's probably some you
[12:18] know little bit of taunting here and
[12:20] there and he just sat there and cleaned
[12:21] the [ __ ] so that's why he's in my
[12:23] trained humility part because for this
[12:26] man to be at the level he was and had
[12:28] that kind of humility to go I'm a MD of
[12:31] Honor winner but I'm gonna put that in
[12:33] my closet and I'm gonna pick up my broom
[12:35] and dust pan and I'm gonna pick up you
[12:37] know this Rag and clean this [ __ ] for
[12:39] these young men that right there is
[12:41] amazing for me man that's that's where
[12:43] you grow that's that's growth huge
[12:45] growth and also it shows that he was
[12:47] doing his
[12:48] job he was a
[12:50] servant he didn't look at himself any
[12:52] better than anybody else the second you
[12:55] do that you're totally lost you cannot
[12:57] look at yourself like people with me
[12:59] even I always look at people I I know
[13:03] where you are I know where because I've
[13:05] been there that's why I helped so many
[13:07] people out I've I've never been above
[13:10] you I've always pretty much been beneath
[13:13] you and that's where my knowledge came
[13:14] from so I know how to reach those people
[13:16] who are in the dungeon because I've been
[13:19] there so many times speaking of getting
[13:21] too soft did you see that there was a
[13:23] news story that came out recently about
[13:25] the treatment of seals during the
[13:26] selection process do you see this yeah
[13:29] yeah I saw it yeah they were getting uh
[13:31] sprayed with tear gas whilst they were
[13:33] on the ground and they were made to sing
[13:34] Happy Birthday so that they couldn't
[13:36] hold their breath while it was happening
[13:38] and there was a a quote from uh this guy
[13:41] I think this type of training is really
[13:43] senseless said Sven yort a Juke
[13:46] University associate professor who
[13:48] studies tear gas and its effects it
[13:50] looks more like a form of hazing right I
[13:52] see all that trust me like I said you
[13:56] know I'm not g to sugarcoat anything
[14:00] I understand that guy I understand
[14:03] exactly where you're coming from that is
[14:05] your personal opinion and I totally get
[14:08] that
[14:10] but there's very few people in this
[14:13] world who want to do a job like that and
[14:15] it takes a different kind of
[14:17] mindset is it tear grass appropriate I
[14:21] don't
[14:22] know how hard that training is I don't
[14:25] expect anybody to understand it but one%
[14:29] but the loud voices of this world are
[14:33] the 99% who don't understand exactly
[14:36] what you have to do that's why when I
[14:38] speak and you don't understand me it's
[14:39] probably a good thing because that
[14:41] probably means I'm in an area of life
[14:46] that you're not in which is fine that's
[14:49] why I don't judge people and this guy
[14:50] right here judging that unless you've
[14:52] been there and done that and you really
[14:55] can't speak about it unless you're in
[14:58] those situations that are so hard that
[15:01] takes a special human being to get
[15:03] through them I think it's the same kind
[15:06] of feeling that I get when I heard about
[15:09] Elon Musk telling the employees at
[15:11] Twitter M we're going to ask you to work
[15:14] harder than you've ever worked in your
[15:15] life this is a place Twitter is now a
[15:17] company where people can go if they want
[15:19] to be in the top not. one% of
[15:22] hardworking programmers and software
[15:23] developers on the planet that's right
[15:26] and there was everybody was up in arms
[15:28] this is unbelievable we're going back to
[15:29] this old version of capitalism where the
[15:32] the worker is being abused and used and
[15:34] thrown away what they didn't account for
[15:36] is that there is a non insignificant
[15:38] cohort of people for whom that's their
[15:40] dream that's right people who want to be
[15:42] able to get up on a morning having gone
[15:44] to bed 4 hours before and can contribute
[15:47] to some sort of progress that they think
[15:49] this this is what I'm here for yep and
[15:52] it's the same with the seals if you're
[15:53] not the sort of person that is built to
[15:55] go through selection it's like speaking
[15:57] a different language
[15:59] and that's why I don't try to convince
[16:02] people otherwise I understand that why
[16:06] you're confused I understand why you say
[16:09] things like that I'm not saying anything
[16:11] bad about that I understand it but also
[16:15] what you don't understand what you fail
[16:17] to understand is the other side that you
[16:20] need people like that you need the Elon
[16:24] musks you need the David Goggins you
[16:27] need some of these Navy some of these
[16:29] other people you need those people and
[16:32] they don't they forget that and it takes
[16:34] a very very unique person and unique
[16:38] mind to do some of these jobs that are
[16:40] necessary in this world well especially
[16:43] when we're thinking about someone going
[16:44] to war right do you want your Armed
[16:46] Forces to be underprepared for the
[16:48] battlefield because you didn't want to
[16:50] be too mean to them in
[16:52] advance that's that's the problem that's
[16:55] the problem and that's a problem that
[16:57] I've always had I've always had is that
[17:00] right there is that with even even some
[17:03] of the most trained people in the world
[17:07] fall back on that it's easy to talk
[17:09] about like I said when you go through it
[17:12] once when it's a perishable
[17:17] skill
[17:18] hardness mental hardening mental
[17:21] toughness it's a perishable skill just
[17:23] because you went through some training
[17:26] once and you got through it doesn't mean
[17:28] it lasts [ __ ] forever and that's where
[17:30] most people hated me in my life because
[17:34] I realized that you don't to say oh I
[17:37] got it I'm checked off I'm good for the
[17:38] rest of my life that's why you have
[17:39] recall you recall on [ __ ] everything
[17:42] and you definitely must recall when it
[17:44] comes to the mind that is one of the
[17:46] biggest requalification you must have
[17:49] and when you're at that level you gotta
[17:51] recall every [ __ ] day not once a year
[17:54] one of the other things that you did to
[17:55] stop yourself from getting soft was
[17:56] running the Moab 240 yep talk me through
[18:00] that experience so um I hadn't Run 100
[18:04] mile race in I think it was about 6
[18:06] years you know I had you know some heart
[18:08] surgeries I had some maybe some
[18:12] questioning in my mind about I call it
[18:14] part-time Savage I started kind of going
[18:17] through this I started getting you know
[18:18] a little bit injuries a little bit this
[18:19] a little that things that back in the
[18:21] day never slowed me
[18:22] down so when I got my head out of my ass
[18:25] and realized that hey we have more left
[18:28] we can still push harder we're not there
[18:31] yet I realized talking to a guy named
[18:34] Cameron Haynes who this race 240 mile
[18:36] race and um I say I go is this the is
[18:40] this the new level is this the new is
[18:42] this the new push so when I decided to
[18:45] do that race it was in the back of my
[18:47] mind like man I've really become an
[18:49] expert at running 100 mile races so for
[18:53] me this was the new level the 200 plus
[18:56] mile race and what was so amazing about
[18:59] that as you probably read in the book I
[19:03] had a hard time the first time doing it
[19:05] I came back and did better but what's
[19:08] amazing about the human mind is that it
[19:11] becomes your new
[19:12] Norm like to to to think that I can run
[19:16] 200 miles 240 miles and that becomes
[19:18] like running 50 I never thought that was
[19:21] possible this is why I'm I'm always
[19:23] pushing that limit because I know that
[19:27] within pushing these limits there's
[19:29] always more so I end up doing like
[19:32] almost like backtack 200 mile runs when
[19:36] the 200 mile race 240 mile race was hard
[19:38] at once it became something that was
[19:40] very easy after I figured it out so
[19:44] that's why that happened well you got
[19:46] lost on the first one oh yeah and then
[19:49] you went to bed and woke up halfway
[19:52] through the night and nudged Kish and
[19:56] said how long have we got left until the
[19:59] end of the race but because you hadn't
[20:02] completed the official route you
[20:04] couldn't go across the official Finish
[20:06] Line yeah so you ring your race um like
[20:10] Pacers some of whom had gone home yep
[20:13] what like what what do you think it's 3
[20:15] in the morning and you're ringing people
[20:16] saying you know that race that we just
[20:18] finished because of health problems can
[20:19] we go back and finish it so the crazy
[20:21] thing about that and that and that's but
[20:23] so I got lost the first time I got
[20:26] seriously sick was off Court so
[20:29] basically I bed down about 12 hours then
[20:33] I got back in the race so I was still a
[20:35] part of the official race now okay so
[20:37] the first time I got lost I I got sick
[20:39] got back got lost got back in the race
[20:42] after 12 hours of being out of the race
[20:45] so now I get to about 200 and some miles
[20:48] and I'm sick as hell can't breathe H out
[20:51] to pulmonary edema totally jacked up and
[20:56] now the doctor tells me if if you get
[20:58] off course now and you go to the doctor
[21:00] you won't be able to come back and
[21:02] finish the race so I had to make a call
[21:04] like you know what I'm pretty messed up
[21:06] got off so this is where you're talking
[21:08] about I'm literally laying in bed and
[21:11] I'm feeling
[21:12] better and I thought honestly I swear to
[21:16] God I thought that someone was speaking
[21:18] to me I thought it was Jennifer it was
[21:20] like you're not done yet [ __ ]
[21:23] and I'm like what the [ __ ] is this it
[21:25] was actually probably my subconscious
[21:27] saying get your ass back out there so I
[21:30] wake Jennifer up I'm like hey how much
[21:31] time do we have until the cut off I know
[21:33] that I'm already you know dnfed so
[21:36] matter what happens here I'm not going
[21:38] to be an official finisher of this race
[21:39] this isn't for Glory no this is now for
[21:42] the fact that you can so either you can
[21:46] sit here and not and think about that
[21:48] for a whole year until you come back
[21:50] here and do this or you can go out there
[21:52] for yourself and take some some kind of
[21:54] pride in knowing that you could and you
[21:57] did
[21:59] so basically I wake her up how much time
[22:01] left she goes something like I don't
[22:03] know what it was how would you say what
[22:05] time
[22:06] was like you know whatever and half my
[22:10] crew had left and there was two people
[22:13] there I woke them up they were getting
[22:15] ready to get on a plane I said look can
[22:17] you guys help me out I have 40 miles to
[22:20] go I'm GNA have Jennifer drop me back
[22:22] off at the spot where I left I'm GNA
[22:25] finish this [ __ ]
[22:27] race and I couldn't cross the finish
[22:29] line because I wasn't an official
[22:30] finisher so I end up finishing on a road
[22:34] on you know by a by a telephone pole and
[22:37] that was my official finish end up being
[22:39] like 250 M 255 miles but it's one of the
[22:43] best races of all time because we're
[22:45] going through it
[22:46] fast but all the [ __ ] times that I
[22:50] was like this is I I'm not going back
[22:53] and I went back I'm not going back and I
[22:54] went back I'm not going back and I went
[22:56] back it showed me even more of what we
[22:59] have as as as humans if we're willing to
[23:02] go there and we're willing to push that
[23:04] extra step and like I said you know I
[23:06] always tell people a lot of people man
[23:08] how do you do what you
[23:10] do at the end of the day I ask myself
[23:12] one question can I take one more step
[23:16] and usually the answer is yes so if you
[23:19] can answer that question and not take
[23:20] another step that is real failure that
[23:24] is real quitting so a lot of people can
[23:27] take one more step but they choose not
[23:28] to I don't know if you can take two
[23:30] steps you got to answer that question
[23:32] after you take the first
[23:34] step but I can always take one more step
[23:37] so if I choose not to that's on me and I
[23:39] gota live with that does that link in
[23:41] with the one second decision yes yes so
[23:45] the one second decision is I had to live
[23:49] through that one second decision several
[23:51] times during this race so this race took
[23:55] me a hundred and some hours okay and
[23:58] this is what people don't get for you to
[24:01] finish that race even though I dnfed I
[24:03] still finished in the time so there's a
[24:06] lot of pride in that if you're 10 and
[24:09] some OD hours let me use hell week this
[24:12] is a perfect example hell week is 130
[24:15] hours and 130 hours is a lot of
[24:20] seconds a lot of [ __ ] seconds and if
[24:24] you lose let's say you win every second
[24:27] but one
[24:29] you
[24:30] lost it only takes one second for you to
[24:33] lose the whole thing so the one second
[24:35] decision is just that you're in a
[24:38] situation where life is sucking let's
[24:41] say you're in extreme cold water and
[24:44] your life is flashing before your eyes
[24:48] every time that wave goes over your head
[24:49] your thought process is I got to get the
[24:52] [ __ ] out of this
[24:53] water and you're in hell week and you're
[24:57] hour one of 130 [ __ ]
[25:00] hours it's all fun and games okay
[25:04] because at the beginning of Hell Week
[25:05] the guns are going off it's like a pep
[25:07] rally so you're [ __ ] hyped up and
[25:10] your boys are linked arms and you're
[25:12] getting sprayed and it's like a [ __ ]
[25:14] peep rally the instructure yelling at
[25:16] your bombs are going off concussion
[25:19] grenades blanks from in60s yeah who yah
[25:22] [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah [ __ ]
[25:26] yeah but then what they do is they shut
[25:28] that [ __ ] off they shut it
[25:31] off all that huah all that hype gets
[25:35] real
[25:36] quiet and they March you out to that
[25:38] surf zone for something called surf
[25:41] torture and it's that water that Pacific
[25:44] Ocean is cold as [ __ ] so no more prep
[25:47] rally you're now in your head you're
[25:49] linked arms with you know your brothers
[25:52] beside you you don't know if they could
[25:53] be there long or not you don't care you
[25:55] think about
[25:56] yourself you lay back in that first wave
[25:59] hit
[26:00] you your mind goes straight from hour
[26:05] two all the way to hour 130 you can't
[26:09] process five days of this [ __ ] you're
[26:11] now in you're you're now in a [ __ ] you
[26:13] like I gotta get out of here you're in
[26:14] fight or flight it's cold I can't be
[26:17] cold this long and then this is where
[26:19] that one second decision comes in you
[26:22] forgot every reason why you wanted to be
[26:24] there you don't care about seals you
[26:27] don't care about any of this you don't
[26:28] care about fighting for your country you
[26:30] don't care about that Gody gold Trident
[26:33] that they put on your chest you don't
[26:34] care about any of that [ __ ] no more all
[26:36] you want to do is go back home you want
[26:39] the warmth you may want something to eat
[26:41] you want your girl to hold you all those
[26:43] things of comfort are there in that one
[26:45] second and this is where people
[26:48] lose so what I do in that one second
[26:51] because we all think about quitting when
[26:52] shit's hard but what you have to do in
[26:55] that one second is hard to process
[26:58] information during
[27:00] pain because that pain takes over and
[27:04] you can't think rationally you're
[27:07] thinking about fight or flight save
[27:10] yourself that's not a rational thought
[27:12] it's not a thought that's going to get
[27:14] you through hard
[27:16] times most people fail that one second
[27:19] so what happens what I do in that one
[27:21] second it's and there's a bigger process
[27:23] to all this but in that one
[27:25] second I physically stayed in in that
[27:29] water because if I get out of the water
[27:31] I quit so I physically stay in the water
[27:33] but
[27:34] mentally I'm on the [ __ ] beach with
[27:36] the [ __ ] instructors and the
[27:38] instructors is cold outside so they got
[27:40] these Parkers on they got their cup of
[27:42] [ __ ] Joe and they're warm because
[27:44] they've already been through it so now
[27:46] it's your turn to go through it so
[27:48] mainly I get back with them I'm still in
[27:50] the water physically but mainly I'm back
[27:52] I'm chilling I got my Parker on and now
[27:54] I'm thinking logically cuz I'm warm now
[27:57] mentally warm I've taken that one
[28:00] second let's not quit yet Goggins let's
[28:02] [ __ ] think about your options where
[28:05] are you going to end up if you quit this
[28:07] [ __ ] where you gon to go what are you g
[28:09] to say to yourself because you know
[28:11] you're going to get warm the second you
[28:13] get out this water you GNA take a shower
[28:15] and you could be warm and you could be
[28:17] and in five days you could be out so I
[28:19] start thinking
[28:20] logically I calm my brain down because
[28:23] your brain just wants to get the [ __ ]
[28:24] out ring the bell push your hmet down
[28:25] get warm and then you're really [ __ ]
[28:28] and these are the things you have to
[28:29] think about the one second decision so
[28:32] that's what that's all about it's about
[28:34] gaining control of your mind putting
[28:37] things back in the proper
[28:39] perspective and then saying I really do
[28:42] want to be here and I'm G to have a
[28:44] bunch of these 1 seconds through this
[28:46] 130 hour journey and I have to learn to
[28:50] control these because if I fail one of
[28:52] these one seconds I will not be a seal I
[28:55] will not be a doctor I will not be a
[28:56] lawyer I will not be whatever the [ __ ]
[28:58] is so that's how important that one
[29:00] second decision is it's all about your
[29:03] mind takes control of you you have to
[29:05] say [ __ ] you I run this
[29:08] [ __ ] and that's what that's all
[29:10] about we'll get back to Goggins in one
[29:12] minute but first I need to tell you
[29:13] about element element is a tasty
[29:15] electrolyte drink mix with everything
[29:17] that you need and nothing that you don't
[29:19] I've replaced my morning coffee with
[29:20] element every day for over 3 years now
[29:23] and I've never looked back it means I've
[29:24] optimized my hydration my brain feels
[29:26] better I'm not getting mental f and it's
[29:28] helping me to curb Cravings if I'm
[29:30] fasting throughout the day even video
[29:32] guine uses it my favorite flavor is the
[29:34] orange that in a cold glass of water
[29:36] upon waking feels really really good
[29:38] it's a science backed electrolyte ratio
[29:40] of sodium potassium and magnesium which
[29:42] helps me to feel my absolute best all
[29:44] day also they have a nobs no questions

[29:54] even need to return the box that's how

[29:58] head to drink LM nt.com slod wisdom to
[30:03] get a free sample pack of all eight
[30:05] flavors with your first box that's drink
[30:07] lm.com
[30:09] modern wisdom projecting yourself
[30:13] forward to see what are the consequences
[30:16] of failing what are the consequences of
[30:18] stopping yep is about as powerful of a
[30:21] motivation strategies as I can think of
[30:24] you know because what you're doing is
[30:25] you're trying to optimize right now to
[30:27] stop the discomfort that's right but
[30:29] what you're going to pay for that in is
[30:31] shame and guilt and regret long term
[30:35] that's right so what you need to be able
[30:36] to do is bundle all of that up that is
[30:39] as yet unfelt but will last for way way
[30:42] way longer you know the future is much
[30:44] longer than now that's right the future
[30:45] is going to extend out up until the day
[30:46] that you die and the now is just for now
[30:49] and even 130 hours is just 130 hours
[30:51] that's right and you get to look back
[30:53] and do you look back with Pride and
[30:54] Glory or do you look back with shame and
[30:56] guilt that's it that's that's the one
[30:58] second you just summarized it right
[31:00] there and most people fail those one
[31:02] seconds and then that one second leads
[31:04] to 20 years 30 years 40 Years of [ __ ] I
[31:09] have people who have been through
[31:11] training with me Ranger school SEAL
[31:13] training Air Force training and I get
[31:15] calls from them today and they have
[31:17] great lives and all they talk about is
[31:20] how they failed in that one moment and
[31:23] they can't even great they can't even
[31:27] enjoy eny their life now because they're
[31:30] now
[31:32] warm they're now warm there's no more
[31:34] suffering there's no more suffering for
[31:36] me either and we're in the same boat now
[31:40] but you're suffering and so we're not
[31:43] suffering but you're thinking about what
[31:45] you could have been I am exactly what I
[31:47] should have been and that's where people
[31:50] start to lose it because now I realize
[31:53] that in that one second I go through all
[31:55] that I know how it's going to feel CU I
[31:57] failed so many times before failure is
[32:00] the ultimate thing man I failed so many
[32:02] times before that's why I don't look at
[32:04] failure anymore as failure I look as my
[32:06] first second and third
[32:07] attempt so that's what that's all about
[32:10] man well I mean you went back to go and
[32:11] do Moab again the second time right
[32:13] which is your second attempt that's
[32:15] right had you banged your knee up it was
[32:18] pretty bad in between the first and the
[32:19] second one it was pretty bad way before
[32:21] either one of them uhhuh yeah yeah it
[32:23] was it's been jacked up now for about 20
[32:25] years I've seen some nly photos of it
[32:26] recently it looks yeah yeah interesting
[32:29] yeah so all those miles I've run on this
[32:31] thing it's it's uh it's been a lot of uh
[32:34] it's been a lot of gut checks so you go
[32:36] back you do Moab a second time yep and
[32:39] then you turn your ass into like a
[32:42] hamburger or
[32:43] something as well so it's not just the
[32:45] knee it's the ass as well now yeah so at
[32:47] Mile 2011 we have a good video of it
[32:50] matter of fact Jennifer is like there's
[32:52] some people up so at at so 201 is a spot
[32:57] where
[32:58] I was really finished in the first Moab
[33:02] so that was a um way Mark a checkpoint
[33:05] for you the second time so Jennifer is
[33:06] extremely happy right now because I'm
[33:08] there yes and she knows I'm doing well
[33:11] now I'm doing good we're gonna get
[33:12] through this and so she's videoing me as
[33:14] I'm coming up this climb on this road
[33:17] and she goes there's some people up here
[33:19] who want to meet you you're doing so
[33:21] amazing I said my ass is [ __ ] up you
[33:26] need to get the [ __ ] desant cream and
[33:30] it's literally for like 20 [ __ ]
[33:34] miles that like people don't get it man
[33:37] when you get raw like that bro and
[33:40] you're walking cuz you the the chaing of
[33:44] my ass it was hamburger meat and I'm
[33:46] like so she's all [ __ ] happy and [ __ ]
[33:49] she's and I just look at her and I'm
[33:52] gonna put the video up on social media
[33:53] cuz it's it's but she's a [ __ ]
[33:55] Trooper bro hang on so could she was the
[33:59] leakage oh yeah that was on the video

[34:06] raw dogged yeah so when you pull them
[34:09] down it's just blood and so she goes in
[34:13] the bathroom because she didn't know
[34:14] what she was going to see she has a
[34:16] Destin cream she walks in there and I
[34:20] pull them down and spread them open and
[34:23] I go put that [ __ ] all up in there so

[34:45] on my back before I go lay out that's
[34:48] how she was in there man getting in it
[34:51] that's it man have you considered that
[34:52] that might be the most traumatic event
[34:54] of all of the things that you've done in
[34:55] your life what you asked Jennifer to do
[34:57] that day no not at all she did
[35:01] worse so that Leadville chapter when I
[35:04] talk about after I finished and then the
[35:06] ultra raveling or unraveling had had
[35:09] begun when I lay down so oh that was on
[35:12] the duvet and you didn't know the word
[35:14] duv yeah I know what the [ __ ] duve was
[35:15] [ __ ] you don't know the word duv blanket
[35:17] man okay fair enough fair enough fair
[35:19] enough out from the streets we call them
[35:20] blankets anything that you wrap up in as
[35:22] a [ __ ] blanket cool so I'm laying on
[35:26] the duvet
[35:27] and she's all [ __ ] like about her
[35:29] damn ratings that [ __ ] the Airbnb
[35:32] [ __ ] and I'm L like hey I'm about to
[35:34] [ __ ] right here because it's not your
[35:36] place
[35:37] no okay no right yes I can see why she
[35:41] be consern so that scene is uh is is was
[35:44] was bad but once again like a crime
[35:47] scene it's yes it was a crime scene so
[35:50] you've done all of this stuff right
[35:51] you've done the seal selection week
[35:54] three times strapping the legs up so
[35:57] that you can Runner badwater Ultra race
[36:00] the Asbergers everything yes of all of
[36:03] the physical Pursuits that you've
[36:04] endured which has been the most painful
[36:06] by far by far my first 100 mile
[36:10] race by far this
[36:14] 2019 Moab the one that I D enough but
[36:17] still finished that's up there but when
[36:20] you
[36:22] are um so I guess you're you're you're
[36:26] not prepared to run 100 miles and you
[36:29] take it for granted and you didn't do
[36:31] any training at all and you didn't have
[36:33] the right nutrition and off of whim like
[36:37] literally like you know what I want to
[36:38] raise money for a foundation that's how
[36:41] that happened so I don't know if you
[36:42] know the story or not but basically I'm
[36:44] sitting there and the Lan Survivor
[36:48] incident happened where a bunch of you
[36:49] know some seals died I want to raise
[36:51] money for them I went through training
[36:52] with most of these guys so I had the
[36:54] bright idea to uh raise money you know I
[36:58] wasn't going to do a hot dog or
[36:59] hamburger sale I was going to do
[37:01] something that people would be attracted
[37:03] to so I Googled the world's toughest
[37:05] events and what comes up is this race
[37:08] called the badwater
[37:09] 135 and it's 135 mile race through Death
[37:12] Valley in the summertime now I had no
[37:15] idea about ultr running I didn't know
[37:17] what the [ __ ] ultr running was but when
[37:20] I heard so when I saw 135 miles I
[37:24] automatically assumed it was a stage
[37:27] race where you ran like maybe 10 15
[37:29] miles bed down and you got up next
[37:30] morning did it so when I called the race
[37:33] director up Chris Cosman I'm like hey I
[37:35] would like to do this race to raise
[37:37] money for a foundation he goes have you
[37:38] ever run a 100
[37:39] miles and I was like like in in a week
[37:43] or like like what are you talking about
[37:44] he goes no like in 24 hours because
[37:46] that's what you got to do to qualify and
[37:48] I was like is that even is that even
[37:50] possible like I I didn't know so anyway
[37:53] he goes no you can't get in my race
[37:55] unless you qualify and I call him up on
[37:57] a Wednesday and that Saturday and I was
[38:01] a bodybuilder at the time I did cardio
[38:05] 20 minutes a week on the elliptical
[38:06] trainer every Sunday he goes yeah
[38:09] Saturday you're in San Diego Saturday is
[38:13] uh 24hour race where you run around a
[38:15] one mile track for 24 hours and if you
[38:18] can get 100 miles I'll consider you my
[38:21] race so I'll go sign up for this race
[38:25] and the first 70 miles I'm doing pretty
[38:28] good and then I hadn't sat down I was uh
[38:32] hadn't gone to the bathroom I was eating
[38:35] I was drinking myoplex and Rich crackers
[38:38] I was you know eating Rich crackers so
[38:39] Elite nutrition yeah elite elite high
[38:42] quality
[38:43] nutrition so what happens when you're
[38:46] that ignorant and you go out to do this
[38:48] race and you sit down in a chair your
[38:51] body's done so I'm sitting there and
[38:55] when you sit down for the first time in
[38:56] over 12 hours
[38:58] your body's now going through some
[39:01] metamorphosis like go [ __ ] home go go
[39:04] to a doctor get some help but I'm
[39:07] sitting there and I have this urge to go
[39:10] to the
[39:11] bathroom and there's a porter potty for
[39:13] me that [ __ ] wall but I can't get up
[39:15] because my blood pressure is all messed
[39:16] up from my great nutrition that I was on
[39:19] and so I can't stand up so I look at my
[39:23] ex-wife and I literally say I'm want to
[39:25] [ __ ] on myself right now so I sit there
[39:27] and I'm I'm [ __ ] up my back and I'm
[39:29] peeing blood down my leg and I have 30
[39:31] miles to go and I end up finding away to
[39:36] get through that 30 miles and when I got
[39:39] done with that
[39:41] race it's the worst pain I can ever even
[39:45] I can't even describe the pain of that
[39:47] last 30 miles to anybody no one it's
[39:50] very hard whole body whole body I'm so
[39:54] when it ended I I I'm literally
[39:58] dizzy going up my stairs to to get to my
[40:00] house I'm literally I have my arms
[40:02] wrapped around her going up the stairs
[40:04] and every flight of stairs I got have to
[40:06] lay down because I can't stay upright
[40:09] for too long or I'm G pass out so I
[40:12] finally get in the house and when I get
[40:14] in the house I'm once again on the floor
[40:16] I'm in the kitchen on the floor just
[40:18] laying there I finally make it to the
[40:21] bathroom into the tub I get rolled in
[40:24] the tub and she puts the water on me I'm
[40:26] just laying there with the water coming
[40:28] on me and what I pee out looks like
[40:32] cocacola and I'm laying there in the
[40:34] worst pain of my entire life I'm shaken
[40:38] I'm jacked up and all I could think
[40:41] about
[40:43] was I can't believe what I just done
[40:46] because when you get to 70 miles of a
[40:49] race and you felt the way I
[40:51] did it's to me it was humanly impossible
[40:55] to even think about going 30 more miles
[40:58] in that shape and once you do it what
[41:00] what came over me when that shower hit
[41:02] me and the reality hit that I SP 101
[41:06] miles and that last 31 miles was
[41:08] something that I can't even describe to
[41:11] people and she's like we got get you to
[41:13] the hospital so at the time my mom was
[41:16] seeing this doctor and he was like you
[41:19] know so so she's describing to my mom
[41:21] I'm going through he's like you gotta
[41:22] get in the hospital now and I just said
[41:25] just just shut up and let me enjoy this
[41:29] pain I don't want anything to numb it I
[41:32] don't want anything right now because
[41:34] what I had done was I just in my mind
[41:37] and people would take this wrong and
[41:39] take as wrong as you want to I don't
[41:40] really care I had just climbed a mental
[41:45] wall that was amazing and I didn't want
[41:48] anybody to take that pain away from me
[41:50] at that point because that was that was
[41:52] all confirmation it seems like I've
[41:54] heard you tell that story a number of
[41:55] times amazing
[41:58] did that set the tone or the Rhythm for
[42:02] what you wanted to try and Achieve and
[42:04] feel again each time there's you're
[42:07] pushing further there's more difficulty
[42:09] I never want to feel it again I never
[42:11] want to feel it again but what it did
[42:14] was it showed me what is possible and
[42:18] that's what set the new stage for me
[42:20] that's when I realized oh man I've
[42:22] really been underachieving my entire
[42:24] life I'm not saying that you have to go
[42:26] to that place because that place is a
[42:29] dangerous dangerous place that
[42:30] borderline rabdo heart everything it was
[42:33] borderline rabo it was all that y but
[42:36] you don't you don't want to go there but
[42:40] it taught me what is possible so from
[42:43] that 19-hour lesson one the best biggest
[42:46] lesson had my life it it taught me like
[42:48] okay I got it check tell me about this
[42:52] mixed type of hate that you've
[42:54] made so what started happening
[42:57] is as you get bigger as you get more
[43:00] successful you open the door for people
[43:04] to critique every [ __ ] thing you do
[43:07] and most of the people who are
[43:08] critiquing you usually aren't where you
[43:11] are and all their critiquing comes from
[43:14] people who are really at a low level of
[43:16] life which is sad but what we do people
[43:20] who are on the upper level hearing the
[43:22] haters at the lower level like I said
[43:25] you'll never meet a hater doing better
[43:26] than you true
[43:28] statement I started having fun with it
[43:31] so I'll go through the comments while
[43:33] while most people don't go through
[43:34] comments I go through and intentionally
[43:36] look for the bad
[43:38] ones and while I'll block and delete you
[43:41] because the people on my page don't need
[43:43] that negative energy I'll block and
[43:45] delete you but I take a snapshot on my
[43:48] phone and I put it in the archive so
[43:51] what happens is there's days where I'm
[43:53] like you know what I really don't want
[43:55] to do this today I'm like oh hang on so
[43:59] I started making these mixtapes with all
[44:03] of these hate messages about people
[44:06] talking [ __ ] and it became such a source
[44:10] of fuel that it was amazing because I
[44:13] know why you hate me you hate me because
[44:15] you're probably in the bed right now
[44:17] you're probably an underachiever you're
[44:19] probably somebody who doesn't want to do
[44:22] anything with your life so I make you
[44:26] question question everything about
[44:28] yourself so I'm going to continue making
[44:30] you question yourself by coming out here
[44:33] and being even more successful so I
[44:36] listen to that while I run I sometimes
[44:38] played in the house and it sometimes
[44:41] gets on Jennifer's [ __ ] nerves
[44:42] because I'm sitting and listen to
[44:43] Somebody talk mad [ __ ] on a loop about
[44:47] me and she's like why do you do this
[44:48] [ __ ] it's half comical and it's half um
[44:53] it's half inspiring I'm actually
[44:55] inspired by it I've heard you say
[44:57] previously that listening to music while
[44:59] you train is cheating MH so what you're
[45:01] telling me MH is that the Silence of
[45:04] your own dark thoughts isn't enough of a
[45:06] soundtrack and you've had to crowdsource
[45:09] insults from the internet self narrate
[45:12] it yep and then play it to yourself
[45:13] while you train that's it I do that
[45:16] sometimes yes yes have you got your
[45:18] phone on your right now I want to hear
[45:20] it no I I don't travel with my phone oh
[45:23] yeah my phone does not go with me
[45:25] anywhere why is that
[45:27] once again man like right now I'm with
[45:30] you a lot of times people are in
[45:33] conversations or they're somewhere they
[45:35] elsewhere you may think they're with you
[45:37] but they're not that phone is the
[45:39] biggest distraction in the world when
[45:41] time so when it comes time for the phone
[45:43] I'm on the phone when not I don't use it
[45:46] I'm all about being present where I'm at
[45:49] so that's why that phone right now no we
[45:51] do have it it's in your it's silenced
[45:53] it's off so I do have my phone right now
[45:55] but but usually I don't take it anywhere
[45:57] go got you so while you're listening to
[46:00] the self- narrated insults of random
[46:03] people on the internet that you don't
[46:04] like right what are you thinking of
[46:06] while you're listening to that while
[46:07] you're working out or while you're
[46:08] walking around the house how that back
[46:11] in the day when I was sometimes getting
[46:14] bullied or in a dark place how sometimes
[46:17] that would have bothered me how I would
[46:19] want
[46:20] to clap back I I would want to be on
[46:24] there all day explaining myself to
[46:26] people and how now I'm in a place now
[46:28] where I can hear it and I can actually
[46:30] enjoy it I can actually know where it's
[46:32] coming from I've studied it so I don't
[46:35] just like listen to it and like make fun
[46:37] of it I actually study it because I was
[46:39] once that negative person I was once
[46:42] that person who saw someone
[46:44] successful and didn't see how can I get
[46:47] there I was like oh [ __ ] that they're
[46:51] probably cheating or they're probably
[46:52] doing this I was I was that negative
[46:53] person because I wasn't there and I
[46:56] didn't want to work to get there so
[46:59] these people who hate on people I've
[47:01] studied them and I've gained a lot of
[47:04] Knowledge from them because I gain a lot
[47:05] of knowledge for myself when I was in
[47:06] that dark place so it's almost like
[47:09] reflecting an older version of you back
[47:11] to yourself 100% I had this idea um uh
[47:14] called the reverse role model so in a
[47:16] lot of places people might grow up and
[47:19] not have good Role Models around them
[47:21] you know like it would be great if I had
[47:23] someone that was my hero that could tell
[47:24] me how to be X uh good in school well
[47:29] with work fantastic in relationships
[47:30] whatever it might
[47:32] be and a lot of people don't grow up
[47:34] with that right and what I realized was
[47:36] cuz that was me in in part from where I
[47:39] was from but I realized there was a lot
[47:41] of people that I got to see that were
[47:43] like the sort of person I didn't want to
[47:44] be like right and that was the reverse
[47:46] role model so I could look around and I
[47:48] could say well I really don't want his
[47:50] relationship with his wife and I hate
[47:52] the way that he is using alcohol to get
[47:54] over the problems in his life he he
[47:57] doesn't have any Integrity or tell the
[47:58] truth she is a liar and a backstabber
[48:01] and a gossip and the thing is that you
[48:04] can actually achieve a lot of success in
[48:05] life by avoiding failure like most
[48:08] success in life actually is avoiding
[48:10] failure yes you need to be able to be
[48:12] competent But first you need to not get
[48:13] out of the race that's the one second
[48:15] decision right you need to not lose
[48:17] before you can win right and the reverse
[48:19] role model is you weaving your way
[48:22] through a selection of people that you
[48:23] don't want to be like and I think that
[48:25] you can get an awfully long way just by
[48:27] doing that I did that my entire life I
[48:30] had the ultimate blueprint by watching
[48:32] my family I was the youngest kid so the
[48:35] youngest kid has the total Advantage you
[48:38] know you may get picked on you may get
[48:39] bullied with everybody but you sit back
[48:42] in the exactly what you said I sat back
[48:44] and watched my dad definitely don't want
[48:46] to do that my mom my brother whoever it
[48:49] may be I sat back and I paid attention
[48:52] to everything around me and it was the
[48:55] ultimate blueprint to how to live life
[48:57] how not to live life how not to live
[48:59] life is I watched people do [ __ ] and I
[49:01] said
[49:02] H I don't want to be like that I like
[49:06] what you said about
[49:08] how the criticism that you see from
[49:10] people is coming from a very unique
[49:12] place I think if you got to see the
[49:15] inner texture of the people who don't
[49:16] like use existence you'd feel more pity
[49:19] than anger for the most part I think
[49:22] you'd pity them yes um and that's a
[49:24] realization that's taken a long time for
[49:27] me to to come up with because everybody
[49:30] else feels or to me it always seems like
[49:31] everyone else has got it together
[49:33] because I get to see only what you
[49:36] choose to say only what I'm around you
[49:39] doing that I get to see whereas I get to
[49:41] observe my
[49:42] own inefficiency and foibles 10,000
[49:46] times a second right I get to watch the
[49:48] texture of my own mind be completely
[49:50] unresponsive and useless I see every
[49:52] single um prideful decision every single
[49:55] lie that I tell myself every single time
[49:57] I make a promise and don't keep it mhm
[49:59] but I don't get to see that from
[50:00] everyone so I'd always presume because
[50:01] of this asymmetry that everybody else
[50:03] had it sorted and I didn't and it also
[50:05] made me think that everybody else's
[50:06] opinion was this perfectly balanced well
[50:09] researched beautifully it was it was
[50:13] they had they had me nailed down to a
[50:14] tea what they were telling me was the
[50:16] truth they could see something in me
[50:18] that I couldn't right and after a little
[50:21] bit of time and a good bit of building
[50:24] up of selfconfidence I realized that
[50:26] that's not the case no I have pity on a
[50:28] lot of people I do um I used to get
[50:32] angry about it like there was this guy I
[50:34] talked about it on on Rogan this guy
[50:36] from s team six who went out there when
[50:40] I became started becoming more famous he
[50:42] went out there and just try to destroy
[50:44] me tried to literally destroy me talked
[50:46] about how you know he just totally lied
[50:50] totally lied had to get a lawyer against
[50:52] him all all kind of [ __ ] and I was
[50:55] getting ready to Sue this guy had a
[50:56] great I was going to sue him because he
[50:58] literally tried to destroy my character
[51:01] my reputation went out there in this
[51:04] lest ass
[51:05] off I thought to
[51:07] myself it's about two months into it I
[51:10] sat back and I started feeling sorry for
[51:12] this guy like really sorry for him I was
[51:15] I was goingon to pull a trigger sue him
[51:16] and I said I'm not gonna Sue this guy I
[51:19] said for you to be this person who comes
[51:23] on and lies and tries to literally tear
[51:26] down
[51:27] everything I've worked for you are in a
[51:31] very very bad place come to find out he
[51:35] was in a very bad mental place so I get
[51:38] what you're saying I've learned to study
[51:41] people before I react because there's no
[51:44] successful person in the world who's in
[51:46] a good head space that's going to ever
[51:49] attack anyone in that kind of manner
[51:51] there's always going to be something
[51:53] wrong with them so you got to always
[51:55] dive a little deeper before you get your
[51:56] feelings hurt before you get your
[51:58] feelings hurt by that bully at school or
[52:02] that boss at work take time take that
[52:05] one second to pull back and study them
[52:09] because most people who are in good
[52:11] places they don't they don't care about
[52:13] what you're doing they don't care about
[52:15] what you're doing they don't try to
[52:16] destroy you they actually will try to
[52:18] build you up versus destroy who you are
[52:21] as a person so that's where I'm at now
[52:23] in life is most people who do that
[52:26] they're in a very dark dark place I've
[52:30] got a ton more to talk to goggin about
[52:31] but first I need to tell you about ag1
[52:33] you are not eating enough fruit and
[52:35] vegetables in your diet and you know it
[52:37] and this is going to help I've replaced
[52:39] a ton of multivitamins that I was taking

[52:43] athletic greens it covers all of my

[53:31] wisdom what do you think most people get
[53:33] wrong about
[53:35] motivation they think it's a permanent
[53:38] fix they think it's something that that
[53:43] is a constant they think that maybe once
[53:47] I get it I'm gonna hold on to
[53:49] it and that's the thing about that I was
[53:52] telling you I always talk about is
[53:55] nothing is permanent nothing is
[53:57] permanent and a lot of times you have to
[53:59] learn to perform without
[54:01] motivation you have to learn to perform
[54:03] without purpose you have to learn to
[54:05] perform a lot of different things and
[54:07] that's what people think they think I
[54:09] need to have this
[54:11] motivation to work out to study to be
[54:15] better so if they don't have it they
[54:17] just don't [ __ ] do it and that's
[54:19] where you
[54:20] fail you have to learn to train your
[54:23] mind well beyond motivation if you have
[54:27] motivation that's great that's some
[54:28] kindling to the fire all it takes is a
[54:31] little bit of [ __ ] spark you can burn
[54:32] a whole Forest up but motivation you
[54:36] have to learn to exist without it you
[54:38] have to learn to be you have to be your
[54:40] best self when you're least
[54:42] motivated and that's the tricky part
[54:44] about all that [ __ ] motivation is just a
[54:46] word you have to have these different
[54:48] things in your mind on where you want to
[54:50] go and know that motivation is not going
[54:52] to get me there CU I'm not going to
[54:54] always be motivated said the exact same
[54:57] thing you said that discipline needs
[54:58] motivation for breakfast and discipline
[55:01] is good too but without a clear head
[55:03] space there's no discipline what you
[55:05] mean so let's say we have a circuit
[55:09] breaker okay and I'm loading everything
[55:12] up to one [ __ ] circuit just load it
[55:15] up it's gonna [ __ ]
[55:18] blow and once that thing blows man the
[55:20] circuit's all [ __ ]
[55:22] up you got to have each thing plugged
[55:25] into the right SP spot like a [ __ ]
[55:28] crowded
[55:29] garage you can't put anything in it once
[55:31] your brain is crowded discipline is
[55:34] great motivation is great but if you
[55:37] can't fit [ __ ] in your brain because
[55:39] it's all [ __ ] cluttered with
[55:41] [ __ ] there's no
[55:44] discipline you may have it sometimes
[55:46] when it fits in that crowded garage of
[55:49] your mind but you don't have the
[55:51] consistency that you need to have with
[55:53] that discipline so what are you talking
[55:54] about here are you saying doing self
[55:56] work and reflecting on you as an
[55:57] individual are you doing therapy call I
[56:00] call it my I call it mental zones I
[56:02] don't get into it much because it be all
[56:04] day but basically is you're organizing
[56:08] your mind so you can put that discipline
[56:11] so a lot of people talk about discipline
[56:13] okay great why do you fall off the
[56:15] [ __ ] wagon why can't I continue with
[56:18] this routine going to the gym being
[56:21] better waking up early eating the right
[56:23] Foods it's because maybe it's your kids
[56:26] maybe it's your wife maybe it's your job
[56:29] and it's all just stuffed in your
[56:30] [ __ ] brain you don't have it
[56:32] compartmentalized and organized in these
[56:35] nice shelves like you look in a garage
[56:37] it's all [ __ ] a nice organized
[56:39] militant garage hey where are my
[56:41] dumbbells right there a lot of people
[56:44] whose brain Hey where's my Dum H let me
[56:46] look they're [ __ ] throwing [ __ ]
[56:48] they're looking through totes they're
[56:49] all [ __ ] up so where am I going to put
[56:52] discipline in that mind if I can't find
[56:55] other [ __ ]
[56:57] you got to be able to find all these
[56:58] different things in your mind oh I can
[57:01] put discipline right there I can put
[57:04] consistency right there I can put all
[57:06] these things right there in that spot so
[57:08] that's what I'm talking about if your
[57:10] life is not
[57:11] organized in your life being everything
[57:15] around you because it takes one little
[57:19] [ __ ] up piece of an outside
[57:21] interference to Cutter your whole mind
[57:24] because it's on such a knife edge that's
[57:26] right and people don't get that your
[57:28] mind has to always be clear that's why
[57:31] Mo that's why I meditate two hours every
[57:34] single night because I refresh I
[57:37] reorganize the garage which is my mind
[57:40] every night so then discipline's in
[57:43] there organization everything is in this
[57:46] right spot so when I wake up I'm ready
[57:48] to go what does a morning look like for
[57:50] you at the moment have you got a routine
[57:51] of some kind yes I run every single
[57:53] morning so that's what time you up when
[57:55] are you waking up I'm up about 5 5:30 so
[57:59] every morning starts with a run and
[58:01] that's because that's the one thing I
[58:03] hate to do more than anything in the
[58:05] world so that's like my cup of coffee
[58:08] and I'm all about armoring yourself so
[58:12] the second you leave your house and the
[58:14] second you open your phone the second
[58:17] you do any of that [ __ ] you are now
[58:19] letting them poison in
[58:21] cancer so I make sure a lot of things
[58:24] you can't avoid so as I get up I start
[58:28] to armor plate my mind and body like a
[58:31] person's going to war you put your body
[58:33] armor on that's what I'm doing on that
[58:35] run I'm waking up and I'm giving myself
[58:38] all this armor so when I come out in the
[58:41] world now look at that phone I'm ready
[58:44] I'm not waking up late I'm not rushing
[58:46] around I'm not disorganized because I
[58:48] know I'm gonna get hit in the [ __ ]
[58:50] mouth there's a there's an art to
[58:51] getting hit in the [ __ ]
[58:52] mouth and that is why these things are
[58:56] important you have to wake up and you
[58:58] have to give yourself belief you have to
[59:00] give yourself confidence so that it
[59:02] starts with that run so after the run I
[59:05] come home I eat something small how
[59:07] long's the Run typically at the moment
[59:09] nowhere Under 12 miles so 12 miles is
[59:13] the minimum and what are you getting
[59:14] that done in how long it depends right
[59:17] now I'm running a heart rate so I'm
[59:18] running like 815s 830s cuz I'm
[59:21] retraining right now because is that
[59:23] zone two for you zone two because of the
[59:25] leg I had so I'm going back starting
[59:28] from scratch so anywhere from about an
[59:31] hour 30 to two hours I run every day mhm
[59:34] so that's so you're fasted on the
[59:35] morning up straight out straight out 90
[59:38] minutes to two hours of running back eat
[59:40] eat and I'm in the gym so and then after
[59:44] that um to whatever's on the plan for
[59:47] the day that's how that works every day
[59:50] are you still doing your stretching cuz
[59:51] you've got two hours of you've got two
[59:53] hours of meditation 90 minutes to 2 of
[59:56] running MH how long's the gym session
[59:58] depends 45 to an hour and a half okay
[01:00:02] mhm stretching meditation run M
[01:00:06] eat gy
[01:00:08] M what is that my missing Jennifer oh
[01:00:12] yeah yeah forgot about that you cycle as
[01:00:15] well yeah how long are you cycling it
[01:00:17] just depends I do stationary bike right
[01:00:18] now a lot uhuh what do youing is it like
[01:00:20] a wat bike or something similar yeah
[01:00:22] something similar so I put my bike on a
[01:00:24] uh like trainer M and I cycle yep at
[01:00:27] least three or four days a week I'll do
[01:00:29] that
[01:00:31] so that's your day there's no there's
[01:00:33] there is no room for anything
[01:00:35] else yeah there is a lot of room so
[01:00:38] there's 24 hours and I and I use it all
[01:00:40] pretty pretty well how's your sleep
[01:00:42] what's your sleep L it's really good
[01:00:44] okay getting eight hours is something
[01:00:46] like that seven eight hours mhm yeah
[01:00:48] well you need to with this sort of
[01:00:49] volume 78 hours and you're still doing
[01:00:51] your stretching stuff every night so
[01:00:54] you've got a 4H hour block basically of
[01:00:55] stretching meditation that's all in one
[01:00:57] block you combine the two right yeah
[01:00:58] that's all in one block cool yep that's
[01:01:01] one hell of a day it is and it's been
[01:01:03] like that for seven years but going back
[01:01:06] to what you said before about needing to
[01:01:07] cap success MH you wouldn't be able to
[01:01:10] fit even one tenth of that in exactly if
[01:01:14] you were chasing down exactly yep that's
[01:01:17] exactly it so if all that's [ __ ] up
[01:01:21] that's why I got a cap success because I
[01:01:23] can't put that in and and that's my
[01:01:26] growth factor so you know that's that's
[01:01:29] my human growth factor you said before
[01:01:32] about um how you build up self-esteem
[01:01:35] and confidence and stuff and there's
[01:01:37] this quote from one of my friends Alex
[01:01:38] hosi that says you don't become
[01:01:40] Confident by shouting affirmations in
[01:01:42] the mirror but by having a stack of
[01:01:44] undeniable proof that you are who you
[01:01:45] say you are outwork your self-doubt yes
[01:01:49] that's that's nailed nailed completely
[01:01:52] nailed yes because a lot of people will
[01:01:55] in some of these motiv ation people out
[01:01:56] here it's It's the funniest thing in the
[01:01:58] world to me they'll go and say when you
[01:02:00] wake up in the morning pound your chest
[01:02:03] you know [ __ ] look at yourself in the
[01:02:04] mirror and do all this [ __ ] [ __ ]
[01:02:07] I hope it works what works for me is
[01:02:10] that everyday resume the things I know
[01:02:13] I've accomplished the things I know I've
[01:02:14] done real hard work the real calluses on
[01:02:18] my mind the real calluses on my hands
[01:02:20] that's that's it that you don't need to
[01:02:23] pound your chest in the mirror of the
[01:02:24] [ __ ] anymore if you have that it seems
[01:02:26] like especially with confidence right or
[01:02:28] self-esteem there's a relationship
[01:02:30] between confidence and competence so
[01:02:32] what you're looking to do is try and
[01:02:33] have what you believe that you can do be
[01:02:36] ahead of what you can do now you're not
[01:02:38] looking for it to be delusional you
[01:02:40] don't want it to to be able to believe
[01:02:41] that you can do something like fly right
[01:02:44] but you need to have a relationship
[01:02:45] between the two but what people are
[01:02:46] asking for is for their confidence to be
[01:02:48] so far ahead of their competence that or
[01:02:50] without having even been competent at
[01:02:52] anything in the beginning and that's
[01:02:53] just delusion that's fantasy right well
[01:02:55] I believe that you have to build
[01:02:57] belief belief is like there's an after
[01:03:00] school special belief where the mom says
[01:03:04] believe in yourself and that's all great
[01:03:07] but there's also a built belief and the
[01:03:09] built belief is one where you are
[01:03:12] constantly like for me I came from a bad
[01:03:15] place How I build belief is through the
[01:03:19] the daunting tasks I put myself through
[01:03:22] so that's proof positive that I can't
[01:03:27] so it correlates and that's how this
[01:03:30] piece of [ __ ] kid I once thought I was
[01:03:33] built belief by saying hm I was in three
[01:03:36] hell weeks I went to Ranger school I
[01:03:39] tried out for Delta selection undeniable
[01:03:41] stock of proof that is proof
[01:03:43] [ __ ] so whenever you think
[01:03:45] whenever you think you can't confidence
[01:03:48] comes from the thing that you built you
[01:03:51] must build belief you must build
[01:03:54] confidence it can't be like he um I'm
[01:03:57] going go knock that [ __ ] out you got to
[01:04:00] look over here and say I can knock that
[01:04:04] [ __ ] out it's belief and it's built on
[01:04:07] what you put in to yourself another
[01:04:10] friend sent me a a message this morning
[01:04:12] knowing that we had this this big thing
[01:04:13] that we've working toward for a long
[01:04:15] time today he said uh nature said I know
[01:04:18] of no better life purpose than to perish
[01:04:20] in attempting the great and impossible
[01:04:22] the fact that something seems impossible
[01:04:24] shouldn't be a reason to not pursue it
[01:04:26] that's exactly what makes it worth
[01:04:27] pursuing where would the courage and
[01:04:29] greatness be if success was certain and
[01:04:32] there was no risk the only true failure
[01:04:34] is shrinking away from life's challenges
[01:04:36] na that one also two for two na that one
[01:04:39] also man yeah it's that um it's that
[01:04:43] dealing with laziness and self-doubt
[01:04:45] thing I think
[01:04:47] uh and I do wonder how many people use
[01:04:50] the look in the mirror pound the chest
[01:04:53] stare into your eyes say your
[01:04:54] affirmations don't get the results and
[01:04:57] then lose
[01:04:59] confidence well that's part of it a lot
[01:05:01] of it is limit to
[01:05:03] Horizons limited Horizons are like I use
[01:05:06] me as an example
[01:05:07] always I came from a small town in
[01:05:12] Indiana where there was a handful of
[01:05:15] black
[01:05:16] families and a lot of people in that
[01:05:19] town when you come from a town of 8,000
[01:05:22] people it's like we had a local plant
[01:05:26] Great Dane you're like you know what I
[01:05:28] want to work at Great Dane and get a
[01:05:31] house next to my mom that's what you
[01:05:33] know so many of us come from these small
[01:05:38] places in our mind that we're not
[01:05:40] willing to think outside of only what
[01:05:44] we've seen our mind works in such a
[01:05:47] small
[01:05:48] compartment and one thing I was able to
[01:05:50] do was to dream many people but don't
[01:05:54] make dreams your [ __ ] m
[01:05:56] Master but I was able to dream outside
[01:06:00] those [ __ ] Four Walls of that small
[01:06:02] town and until you're able to really put
[01:06:06] yourself into that dream but don't make
[01:06:09] dreams your master that's where you
[01:06:11] truly become what you're destined to
[01:06:14] become what you mean don't make dreams
[01:06:16] your master a lot of people sit back and
[01:06:18] they dream about being a sports figure
[01:06:22] or dream about being a seal or dream
[01:06:24] about being an astronaut all it is is a
[01:06:26] [ __ ] dream they don't put the
[01:06:28] work behind the dream that dream has
[01:06:30] become their [ __ ] Master when you
[01:06:33] become the master of your [ __ ] dream
[01:06:36] is when you say I want to go be a Navy
[01:06:37] SEAL and you say okay I'm gonna lose 106
[01:06:40] pounds and less than three [ __ ]
[01:06:42] months the dream was the one thing I
[01:06:45] thought about and the dream was now gone
[01:06:48] now what comes in the dream goes away
[01:06:51] and the [ __ ] laundry list of [ __ ]
[01:06:53] details and tasks come up got do this
[01:06:55] gotta do this gotta do this gotta do
[01:06:57] this that's when you become the master
[01:06:59] of your dream so a lot of people out
[01:07:01] there dreaming Ryan holiday says talking
[01:07:04] about the thing and doing the thing V
[01:07:06] for the same resources allocate yours
[01:07:08] appropriately that's it that's it that's
[01:07:12] the way it works as well that's the way
[01:07:13] that the brain works you can actually
[01:07:14] get these kicks of dopamine by telling
[01:07:16] your friends about I'm going to be a
[01:07:17] Navy SEAL I'm going to start my training
[01:07:18] next week it's going to be great I'm
[01:07:19] gonna feel like this feels good it feels
[01:07:22] good to talk about that [ __ ] man it
[01:07:23] actually makes you feel good makes you
[01:07:25] feel proud all that [ __ ] but guess what
[01:07:28] happens that alarm clock goes off at
[01:07:29] 4:00 am. to
[01:07:31] train I want to be a seal today or I
[01:07:34] don't want to be whatever today I'll
[01:07:36] start tomorrow and that's the usual
[01:07:39] pattern of people's lives that's why I
[01:07:43] talk about clearing out the mind until
[01:07:45] you really want to do something you're
[01:07:48] always G to be a talker you always get
[01:07:50] run your [ __ ] mouth so again with the
[01:07:54] audio version of this book you've done
[01:07:56] podcasts in between each chapter where
[01:07:58] you're recapping what's just happened
[01:08:01] and this time you brought guests one of
[01:08:03] which was your mother right and you
[01:08:05] spend a 35 minute conversation sitting
[01:08:08] down with her and talking about the
[01:08:09] experiences that she had with your
[01:08:12] father and reflecting on that right a
[01:08:15] lot of stuff you'd elected to leave out
[01:08:18] of the first book so that means there's
[01:08:19] been a journey that you've gone through
[01:08:21] to get to the stage where both you and
[01:08:24] her and collaboratively you felt okay
[01:08:26] sharing that publicly right like what's
[01:08:29] that process like CU your mom didn't ask
[01:08:32] for this I mean you kind of also did you
[01:08:34] put a book out there because you thought
[01:08:35] it was useful and now millions and
[01:08:36] millions of people know about you but
[01:08:38] right you know the uh gravity field of
[01:08:41] your notoriety is starting to bring
[01:08:43] other people in as well so what was the
[01:08:44] Journey of getting to that stage like
[01:08:46] well it wasn't so much me I had already
[01:08:49] laid out you know a lot of [ __ ] about me
[01:08:51] that was you know pretty embarrassing
[01:08:53] and can't hurt me so for her her that
[01:08:56] actually helped her out she said wow if
[01:08:58] you had the courage to go out there and
[01:09:00] tell people all your [ __ ] you know and
[01:09:03] so that process was it it took about
[01:09:05] four years of me working with my mom
[01:09:08] because you know she was very damaged by
[01:09:12] what she went through and so was I but I
[01:09:15] knew no one was coming to save me so I
[01:09:16] had to go ahead and fix my [ __ ] and she
[01:09:19] kind of lived in a different place but
[01:09:22] when I wrote can't hurt me it started
[01:09:24] waking her up
[01:09:25] that hey man why do you care why do you
[01:09:29] care so much what people think about you
[01:09:31] what you went through why why are you
[01:09:32] putting so much so much on other people
[01:09:36] and what they may say about you like
[01:09:38] there's some stuff I talk about you know
[01:09:41] that is pretty embarrassing for some
[01:09:44] people but she got to a point in her
[01:09:46] life where she was able to you know stop
[01:09:48] caring because we all have our [ __ ] no
[01:09:51] one that like people it's so funny to me
[01:09:53] there be people who are out here
[01:09:55] commentating about people who are
[01:09:56] [ __ ] up out here famous people are
[01:09:58] [ __ ] up and I don't know how they're
[01:10:01] able to do that when I guarantee while
[01:10:05] your skeletons are not being out there
[01:10:08] if I were to open up your [ __ ] door
[01:10:10] [ __ ] how how how are you doing
[01:10:13] that so I know that about everybody like
[01:10:17] people love to talk [ __ ] about somebody
[01:10:19] and keep themselves out of it and so we
[01:10:22] went through that journey together and
[01:10:24] so it allowed her to come out and say
[01:10:26] yeah [ __ ] it you know I'm I'm a big
[01:10:28] person who I want to get people to
[01:10:30] confidence to walk in the room of a
[01:10:32] million people and none of them like you
[01:10:35] and you just like say [ __ ] you I'm good
[01:10:38] and walk out with you by yourself you
[01:10:41] helped your mom do that as well and now
[01:10:42] she can look at everybody and say yeah I
[01:10:45] [ __ ] married a [ __ ] that
[01:10:46] choked the woman to death I was in a bad
[01:10:51] place I'm good with
[01:10:53] that one of the days that you focus on a
[01:10:57] good bit in that conversation is the day
[01:10:58] that she decided to leave your father
[01:11:00] right and take you and your brother with
[01:11:03] her MH was there anything that you
[01:11:05] learned about upon reflection MH where
[01:11:09] both of your experiences uh opened up a
[01:11:12] new realization to
[01:11:14] you that that was a hard time for her
[01:11:17] and for me also I was ready to leave a
[01:11:19] long time ago I was just waiting for her
[01:11:21] to get the courage to finally leave him
[01:11:23] and um
[01:11:26] I don't think anything from that
[01:11:29] really I think that's where the damage
[01:11:31] really began I think for her when she
[01:11:34] left it almost her
[01:11:37] fight went away and it's kind of like
[01:11:41] when you run 100 miles when you sit down
[01:11:45] your body can then say exactly what I
[01:11:46] was thinking I'm done exactly what I was
[01:11:48] thinking the second she
[01:11:52] left that the Mind said oh my God
[01:11:55] like we can we can be human it's like
[01:11:58] PTSD yes we can be human and we're not
[01:12:02] fighting anymore and it just swarmed the
[01:12:07] demons that all that fight and all that
[01:12:09] [ __ ] was keeping away it just came and
[01:12:12] it swallowed it swallowed her whole and
[01:12:14] it also swallowed me whole but once
[01:12:16] again like we're were talking about I
[01:12:17] got a chance to watch
[01:12:19] her and she set out the ultimate
[01:12:23] blueprint on how not to be
[01:12:26] so I had a hard time learning growing up
[01:12:29] but I was very smart when it came to
[01:12:30] human beings a genius because I lived in
[01:12:35] such hell I was always studying people
[01:12:38] who can I trust who can I not trust
[01:12:40] energy I I got really good with energy
[01:12:43] can I is this person's energy good is it
[01:12:45] bad so I became a genius on human beings
[01:12:50] so I studied people all the time studied
[01:12:53] all the time she also talks about
[01:12:56] considering taking her own life oh yeah
[01:12:58] were you aware of that before you
[01:13:00] started working toward this book yeah so
[01:13:02] yeah she she talked about that a few
[01:13:04] times with me you know behind closed
[01:13:05] doors and um I'm I'm I'm I'm surprised
[01:13:09] she didn't you know there's a lot of
[01:13:12] stories that are still ont told that she
[01:13:14] probably will never talk about and I'll
[01:13:17] never talk about them until she says
[01:13:19] it's fine but um yeah it was it was a
[01:13:22] bad it was it was a bad way so I I I
[01:13:25] give her credit for having the strength
[01:13:26] to say okay I need to continue on and
[01:13:29] figure out you know what's next for me
[01:13:31] which she says the only reason that she
[01:13:32] didn't go through with it is because of
[01:13:34] you and your brother because she knew
[01:13:36] that she would be leaving you in the
[01:13:38] hands of this Tyrant that was going to
[01:13:40] mistreat you even more badly now that
[01:13:43] she wasn't around to protect you yeah
[01:13:45] which is a it's beautiful but it's also
[01:13:47] kind of a lot of pressure it feels like
[01:13:49] a lot of pressure for a child to be the
[01:13:51] reason for his mother to to still be
[01:13:53] there and it's also a damning conclusion
[01:13:57] about the state of her life right that
[01:13:59] the only thing stopping you from taking
[01:14:01] your own life is these two boys but it's
[01:14:06] also beautiful in a way because a lot of
[01:14:09] people only have one
[01:14:12] thing you don't need a lot of things
[01:14:15] sometimes only thing that kept me with
[01:14:17] that one step forward was one thing and
[01:14:20] so that one thing can get you to two
[01:14:23] things to three things to four things so
[01:14:25] that was the beautiful thing about that
[01:14:27] is that now she's 75 and she's retired
[01:14:30] because of that one
[01:14:31] thing
[01:14:33] how I mean you you're having this
[01:14:35] conversation with your mom during the
[01:14:38] production of the audio
[01:14:39] book you're having a conversation which
[01:14:41] is difficult to have in private right
[01:14:44] with two microphones in front of you
[01:14:46] knowing full well that this is going out
[01:14:48] to millions of people it's going to be
[01:14:49] scrutinized it's going to be listened to
[01:14:51] it's going to be reflected on Y how
[01:14:53] difficult is it to watch your mother
[01:14:56] opening up about an experience which to
[01:14:57] you was traumatic and then reopening
[01:15:00] those wounds in front of you and talking
[01:15:02] about that for millions of people to
[01:15:04] hear oh it's it's hard it's hard
[01:15:09] but it's
[01:15:11] necessary why to be able to own your
[01:15:15] trauma to be able to own everything
[01:15:17] about you and look it in the
[01:15:20] eye like there's a part in Eight Mile
[01:15:24] with Eminem the very end when this white
[01:15:28] boy you know [ __ ] trying to make it
[01:15:30] in the rap world and getting beat down
[01:15:33] and [ __ ] comes from some trailer park
[01:15:35] [ __ ] and he's like how the [ __ ] am I GNA
[01:15:40] win this rap battle because my best
[01:15:42] friend got shot in the foot and this
[01:15:45] dude slept with my girl and all this
[01:15:47] [ __ ] so what he does to take all the
[01:15:49] power from the [ __ ] gonna rap
[01:15:51] battle his ass he's
[01:15:53] like I'm going to tell you every
[01:15:56] [ __ ] thing about me I'm just
[01:15:59] going to [ __ ] tell you and that's how
[01:16:01] I feel about life and that's how my mom
[01:16:04] now feels about life I'm just gonna
[01:16:07] [ __ ] tell you everything a [ __ ]
[01:16:08] about me I'm not gonna hide I'm not
[01:16:11] gonna do none of this [ __ ] and it's a
[01:16:12] refreshing feeling when you can get in
[01:16:14] front of millions of people get
[01:16:16] audiobook and you can go through your
[01:16:18] [ __ ] and lay it out and you walk away
[01:16:21] there's no more secrets there's no more
[01:16:23] secrets like when people say oh hey
[01:16:26] Lance Armstrong did you do steroids no
[01:16:28] no no
[01:16:32] yes while I have nothing I have nothing
[01:16:35] wrong with Lance Armstrong or anybody
[01:16:36] else just [ __ ] tell the [ __ ]
[01:16:39] man and guess what happens to the
[01:16:41] conversation it's over it [ __ ] ends
[01:16:45] there's a really telling Moment In the
[01:16:47] book I think it's my favorite part and
[01:16:48] it's not even in this one it's in the
[01:16:50] audio book and it's when it's getting
[01:16:53] quite difficult with your mom mhm and
[01:16:56] you offer her a root out you ask if she
[01:16:58] wants to take a break y she says no I
[01:17:01] want to keep going so it seems like
[01:17:03] she's got a bit of that dog in her as
[01:17:04] well oh yeah she had to yeah she had to
[01:17:08] one one thing that when you grow up the
[01:17:10] way we kind of grew up together that's
[01:17:12] how I look at it when you grew up when
[01:17:14] she had you and she had J 28 and my
[01:17:18] brother at 24 so um after that you know
[01:17:22] we grew up together and you got to have
[01:17:24] a dog you you have to have a dog in you
[01:17:27] man and so you have to have like like my
[01:17:30] grandfather called it a stiff upper lip
[01:17:32] you better have a stiff upper lip so you
[01:17:35] know yeah she has some dog in her she
[01:17:37] has some dog in her she has to there's
[01:17:39] no other way to make it out here I mean
[01:17:42] you can't just always be you know head
[01:17:45] down in the sand you gotta learn to pick
[01:17:47] yourself up on your own a lot of times
[01:17:49] these fights and these battles you got
[01:17:51] to be your own [ __ ] coach you got to
[01:17:52] be your own motivator and she had do
[01:17:55] that several times in her life given all
[01:17:57] of this trauma that you go through why
[01:18:00] would you choose to go back and see this
[01:18:02] Tyrant of a father for one last time it
[01:18:05] was the only way for me to move
[01:18:07] forward so like a lot of
[01:18:10] times if your back is hurting it may not
[01:18:13] be your [ __ ] back it may be something
[01:18:15] else in your body that's making your
[01:18:16] back hurt for
[01:18:18] me I'm like man why can't I get past
[01:18:22] this [ __ ] hurdle so like I said I'm
[01:18:24] always is examining myself every day
[01:18:27] what is it what is it well there's only
[01:18:30] one thing you haven't examined yet and
[01:18:32] it's going back to the Beast going back
[01:18:34] to the demon so when I went back to him
[01:18:37] I realized that that was the unsolved
[01:18:40] mystery was I had to look that man the
[01:18:43] eye one more
[01:18:45] time like how I studied the that Navy
[01:18:48] SEAL talking [ __ ] and lion I got it from
[01:18:50] this part right here in the book I went
[01:18:53] and I didn't see him any any more as
[01:18:55] this
[01:18:56] Beast I started doing research on him
[01:19:00] found out that his dad used to beat him
[01:19:02] really bad so my his his dad would put
[01:19:05] him in front of a
[01:19:07] furnace open the furnace up with the
[01:19:09] Flames coming out and put him right in
[01:19:11] front of it have him bare but naked and
[01:19:16] he would whip the [ __ ] out of him and
[01:19:18] the whole idea of that is if you move
[01:19:21] you're going to get burned so stay right
[01:19:23] here and take your [ __ ] beat
[01:19:25] so what happened with
[01:19:27] him those demons from his father went to
[01:19:30] my father and he tried to transfer him
[01:19:33] over to me I had to understand who my
[01:19:36] father was understand where he came from
[01:19:38] understand why were you so [ __ ]
[01:19:41] brutal to
[01:19:42] us I got my answers took those answers
[01:19:46] and made myself better from the ansers
[01:19:49] about him and so that's why it was
[01:19:52] necessary for me to go back not I was
[01:19:54] looking for an AP ology so then maybe I
[01:19:56] could just go be a loser and understand
[01:19:58] that you [ __ ] me up why would the
[01:20:00] apology make you a loser it would make
[01:20:03] no it would make me feel Vindicated
[01:20:06] Justified yes like man you you did this
[01:20:09] to me I can go be a loser now my
[01:20:12] failings are okay this okay yep because
[01:20:15] you did this so I was looking for that
[01:20:18] and when I went there I I realized
[01:20:19] because his voice in him was saying it's
[01:20:21] not your dad's
[01:20:22] fault and I'm like n a man because this
[01:20:26] voice over here always said it's your
[01:20:28] dad's fault this other voice started
[01:20:30] tuning in was loud started getting
[01:20:32] louder the more I drove to Buffalo was
[01:20:34] saying you got to face a lot of [ __ ]
[01:20:37] young man you got a long journey ahead
[01:20:39] of you because you're gonna find out
[01:20:41] that while your dad did a lot of [ __ ] to
[01:20:43] you you're gonna have to [ __ ] make it
[01:20:45] on your own and the voice got louder and
[01:20:48] louder and louder and by time I got to
[01:20:51] that door and by time I was leaving that
[01:20:53] house instead of me feeling sorry for
[01:20:55] myself I started to doing live
[01:20:58] autopsy because a lot of people when you
[01:21:02] die they figure out why you died they
[01:21:04] figure out how you died in the
[01:21:07] autopsy but we never do live autopsy to
[01:21:10] figure out why we're dying while we are
[01:21:13] alive and I was dying I was living every
[01:21:15] day but I was really dead and so I
[01:21:18] figured it out and once I figured it out
[01:21:21] I was able to reborn I was able to be
[01:21:24] reborn
[01:21:26] what we see is this pattern of
[01:21:28] generational trauma your grandfather to
[01:21:31] your father your father to you father to
[01:21:33] son just being passed on passed on
[01:21:35] passed on is this part of your mission
[01:21:39] to be a circuit breaker to be a a dam to
[01:21:43] stop this Trauma from moving forward
[01:21:45] into the Next Generation 100% but with
[01:21:49] people I'm trying to build people up I'm
[01:21:52] trying to armor their mind I'm trying to
[01:21:54] get the the belief because this world we
[01:21:56] live in is tough it's tough it will beat
[01:21:59] you down the world and the life that we
[01:22:02] live in is the ultimate competitor it
[01:22:04] will try to take you out it will it will
[01:22:06] find your
[01:22:07] weakness and it will [ __ ] just Hammer
[01:22:10] you it's like a personal curse 100% so
[01:22:13] if I can help you build belief build
[01:22:17] confidence to the point
[01:22:19] where nothing can hurt you because you
[01:22:22] know exactly who you are you've faced
[01:22:25] your demons you've you've been able to
[01:22:27] go on an audio book in your mind maybe
[01:22:30] you didn't write a book but in your mind
[01:22:32] you were able to hear all your past
[01:22:34] traumas you were able to listen to them
[01:22:37] you're able to [ __ ] say okay now I
[01:22:39] can now talk to people about what I went
[01:22:41] through I'm no longer embarrassed I'm no
[01:22:43] longer ashamed being ashamed is one of
[01:22:45] the biggest things that kill people
[01:22:46] nowadays in their minds kill them from
[01:22:48] moving forward I'm ashamed of
[01:22:50] myself don't ever be ashamed of anything
[01:22:53] you've done in your life face it fix it
[01:22:55] make it
[01:22:56] better we are
[01:22:59] humans but then again if you always
[01:23:01] think that we're humans you will always
[01:23:04] just be a human and always make the same
[01:23:06] [ __ ]
[01:23:07] mistakes you must take this knowledge
[01:23:10] that you learn from all this [ __ ] is
[01:23:12] knowledge so I'm just trying to give
[01:23:14] people that strength to go in the
[01:23:16] archives of your life because while
[01:23:19] you're probably [ __ ] up it's probably
[01:23:20] something happened to you in your life
[01:23:22] go through the archives dig it up
[01:23:24] study it and then use it for yourself
[01:23:28] that's that's the main purpose for me
[01:23:30] right now have you considered what you
[01:23:31] would be like as a
[01:23:33] father yeah I actually have a daughter
[01:23:36] right
[01:23:36] now yeah no way I didn't know yeah I
[01:23:40] have a daughter right now but that being
[01:23:42] said I'm an open honest person when you
[01:23:46] meet people at a young age so I had a
[01:23:49] kid at a young age when I was in the
[01:23:52] worst possible place in my life
[01:23:55] so when you're in a bad place you're not
[01:23:57] going to meet a
[01:24:00] Kish you're going to meet a person
[01:24:02] that's very similar to who you are at
[01:24:04] that time and then you bring a child
[01:24:07] into this world and as you start to move
[01:24:10] up in this world and get better and you
[01:24:12] realize I need to get better you try to
[01:24:15] pull that person along with you a lot of
[01:24:19] times they don't want to come where
[01:24:20] you're going and it creates a bad
[01:24:23] environment
[01:24:25] so that's where that is right
[01:24:28] now talking but my daughter's 21 years
[01:24:30] old though wow yeah I'm glad to hear
[01:24:33] that I think I I think that uh it would
[01:24:37] be all of the learnings and stuff that
[01:24:39] you've been through as a father as a son
[01:24:42] as a grandson um it makes sense to me
[01:24:46] that that would have been a something
[01:24:48] that could have been passed down mhm so
[01:24:51] thinking about uh trauma and stuff that
[01:24:54] you go through in your past um
[01:24:58] throughout most of school for me I was
[01:24:59] pretty isolated only child uh pretty
[01:25:01] unpopular in school and the main issue
[01:25:04] that I had
[01:25:05] was it wasn't bullying it was isolation
[01:25:08] I think it was being lonely right um and
[01:25:11] that was primarily what was causing me
[01:25:14] to be sad throughout school right so I
[01:25:17] do this interview for the BBC about six
[01:25:20] months ago and uh in it I talk about I
[01:25:22] haven't opened up that much about
[01:25:23] bullying I I need to to do it more and
[01:25:25] it is you know even from watching you go
[01:25:27] through opening up about your traumas it
[01:25:29] is inspiring uh so I do this interview
[01:25:31] for the BBC and I mention a little bit
[01:25:32] about bullying in school and so why
[01:25:35] don't you mention
[01:25:36] it I haven't got around to it yet I I
[01:25:39] maybe still feel like
[01:25:42] it detracts from the man that I want to
[01:25:45] be the masculine man the um respected
[01:25:49] podcaster that it somehow undermines me
[01:25:53] as a person that it makes me weaker
[01:25:55] which is obviously what was you know
[01:25:56] part of the bullying's purpose in school
[01:25:59] to be able to do precisely that right so
[01:26:01] I do this interview for the BBC and I
[01:26:03] mentioned in two paragraphs or something
[01:26:05] but millions of people see this article
[01:26:07] uh and I get back one day and in my
[01:26:10] Instagram message requests is this
[01:26:12] message from a guy and I kind of
[01:26:14] recognize his name but not not fully and
[01:26:17] I don't know whether you know but
[01:26:17] there's like a character limit in
[01:26:19] Instagram so and this is five character
[01:26:23] limit messages long with multiple
[01:26:26] paragraphs within each of them right so
[01:26:28] I open it up uh and this guy says uh hi
[01:26:32] Chris you might not remember me but we
[01:26:34] went to school together uh I bullied
[01:26:37] you my daughter is four and she's about
[01:26:41] to go to school and given that she's
[01:26:43] about to go to school me and my wife
[01:26:44] have been discussing about the kind of
[01:26:45] child that we want her to be and that
[01:26:47] caused me to reflect on my time that I
[01:26:49] spent in
[01:26:50] school I saw I've been thinking about
[01:26:53] messaging you for a while I've been
[01:26:55] considering talking to you uh because I
[01:26:57] really felt like I needed to because I
[01:26:58] felt ashamed of the way that I treated
[01:27:01] you in school and I knew that it had
[01:27:02] hurt you uh and then I saw this article
[01:27:05] from the BBC and I just had to reach out
[01:27:09] and I've been sleepless nights speaking
[01:27:12] to the wife tears and all the rest of it
[01:27:16] uh and I just wanted to say that I'm
[01:27:17] sorry uh I'm very sorry for what I did
[01:27:20] um I wanted to let you know that my
[01:27:23] daughter
[01:27:24] is going to be raised in a way that will
[01:27:26] never treat anybody like that again um I
[01:27:29] don't expect you to forgive me I don't
[01:27:31] even know if you'll see this message I'm
[01:27:32] happy to see that you seem to be happy
[01:27:35] um but I I needed to get it off my chest
[01:27:39] right I'm like [ __ ] totally taken a back
[01:27:43] like wasn't prepared for this I have
[01:27:45] come back in from the gym or something
[01:27:46] and I'm sat reading this message like
[01:27:47] [ __ ] hell that's heavy so I go back
[01:27:50] through and I think well how do I feel
[01:27:52] about this how do I feel about this
[01:27:53] person how do I feel about my experience
[01:27:55] right um because it was so formative
[01:27:57] right it shaped so much of the way that
[01:27:59] I see myself the way that I see the
[01:28:01] world I had to
[01:28:04] deprogram so much of the patterns that
[01:28:07] I'd learned right through that time um
[01:28:11] my desire for validation from other
[01:28:13] people right U my need to be liked my
[01:28:15] constant vigilance my ambient anxiety
[01:28:18] that was always looking for what was
[01:28:19] going on my concern of being left out y
[01:28:22] my adamant uh that everybody was um able
[01:28:26] to judge something about me that I
[01:28:28] didn't know about myself
[01:28:30] y but this guy had like fully fully
[01:28:34] opened up to me and I thought well you
[01:28:37] know it was beautiful it was a beautiful
[01:28:39] message um so I replied to him and I
[01:28:41] said hey man um I very much appreciate
[01:28:44] you reaching out I think it's an
[01:28:46] incredibly Brave thing to do and
[01:28:51] if me going through what I went through
[01:28:54] and then the pain and discomfort and
[01:28:56] such and your subsequent suffering of
[01:28:59] reflecting on what you did MH if that
[01:29:02] has led to a world in which your
[01:29:05] daughter will be the sort of person who
[01:29:09] will behave in a manner that's going to
[01:29:11] make the world a better place going
[01:29:13] forward I think that's a price that's
[01:29:15] worth paying that's awesome man that's
[01:29:18] that's a great story that's a great
[01:29:20] story and you're the you're the expert
[01:29:23] on it
[01:29:24] that's why you should talk about
[01:29:26] bullying I know yeah you're the expert
[01:29:29] and that's why I do it you know um
[01:29:33] that's why I become I i' I've become so
[01:29:36] vulnerable because all that knowledge
[01:29:38] you gain because now you are
[01:29:40] successful and there's so many people
[01:29:42] who are getting bullied in so many
[01:29:44] ways that you know you just show them
[01:29:48] that there's a path but the path is
[01:29:51] really like I talk about studying the
[01:29:54] the
[01:29:54] bully that's the path studying the bully
[01:29:58] were you ever tempted to become a bully
[01:30:01] never never I'm always like I said like
[01:30:04] I told you before this started I wanted
[01:30:05] to be a priest I want to be a priest you
[01:30:08] know and um could you imagine one of
[01:30:10] those sermons oh it'd be sick because I
[01:30:12] because I would cuss because I would I
[01:30:14] would definitely cuss praise the Lord
[01:30:16] [ __ ] that's it I would
[01:30:18] definitely cuss I would definitely cuss
[01:30:20] man because that's that's the world and
[01:30:23] there's a lot of people hear this like
[01:30:24] oh my God that's this is oh my God let
[01:30:26] me close my ear you know this the
[01:30:30] world's
[01:30:31] tough the world's tough and when you
[01:30:35] come up the way I came up the only way I
[01:30:38] can [ __ ] describe something sometimes
[01:30:40] to say [ __ ] a [ __ ] because
[01:30:43] that's how dark this [ __ ]
[01:30:45] was and I can't make it flowery I can't
[01:30:50] make it PG like oh I want my kids to
[01:30:53] like I have a clean edition of this book
[01:30:55] have oh you have a non-explicit version
[01:30:57] yes because people like I want my I want
[01:30:59] my kid to read your book but you but you
[01:31:02] cuss so much I can't I imagine it's
[01:31:04] about half the size yes it's very small
[01:31:06] yes so so the funny thing about it is
[01:31:10] like how long are you going to shelter
[01:31:14] your child from a world that's evil as
[01:31:17] [ __ ] that's going to come at you it's
[01:31:20] going to come at you whether you've been
[01:31:21] bullied or not there's going to come a
[01:31:23] time
[01:31:24] when it's going to come at you and it's
[01:31:27] G to be a lot worse than [ __ ] or
[01:31:29] [ __ ] it's G to be a lot worse and
[01:31:32] so we are training kids and people to be
[01:31:37] soft in a world that continuously gets
[01:31:41] harder and it doesn't it doesn't
[01:31:44] correlate like that guy talking about
[01:31:46] the tear gas with the seals is that
[01:31:49] necessary I don't know but what is
[01:31:52] necessary is you have to build a person
[01:31:56] that can withstand the pressures of
[01:31:58] whatever they're going to be dealing
[01:32:00] with in
[01:32:01] life and we don't do that I'm not trying
[01:32:05] to send a message of run 200 miles be
[01:32:08] the bad [ __ ] in the world but be
[01:32:11] tough you better have a part about you
[01:32:14] that's tough a part about you that can
[01:32:16] break down situations and get better and
[01:32:19] break down situations very quickly
[01:32:22] within some trauma in your life some
[01:32:25] Devastation in your life because it's
[01:32:26] going to come the devastation the trauma
[01:32:28] is going to come and you can't allow
[01:32:30] that to become a jersey barrier it can't
[01:32:33] be a jersey barrier it has to be
[01:32:34] something that you can maneuver through
[01:32:36] very quickly and move forward that takes
[01:32:38] a lot of toughness well unchosen
[01:32:41] suffering is going to happen right so
[01:32:43] the only thing that you can do is have
[01:32:45] some chosen suffering to prepare for it
[01:32:47] it's the only thing you can do that's
[01:32:48] the only thing you can practice for the
[01:32:49] unchosen suffering is have chosen
[01:32:52] suffering do something that's sucks
[01:32:54] every day I had hubman on the show a few
[01:32:58] months ago and he told me about bringing
[01:33:00] you into his lab and putting you in VR
[01:33:04] underwater with sharks right give me
[01:33:07] your experience with huberman he's great
[01:33:11] he he knows his stuff he knows his stuff
[01:33:15] um yeah he's just a he's a very
[01:33:18] knowledgeable man on what he's doing
[01:33:20] what's being in VR with sharks like it's
[01:33:22] nothing no no no because one thing about
[01:33:26] me is I deal in
[01:33:27] reality you put me in VR as VR it's a
[01:33:32] fake thing and I work in reality I only
[01:33:37] work in reality I don't work in fake
[01:33:39] situations so that's why it didn't work
[01:33:41] on me you put me in a real ocean with
[01:33:44] real sharks you'll get your real
[01:33:47] reaction you put me in a room that I
[01:33:51] when you walk in the
[01:33:52] door and you sit down in the chair and
[01:33:54] you put some [ __ ] on your [ __ ] face I
[01:33:57] know I'm in a [ __ ] chair I know I'm
[01:34:00] in a room if you get that psyched the
[01:34:02] [ __ ] out you need to study that more
[01:34:05] than that you know what I'm saying yeah
[01:34:07] why are you so sensitive why you so if
[01:34:10] you are on a high wire because you're
[01:34:12] afraid of heights but you're sitting
[01:34:15] firmly on the [ __ ] ground you need to
[01:34:17] study the fact that you're doing
[01:34:19] something wrong don't study the freight
[01:34:22] of heights study why the [ __ ] do I know
[01:34:24] I'm on the [ __ ] ground in a [ __ ]
[01:34:26] chair but I'm afraid of what's on this
[01:34:29] screen so I don't allow anything to go
[01:34:32] beyond the truth he said that um
[01:34:36] obviously you didn't know this in
[01:34:37] advance it could have been the most
[01:34:39] lifelike VR in the history of the world
[01:34:41] and apparently it was a group of you
[01:34:43] guys and someone had to go first someone
[01:34:46] had to go first you're not that good
[01:34:47] with water not sure how you feel about
[01:34:49] sharks but can't imagine you're a fan
[01:34:51] um and you would just like
[01:34:54] me me please I'm first yeah I'm like
[01:34:57] that with
[01:34:58] everything because why I sit back in the
[01:35:01] back and think about let me watch you go
[01:35:04] first you can watch me go first is there
[01:35:07] anything that you'd like to study with
[01:35:10] huberman would there be any like cool
[01:35:12] tests is there anything that you've been
[01:35:13] thinking about to do with performance or
[01:35:15] anything like that at the moment no
[01:35:18] you've just got your own mental lab
[01:35:19] you're doing everything lab every
[01:35:21] everything I need is in my mental lab
[01:35:24] everything because I'm in constant study
[01:35:26] of
[01:35:27] myself that's and I know what needs to
[01:35:30] be conquered because I'm constantly
[01:35:32] going through what I don't like what I'm
[01:35:36] not comfortable with you know like I'm I
[01:35:40] know and only I can fix these problems
[01:35:44] because I have to face these problems so
[01:35:47] I have a rolling a rolling log on what
[01:35:50] needs to happen so I'm I'm really good
[01:35:52] about being accountable about okay you
[01:35:55] need to be better here you need be
[01:35:56] better here you need to overcome this
[01:35:58] overcome that and I do a good job of
[01:36:01] doing that you talk about performance
[01:36:02] without a purpose M what's
[01:36:05] that so like for instance let's say you
[01:36:09] have no races let's say you have no
[01:36:11] classes no nothing you have there's no
[01:36:14] purpose in your life you know people
[01:36:16] need to have purpose to get up they need
[01:36:18] purpose to
[01:36:19] perform you need to get to a point in
[01:36:21] your life where there's nothing on the
[01:36:24] docket there's no 5K there's no there's
[01:36:28] no um I'm going to get into school to be
[01:36:30] this or that and still perform to the
[01:36:33] highest level because what people don't
[01:36:35] get is one day that thing's going to
[01:36:37] come up and if you're not constantly
[01:36:40] performing without purpose you're not
[01:36:43] going to be ready when the time
[01:36:45] comes it's this magical thing purpose
[01:36:47] that we're all looking for but what's
[01:36:49] funny about it all is that we need these
[01:36:52] things to perform
[01:36:54] but we don't take a second to realize
[01:36:56] the purpose is always there the purpose
[01:36:59] never leaves us because the very purpose
[01:37:02] is you you are always the purpose there
[01:37:06] may be another purpose like being a seal
[01:37:09] or going to college or whatever but the
[01:37:11] main purpose in life is you so if you
[01:37:14] wake up in the morning and you don't
[01:37:15] want to do
[01:37:17] something you don't care enough about
[01:37:19] yourself and that's what you need to
[01:37:22] really research is man why am I not
[01:37:25] doing this for myself because that is
[01:37:27] that is the number one purpose in life
[01:37:30] is to better
[01:37:32] oneself so that's the only purpose I
[01:37:34] [ __ ] need so the reason I get up
[01:37:37] every day even though there's no race or
[01:37:38] there's no school there's nothing in
[01:37:40] front of me is because I have pride in
[01:37:43] myself but where do you go to you wake
[01:37:45] up on the morning it's cold it's wet
[01:37:47] it's dark you've got no cartilage in
[01:37:50] your knee you've got shitty shorts
[01:37:52] whatever it is that's the issue today
[01:37:54] keep
[01:37:56] talking you've got these problems right
[01:37:59] I need you to keep talking about what
[01:38:00] you were just saying it's warm on the
[01:38:02] couch your M say stay in bed it's comfy
[01:38:05] it's cozy you've got work later on you
[01:38:07] had an argument last night you're
[01:38:08] slightly hung over because I know every
[01:38:11] [ __ ] ain't gonna do what I'm
[01:38:12] gonna do so this is how you level up
[01:38:16] that's how you level up I know there's a
[01:38:18] whole bunch of people with that right
[01:38:21] there that fires me up that makes me
[01:38:24] [ __ ] happy what you just said that
[01:38:26] brings joy to my life right there why
[01:38:28] because I know there's so many people
[01:38:30] that have the ability and just refuse to
[01:38:35] get off that couch refuse to study a few
[01:38:38] more hours refuse to go deeper to go
[01:38:40] further and that's where I gained the
[01:38:44] advantage it's so easy to be great
[01:38:46] nowadays my friend because most people
[01:38:48] are weak most people don't want to go to
[01:38:50] that extra mile most people don't want
[01:38:52] to find that extra cuz it sucks it's
[01:38:54] miserable it's lonely you talk about
[01:38:57] that you were kind of you know Lonely by
[01:39:00] yourself I was the same way and that
[01:39:04] used to hurt me growing up now I [ __ ]
[01:39:07] thrive in that [ __ ] that's the only
[01:39:09] place to be well that was one of the
[01:39:12] things that is so surprising about
[01:39:16] growing up through difficulty you know
[01:39:18] so loneliness is one example right
[01:39:20] growing up as a lonely kid what you
[01:39:22] realize is lot of the things that you
[01:39:25] feared or hated or embarrassed about as
[01:39:28] a child end up being the Genesis of the
[01:39:31] things that you're most proud about as
[01:39:32] an adult so the fact that you can work
[01:39:36] and thrive in solitude gives you the
[01:39:38] opportunity to be able to move to
[01:39:40] America and start a podcast or decide to
[01:39:42] do hell week three times in a row or it
[01:39:45] doesn't matter how long or dark the
[01:39:47] course is you're just going to stay MH
[01:39:50] the fact that you were uh forced to be
[01:39:53] VI
[01:39:53] and to assess people to work out what's
[01:39:56] going on when you became an adult allows
[01:39:59] you to detect the vibe and the energy of
[01:40:02] whoever it is that you're speaking with
[01:40:03] and know that this person is someone
[01:40:04] that I want to hang with and this
[01:40:05] person's somebody that I don't right all
[01:40:08] of the things in fact I would go as far
[01:40:10] as to say there's not one thing in my
[01:40:12] life that I see as a pure advantage that
[01:40:16] doesn't have a dark side to it that came
[01:40:18] about at some other point as well right
[01:40:20] so one of the reasons that I spent so
[01:40:23] much time as a kid in my bedroom
[01:40:25] listening to audio tapes because I
[01:40:27] didn't have anyone to play with right
[01:40:28] only child little bit sort of unpopular
[01:40:31] right so I'd be in my bedroom listening
[01:40:33] to audio tapes and we go to the library
[01:40:35] every two weeks and we'd take the tapes
[01:40:37] back and we get new tapes and i' bring
[01:40:39] them and listen to them again right but
[01:40:41] you roll the clock forward 20 years and
[01:40:43] what's the 2023 version of an audio tape
[01:40:47] it's a podcast it's a podcast that's
[01:40:50] right A lot of the things that you love
[01:40:52] and value in yourself in adulthood are
[01:40:56] the light side of something that you
[01:40:57] were ashamed fearful disgusted by when
[01:41:00] you were younger yeah I mean I think
[01:41:02] that comes from
[01:41:04] overcoming a lot of people you know
[01:41:07] wonder how did you become this how you
[01:41:09] become so vulnerable how you how are you
[01:41:11] doing a podcast now when you were this
[01:41:13] kid you overcame things you fought them
[01:41:18] and now this is what happens this is on
[01:41:20] the other side of
[01:41:21] overcoming it Bec you become very very
[01:41:25] powerful when you overcome yourself all
[01:41:28] those things you once cowed from you
[01:41:30] were afraid of when you face him eye to
[01:41:32] eye every day you now become a person
[01:41:35] who has a great
[01:41:38] podcast let's say that there's someone
[01:41:39] listening who resonates with what you're
[01:41:42] talking about you know they've been
[01:41:43] through trauma they've been through hard
[01:41:44] times but they keep breaking promises to
[01:41:46] themselves and they're struggling to get
[01:41:48] off the couch and they're having a pity
[01:41:50] party MH how can they stop feeling sorry
[01:41:52] for themselves
[01:41:54] that's a difficult
[01:41:55] one because you have to want it you have
[01:42:00] to want to be better and it starts off
[01:42:03] with you have to have pride in
[01:42:05] yourself you you have to have pride in
[01:42:08] yourself you have to have there's
[01:42:10] something about you whether it's your
[01:42:11] last name whether it's just the smallest
[01:42:15] thing you have to be proud of yourself
[01:42:18] and if you have no pride in yourself I
[01:42:20] can't give it to you because you're
[01:42:22] always going to compromise you're fold
[01:42:24] always I'm very proud of myself that's
[01:42:25] why when people said you no way you can
[01:42:29] do better than can't hurt
[01:42:31] me Roger that we'll [ __ ] see it's
[01:42:35] that Pride that wakes you up now I'm not
[01:42:37] talking about bad
[01:42:39] Pride I I'm the attention to detail for
[01:42:42] the human being I want to do I call this
[01:42:44] thing like I want to be the standard I
[01:42:47] want to be that guy like every place I
[01:42:50] went in the military there was this
[01:42:52] ethos
[01:42:53] about how this place is how we're going
[01:42:56] to live how we're going to represent
[01:42:59] ourselves and I walked around and I saw
[01:43:03] that most people didn't live up to that
[01:43:05] ethos like if you go to whatever
[01:43:08] whatever company they they had this
[01:43:10] mission statement on how we want to run
[01:43:13] our
[01:43:14] company I made one for
[01:43:17] myself on how I want to be and that is
[01:43:21] why if people can make up a mission
[01:43:23] statement an ethos and which they want
[01:43:25] to live by and every morning you wake up
[01:43:29] you hold yourself accountable to that
[01:43:31] mission not a company is your own make
[01:43:34] up your own mission statement what do
[01:43:36] you want to be in life and once you do
[01:43:39] that now you can work with somebody to
[01:43:41] get better you can work with yourself to
[01:43:43] get better but until you know what you
[01:43:45] want to stand for you will always just
[01:43:48] be sitting down you'll never stand for
[01:43:50] anything what's that quote if you don't
[01:43:53] stand for uh something you'll fall for
[01:43:55] everything that's it it's a true
[01:43:57] statement in the book you talk about uh
[01:44:01] Roger that there being two types of
[01:44:03] Roger that I absolutely adore the second
[01:44:07] type uh received orders given expect
[01:44:11] results that's it that's it so cool
[01:44:15] above and beyond more than was expected
[01:44:17] to the letter that's Roger that that is
[01:44:21] for me what Roger that means received
[01:44:23] orders given yep expect results expect
[01:44:26] results that's right so [ __ ] dope
[01:44:29] that is it that is it and when you hear
[01:44:32] that from somebody who gets it you know
[01:44:34] it because you can look in their eyes
[01:44:36] you feel that energy man it connects
[01:44:38] immediately they're out here to get a
[01:44:40] job done Roger
[01:44:42] that
[01:44:44] so the start of the book or at least the
[01:44:47] start of the audio book you've got a few
[01:44:48] different intros right uh Rogan yep your
[01:44:52] mom mhm M and The Rock right uh slightly
[01:44:56] odd trifactor
[01:44:58] but I do think it works so obviously
[01:45:00] your time Rogan's had you on now the
[01:45:02] third time that you've been on what have
[01:45:04] you learned since being friends with him
[01:45:06] he's a very singular individual you know
[01:45:08] what one thing about him is that he's
[01:45:11] made it and he's all about everybody
[01:45:13] else making
[01:45:14] it there's one thing that he believes in
[01:45:17] is that there's enough food enough cake
[01:45:19] for everybody out here to eat so there's
[01:45:22] a lot of people in this world who don't
[01:45:23] want to see you make it because they
[01:45:25] think you could take a piece of their
[01:45:26] pie that motherfucker's like look dude
[01:45:29] pie for everybody I got 14 pies bro one
[01:45:33] for every [ __ ] here and so he's
[01:45:35] all about people making it and that's
[01:45:37] something that a lot of us can you know
[01:45:40] learn from that people think oh I made
[01:45:43] it I'm gonna hold on to it I'm not g to
[01:45:46] help anybody else out the thing is I
[01:45:48] don't even know if he was uh something
[01:45:51] tells me he had that philosophy before
[01:45:52] he'd even made it yeah as he was on the
[01:45:54] come up yeah I mean I really didn't know
[01:45:55] him that much back then but um the he
[01:46:00] really is to
[01:46:02] me the Oprah of the modern day he's the
[01:46:07] Oprah of the modern day you know that
[01:46:09] that guy just has made so many people
[01:46:12] known to the world gotten so many
[01:46:16] messages out so yeah I said uh I was
[01:46:19] talking to Andrew Schultz about the same
[01:46:20] thing and he said very similar sentiment
[01:46:23] especially he's coming from a comedy uh
[01:46:25] angle right and if you're going to be
[01:46:27] championed in comedy it's super super
[01:46:29] difficult right and what he what he said
[01:46:32] was that uh the comedy world is so zeros
[01:46:36] some like your gig is not my gig and the
[01:46:38] fact that you can have someone that just
[01:46:40] gives that gift out is very rare another
[01:46:42] friend his wife does iic medicine so
[01:46:46] it's I'm not really too sure what it is
[01:46:49] but she did something to do with like
[01:46:50] tarot card reading okay and he asked her
[01:46:54] he was about to go on Rogan's podcast so
[01:46:56] he asked her to do the tarot card
[01:46:58] readings about Joel because it might
[01:46:59] give him a little bit more insight or it
[01:47:01] would just be interesting in general and
[01:47:03] the tarot card that she pulls out might
[01:47:05] not be tarot it be something similar the
[01:47:07] card that she pulled out was um a older
[01:47:11] Warrior cross-legged sat under a tree
[01:47:14] with his hands like that this guy did
[01:47:17] he's got a weapon down next to him
[01:47:18] weapons laid down transcended the battle
[01:47:21] and I was like holy [ __ ] I'm I'm not too
[01:47:24] sure I'm not too sure about what's going
[01:47:25] on with this tarot card reading thing
[01:47:26] but that one seems pretty accurate it's
[01:47:27] probably perfect for him yeah yeah yeah
[01:47:30] there's something about
[01:47:32] um raising other people up as you go
[01:47:34] along oh yeah that you know as you get a
[01:47:37] platform as you have the opportunity to
[01:47:39] expose other people that are almost all
[01:47:42] of your time as a podcaster is slip
[01:47:44] streaming other people who have bigger
[01:47:45] platforms and then after a while you get
[01:47:47] to the stage where you can be that
[01:47:48] springboard for others right some
[01:47:50] unbelievably talented person that nobody
[01:47:52] knows about true statement there you go
[01:47:54] now the world can know about you he's
[01:47:56] done the best at that he's the best at
[01:47:58] that what about the rock if you Haven
[01:48:00] met him you ever trained with him never
[01:48:03] never we just
[01:48:04] dm'd and I was like I'm GNA give you a
[01:48:08] shot in the dark you know the guy
[01:48:10] follows me he knows about me whatever I
[01:48:13] was like this guy's so big man he ain't
[01:48:14] G [ __ ] it so I D in man within like 20
[01:48:18] minutes hey man what's up brother sends
[01:48:21] me a voice message in DM been following
[01:48:24] your work man love what you [ __ ] do
[01:48:27] blah blah blah blah blah oh yeah no
[01:48:29] problem man I'll I'll hook you up I'll
[01:48:32] be more than honor to hook you up and in
[01:48:34] the audio book what people don't know is
[01:48:36] I left him alone I was like hey man
[01:48:38] thank you I appreciate it I want to
[01:48:40] bother you go back to doing the great
[01:48:42] work that you do you're so busy so I was
[01:48:45] doing the audio book he was like Hey
[01:48:47] brother you want me to um you know read
[01:48:49] what I wrote for you for the Audi book
[01:48:51] and I was like
[01:48:53] yeah that's great that's how the idea
[01:48:56] came about it was actually The Rock's
[01:48:58] idea for him to do the blurb so then I
[01:49:01] got Joe Rogan and I got my mom to read
[01:49:03] the blurs so that came from him I wasn't
[01:49:06] G to put the blurbs in the audio book
[01:49:08] but he was like hey man I got a studio
[01:49:11] right here I'll blast it out send it
[01:49:14] over to you and we'll get it done that's
[01:49:16] a training session that the world wants
[01:49:18] to
[01:49:19] see I believe so I believe so
[01:49:23] that should be part of the book tour
[01:49:25] should be a training a training session
[01:49:27] between you guys talk me through what
[01:49:29] the next phase of your life has in store
[01:49:32] um so after this podcast I probably
[01:49:34] won't do another one for a very long
[01:49:36] time and I did my book came out on the
[01:49:40] 6th it's now the 16th I did my 10 days
[01:49:42] of the book and now it's done and now
[01:49:46] it's going back to the lab so now I go
[01:49:48] back go back to firefighting go back to
[01:49:52] finding another level of David gogins
[01:49:54] and that's
[01:49:55] done in quiet areas and finding more of
[01:50:00] myself finding these these spaces I
[01:50:02] haven't you know discovered yet in my
[01:50:05] mind and I really love that about life I
[01:50:09] love mastering
[01:50:11] self I love it I love it there there
[01:50:15] there's nothing more because I know
[01:50:16] where I came from and it's amazing that
[01:50:20] where I came from that person could have
[01:50:22] died that
[01:50:26] very fat lazy unfulfilled person and
[01:50:31] with inside that person was this person
[01:50:33] talking to you is very freaky to me and
[01:50:37] a lot of us have these two people that
[01:50:39] you have greatness way over here but you
[01:50:44] decide to live in this space over here
[01:50:49] because between greatness or between
[01:50:51] this space here and greatness there's a
[01:50:54] lot of [ __ ] work there's so much
[01:50:57] space to fill in with work and we just
[01:50:59] say [ __ ] it I just stay over here in
[01:51:02] this space so I like to [ __ ] examine
[01:51:06] all these spaces and there's there's
[01:51:09] still more there's still more still a
[01:51:11] lot more are you aiming to find peace at
[01:51:14] any point think about this I love that
[01:51:17] question I'm glad you I'm so glad you
[01:51:19] asked
[01:51:21] it you you know a little bit about
[01:51:24] me when you've come from that place I
[01:51:26] talk about to the place of him now it's
[01:51:29] not the peace you find it's the peace I
[01:51:32] find and I find so much peace in looking
[01:51:36] back at that young David 8 years old
[01:51:39] with white splashes on his face and
[01:51:41] stuttering and hair patches falling out
[01:51:44] and I look at him I'm like man there's
[01:51:47] so much peace in knowing what I've
[01:51:49] accomplished and what I've done so my
[01:51:51] peace may be different for others that's
[01:51:54] why I never critique or never judge
[01:51:57] anyone because I don't know your story
[01:51:59] where you come from I found peace years
[01:52:02] ago years
[01:52:04] ago in the battle in the battle you find
[01:52:08] peace when you go to war with yourself
[01:52:10] you find a lot of Peace because you know
[01:52:13] exactly who you are and that is where
[01:52:16] the peace is really found for
[01:52:19] me David you're a spectacular individual
[01:52:22] I really really appreciate your time uh
[01:52:23] the book is fantastic your message is
[01:52:25] fantastic uh I can't wait to see what

## Plain Text (for processing)

I'm trying to build people up I'm trying to armor their mind I'm trying to get them the belief because this world we live in is tough it will beat you down the world and the life that we live in is the ultimate competitor it will try to take you out it will find your weakness and it will just Hammer you if I can help you build belief build confidence to the point where nothing can hurt you because you know exactly who you are David Goggins welcome to the show hey man I appreciate you having me brother thank you thank you for being here where have you been for the last four years you've been jumping out of helicopters and fighting fires and what have you been doing well I did that last year right I guess this year I did that but I just I just do me you know I'm out there running working out and uh just trying to find out more of what this is all about trying to find out more of what I'm all about so that takes me getting away you know I'm not about even doing these podcasts man so not nothing against you but I'm I'm not about all this stuff I'm not one that likes to hear himself talk a lot um I'm about action and action means less talking and more doing so that's where I've been what is that smoke jumping stuff so basically it's um you know about Wildland firefighting about when the forest has fires there's a lot of times there's roads and there's access to get there so these you know whether it be a um hot shot crew or whatever these different Crews who come in by vehicle they can get into the fire that way what a smoke jumper is is you can't get a vehicle into that place it is a spot where it's tight there's no vehicles there's no access so they'll send us in there smoke jumpers jump out of airplanes and we'll land in these really tight small Drop Zones with all of our gear and we'll put the fire out how do you take Walter in we jump out so everything is hang on you're jumping out of a airplane parachute with backpacks of water like a camel pack type thing so we'll jump out we'll have this it's called a diddy pack and it and it sits in you know it sits like by your waist you know yep on your legs area when you jump out and that has a lot of your gear but what happens is once you jump out the aircraft would go lower and it will push out all the rest of your gear your water pumps oh and that'll get add with own little parachut so a lot of our main gear gets dropped into us and then we're out there for several days until the fire is put out by us and only us that's insane it's insane yeah why' you do that well when I left the military um you're I'm always looking for more I'm always looking for what's the next thing for myself how can I grow and that right there was the next thing for me you know I didn't want to sit back and you know just enjoy my retirement for the military that's there's there there's no growth in that so I decided to go out and do this so you jump out of an airplan with a team you get your kit also parachuted out of the back you're now in the middle of an area where there's no Evac there's no vehicles that can come and get you m there's a fire mhm you need to put the fire out and you don't stop until you're done that's it sometimes there is a way to get out but a lot of times it's just you know if someone gets hurt on the jump a lot of times we have to build like cut down a bunch of trees so a helicopter can come in land and get them out so we are the only access we have to save ourselves so a lot of times we are the team to get us in and to get us out what was the longest Mission exercise that you did I think the longest one I did was seven days so and what's the sort of daily routine are you sleeping do you get much sleep at all no not really so what happens is and the thing about being in Canada so I do this out of uh out of British Columbia so what happens is there's a lot of daylight when I'm so when I'm out there man there's a lot of daylight in the middle of the summer when it's Hest when you've got tons of right okay that's right so there's not much there's not much dark so you're basically working a lot of hours so and then when it gets dark you're actually working through the nighttime and then you get a little you know you get a little rest and you wake up and you're at it again and then when the fire is out you Patrol the fire fire make sure there's no more hot spots make sure everything is black and wet cuz we we literally wet the whole area down so there's no hot spots and then when that's all done we'll demob which means we'll clean up all the stuff all our hoses you know we'll we'll pack up all our stuff and then we'll we'll get out of there did you ask to be paid for this I I get about I think the the the pay is about 12 to 15 bucks an hour so it was about it man like when I first started doing this job um people didn't know that you know I'm actually successful in business and then it realized that I was like basically turned down millions of dollars to do this job and they can continue thinking it to make 15 bucks an hour to make 15 bucks an hour so yeah but you know like I said for me the the the whole money part of it it's it's it's not with about I'm all about that growth and and that growth isn't in these massive paychecks for speaking to corporations stuff like that the growth for me is in that 12 to $15 an hour when you're out there and it's like 20 you know 20 degrees and you're freezing your ass off and you're thinking you know what I don't need to be here anymore and you start questioning yourself why you're here and there's a lot of growth in that why did you decide to release another book what Was undone with the first one well the first one was basically um a bachelor's degree with the mind that's how I look at it and no one knew who I was so this is the book never finished as the book that I wanted to come out first but how am I going to get so deep into something when no one Els who the hell I am so first I have to give you some backstory on who the hell David Goggins is some credentials that's it and so I got some basic credentials out there and now I can dive in more because most people think I'm just some Grand animal who runs and yells and just says [ __ ] and mother [ __ ] all the time and that's nowhere near the truth that's maybe what they see in a one minute video and that's what people believe but there's a lot of thought behind a person being a Bor and loser becoming who I am today you don't just wake up and just Rocky the [ __ ] you gotta wake up and think about you know there's a process to getting better and that process is never finished it's an appropriate title so one of the things I've been thinking about is the danger of success making you soft and this must be something that you've battled with over the last few years right more money more attention more Fame more free things if you wanted more opportunities to go places and do stuff with people right how have you dealt with this battle of success not making you soft you have to cap it you have to learn to cap success so what I do is like right now I don't like doing podcasts there's a lot of things I don't do I have to do now to get the messes out there to help people out and what I mean by capping success I believe everybody should live their life so everything that someone says in life take it with a grain of salt take what they give and don't be like oh David Goin said this or whoever said this no do not take what I say and do exactly what I say so for me what makes me who I am because my mission is very different than yours anybody else's I have to go into a situation okay I'm a guy who wants to make people better for people to get better I have to continuously get better myself for me to do that I can't just say oh I have this resume the resume is there forever I'm good I have to cap My Success because for me to help people out I can't just say I did it once and I'm good I have to continue to reinvent the will of the mind and figure out more and more ways for you to pull because if I have a cookie cutter message it may hit five people out of 25 you just failed my message needs to be in a way where I can hit all 25 people it needs to be broad enough to where all 25 people may not like the message but they're getting something from it and that is evolution you must continue to evolve and and you don't evolve for me in my job unless I cap myself somewhere and say okay you made this much money get back to [ __ ] work it's time to get back to work stop hearing yourself talk get off the podcast don't be on social media too much cut out all the [ __ ] noise get back to the [ __ ] mental lab because that's where the knowledge came from so for me I must cap myself so I can come back with better more unique knowledge versus the C know all that cookie hutter knowledge that's out there that's why people buy the books I have because it's not cookie cutter it's real knowledge the other thing now is when you first started you were a Lone Ranger right nobody really knew who you were outside of some obscure endurance places and half-heard truths of these weird myths right but now you've got people's expectations layed on top as well so not only have you got to deal with success potentially making you soft so you've got to cap that you've got to say no to more money and opportunities and cool people right you've also got this extra layer of expect that's coming through from other people too and I think that you talk about trained humility right in the new book too I've got to presume that that fits into this equation right it fits in big time um and that's one big reason why I do fight fire because the all the knowledge for myself comes from that place it doesn't come from the place of success my knowledge does not come from the place like because for me like I built Goggins from the ground up I was born David goggin David gogins wasn't good enough enough he was a scared bullied uh abused kid um who struggled in life and that kid whenever something got tough no matter how hard I trained no matter how ready I was whenever something got tough for me David goggin the real David Goggins would come out and he would quit so I realized this over a period of time so I had to build goggin and in that process I have to go back to that mental lab and that mental lab is at scratch that mental lab isn't that trained humility and so that's where I get better I get better when I'm digging holes in the ground when I'm waking up early knowing I don't have to do these things that's where I get better so it's important to stay hungry it's important to stay hungry but it's important more to stay humble within that hunger so why you're hungry a lot of people are hungry but humility is everything what was that story about William Crawford the janitor yeah so this guy won the Medal of Honor so he won the Medal of Honor and which is the highest award in the military and this guy went to the Air Force Academy and he was a janitor and no one knew who the [ __ ] this man was he had the highest award in all the milit military for heroics for heroics saving lives putting his life on the line could have you know could have been killed and he is now basically you know cleaning [ __ ] for young kids and we can all imagine how that probably went you know there's probably some you know little bit of taunting here and there and he just sat there and cleaned the [ __ ] so that's why he's in my trained humility part because for this man to be at the level he was and had that kind of humility to go I'm a MD of Honor winner but I'm gonna put that in my closet and I'm gonna pick up my broom and dust pan and I'm gonna pick up you know this Rag and clean this [ __ ] for these young men that right there is amazing for me man that's that's where you grow that's that's growth huge growth and also it shows that he was doing his job he was a servant he didn't look at himself any better than anybody else the second you do that you're totally lost you cannot look at yourself like people with me even I always look at people I I know where you are I know where because I've been there that's why I helped so many people out I've I've never been above you I've always pretty much been beneath you and that's where my knowledge came from so I know how to reach those people who are in the dungeon because I've been there so many times speaking of getting too soft did you see that there was a news story that came out recently about the treatment of seals during the selection process do you see this yeah yeah I saw it yeah they were getting uh sprayed with tear gas whilst they were on the ground and they were made to sing Happy Birthday so that they couldn't hold their breath while it was happening and there was a a quote from uh this guy I think this type of training is really senseless said Sven yort a Juke University associate professor who studies tear gas and its effects it looks more like a form of hazing right I see all that trust me like I said you know I'm not g to sugarcoat anything I understand that guy I understand exactly where you're coming from that is your personal opinion and I totally get that but there's very few people in this world who want to do a job like that and it takes a different kind of mindset is it tear grass appropriate I don't know how hard that training is I don't expect anybody to understand it but one% but the loud voices of this world are the 99% who don't understand exactly what you have to do that's why when I speak and you don't understand me it's probably a good thing because that probably means I'm in an area of life that you're not in which is fine that's why I don't judge people and this guy right here judging that unless you've been there and done that and you really can't speak about it unless you're in those situations that are so hard that takes a special human being to get through them I think it's the same kind of feeling that I get when I heard about Elon Musk telling the employees at Twitter M we're going to ask you to work harder than you've ever worked in your life this is a place Twitter is now a company where people can go if they want to be in the top not. one% of hardworking programmers and software developers on the planet that's right and there was everybody was up in arms this is unbelievable we're going back to this old version of capitalism where the the worker is being abused and used and thrown away what they didn't account for is that there is a non insignificant cohort of people for whom that's their dream that's right people who want to be able to get up on a morning having gone to bed 4 hours before and can contribute to some sort of progress that they think this this is what I'm here for yep and it's the same with the seals if you're not the sort of person that is built to go through selection it's like speaking a different language and that's why I don't try to convince people otherwise I understand that why you're confused I understand why you say things like that I'm not saying anything bad about that I understand it but also what you don't understand what you fail to understand is the other side that you need people like that you need the Elon musks you need the David Goggins you need some of these Navy some of these other people you need those people and they don't they forget that and it takes a very very unique person and unique mind to do some of these jobs that are necessary in this world well especially when we're thinking about someone going to war right do you want your Armed Forces to be underprepared for the battlefield because you didn't want to be too mean to them in advance that's that's the problem that's the problem and that's a problem that I've always had I've always had is that right there is that with even even some of the most trained people in the world fall back on that it's easy to talk about like I said when you go through it once when it's a perishable skill hardness mental hardening mental toughness it's a perishable skill just because you went through some training once and you got through it doesn't mean it lasts [ __ ] forever and that's where most people hated me in my life because I realized that you don't to say oh I got it I'm checked off I'm good for the rest of my life that's why you have recall you recall on [ __ ] everything and you definitely must recall when it comes to the mind that is one of the biggest requalification you must have and when you're at that level you gotta recall every [ __ ] day not once a year one of the other things that you did to stop yourself from getting soft was running the Moab 240 yep talk me through that experience so um I hadn't Run 100 mile race in I think it was about 6 years you know I had you know some heart surgeries I had some maybe some questioning in my mind about I call it part-time Savage I started kind of going through this I started getting you know a little bit injuries a little bit this a little that things that back in the day never slowed me down so when I got my head out of my ass and realized that hey we have more left we can still push harder we're not there yet I realized talking to a guy named Cameron Haynes who this race 240 mile race and um I say I go is this the is this the new level is this the new is this the new push so when I decided to do that race it was in the back of my mind like man I've really become an expert at running 100 mile races so for me this was the new level the 200 plus mile race and what was so amazing about that as you probably read in the book I had a hard time the first time doing it I came back and did better but what's amazing about the human mind is that it becomes your new Norm like to to to think that I can run 200 miles 240 miles and that becomes like running 50 I never thought that was possible this is why I'm I'm always pushing that limit because I know that within pushing these limits there's always more so I end up doing like almost like backtack 200 mile runs when the 200 mile race 240 mile race was hard at once it became something that was very easy after I figured it out so that's why that happened well you got lost on the first one oh yeah and then you went to bed and woke up halfway through the night and nudged Kish and said how long have we got left until the end of the race but because you hadn't completed the official route you couldn't go across the official Finish Line yeah so you ring your race um like Pacers some of whom had gone home yep what like what what do you think it's 3 in the morning and you're ringing people saying you know that race that we just finished because of health problems can we go back and finish it so the crazy thing about that and that and that's but so I got lost the first time I got seriously sick was off Court so basically I bed down about 12 hours then I got back in the race so I was still a part of the official race now okay so the first time I got lost I I got sick got back got lost got back in the race after 12 hours of being out of the race so now I get to about 200 and some miles and I'm sick as hell can't breathe H out to pulmonary edema totally jacked up and now the doctor tells me if if you get off course now and you go to the doctor you won't be able to come back and finish the race so I had to make a call like you know what I'm pretty messed up got off so this is where you're talking about I'm literally laying in bed and I'm feeling better and I thought honestly I swear to God I thought that someone was speaking to me I thought it was Jennifer it was like you're not done yet [ __ ] and I'm like what the [ __ ] is this it was actually probably my subconscious saying get your ass back out there so I wake Jennifer up I'm like hey how much time do we have until the cut off I know that I'm already you know dnfed so matter what happens here I'm not going to be an official finisher of this race this isn't for Glory no this is now for the fact that you can so either you can sit here and not and think about that for a whole year until you come back here and do this or you can go out there for yourself and take some some kind of pride in knowing that you could and you did so basically I wake her up how much time left she goes something like I don't know what it was how would you say what time was like you know whatever and half my crew had left and there was two people there I woke them up they were getting ready to get on a plane I said look can you guys help me out I have 40 miles to go I'm GNA have Jennifer drop me back off at the spot where I left I'm GNA finish this [ __ ] race and I couldn't cross the finish line because I wasn't an official finisher so I end up finishing on a road on you know by a by a telephone pole and that was my official finish end up being like 250 M 255 miles but it's one of the best races of all time because we're going through it fast but all the [ __ ] times that I was like this is I I'm not going back and I went back I'm not going back and I went back I'm not going back and I went back it showed me even more of what we have as as as humans if we're willing to go there and we're willing to push that extra step and like I said you know I always tell people a lot of people man how do you do what you do at the end of the day I ask myself one question can I take one more step and usually the answer is yes so if you can answer that question and not take another step that is real failure that is real quitting so a lot of people can take one more step but they choose not to I don't know if you can take two steps you got to answer that question after you take the first step but I can always take one more step so if I choose not to that's on me and I gota live with that does that link in with the one second decision yes yes so the one second decision is I had to live through that one second decision several times during this race so this race took me a hundred and some hours okay and this is what people don't get for you to finish that race even though I dnfed I still finished in the time so there's a lot of pride in that if you're 10 and some OD hours let me use hell week this is a perfect example hell week is 130 hours and 130 hours is a lot of seconds a lot of [ __ ] seconds and if you lose let's say you win every second but one you lost it only takes one second for you to lose the whole thing so the one second decision is just that you're in a situation where life is sucking let's say you're in extreme cold water and your life is flashing before your eyes every time that wave goes over your head your thought process is I got to get the [ __ ] out of this water and you're in hell week and you're hour one of 130 [ __ ] hours it's all fun and games okay because at the beginning of Hell Week the guns are going off it's like a pep rally so you're [ __ ] hyped up and your boys are linked arms and you're getting sprayed and it's like a [ __ ] peep rally the instructure yelling at your bombs are going off concussion grenades blanks from in60s yeah who yah [ __ ] yeah [ __ ] yeah yeah [ __ ] yeah but then what they do is they shut that [ __ ] off they shut it off all that huah all that hype gets real quiet and they March you out to that surf zone for something called surf torture and it's that water that Pacific Ocean is cold as [ __ ] so no more prep rally you're now in your head you're linked arms with you know your brothers beside you you don't know if they could be there long or not you don't care you think about yourself you lay back in that first wave hit you your mind goes straight from hour two all the way to hour 130 you can't process five days of this [ __ ] you're now in you're you're now in a [ __ ] you like I gotta get out of here you're in fight or flight it's cold I can't be cold this long and then this is where that one second decision comes in you forgot every reason why you wanted to be there you don't care about seals you don't care about any of this you don't care about fighting for your country you don't care about that Gody gold Trident that they put on your chest you don't care about any of that [ __ ] no more all you want to do is go back home you want the warmth you may want something to eat you want your girl to hold you all those things of comfort are there in that one second and this is where people lose so what I do in that one second because we all think about quitting when shit's hard but what you have to do in that one second is hard to process information during pain because that pain takes over and you can't think rationally you're thinking about fight or flight save yourself that's not a rational thought it's not a thought that's going to get you through hard times most people fail that one second so what happens what I do in that one second it's and there's a bigger process to all this but in that one second I physically stayed in in that water because if I get out of the water I quit so I physically stay in the water but mentally I'm on the [ __ ] beach with the [ __ ] instructors and the instructors is cold outside so they got these Parkers on they got their cup of [ __ ] Joe and they're warm because they've already been through it so now it's your turn to go through it so mainly I get back with them I'm still in the water physically but mainly I'm back I'm chilling I got my Parker on and now I'm thinking logically cuz I'm warm now mentally warm I've taken that one second let's not quit yet Goggins let's [ __ ] think about your options where are you going to end up if you quit this [ __ ] where you gon to go what are you g to say to yourself because you know you're going to get warm the second you get out this water you GNA take a shower and you could be warm and you could be and in five days you could be out so I start thinking logically I calm my brain down because your brain just wants to get the [ __ ] out ring the bell push your hmet down get warm and then you're really [ __ ] and these are the things you have to think about the one second decision so that's what that's all about it's about gaining control of your mind putting things back in the proper perspective and then saying I really do want to be here and I'm G to have a bunch of these 1 seconds through this 130 hour journey and I have to learn to control these because if I fail one of these one seconds I will not be a seal I will not be a doctor I will not be a lawyer I will not be whatever the [ __ ] is so that's how important that one second decision is it's all about your mind takes control of you you have to say [ __ ] you I run this [ __ ] and that's what that's all about we'll get back to Goggins in one minute but first I need to tell you about element element is a tasty electrolyte drink mix with everything that you need and nothing that you don't I've replaced my morning coffee with element every day for over 3 years now and I've never looked back it means I've optimized my hydration my brain feels better I'm not getting mental f and it's helping me to curb Cravings if I'm fasting throughout the day even video guine uses it my favorite flavor is the orange that in a cold glass of water upon waking feels really really good it's a science backed electrolyte ratio of sodium potassium and magnesium which helps me to feel my absolute best all day also they

the box that's how confident they are that you love it head to drink LM nt.com slod wisdom to get a free sample pack of all eight flavors with your first box that's drink lm.com modern wisdom projecting yourself forward to see what are the consequences of failing what are the consequences of stopping yep is about as powerful of a motivation strategies as I can think of you know because what you're doing is you're trying to optimize right now to stop the discomfort that's right but what you're going to pay for that in is shame and guilt and regret long term that's right so what you need to be able to do is bundle all of that up that is as yet unfelt but will last for way way way longer you know the future is much longer than now that's right the future is going to extend out up until the day that you die and the now is just for now and even 130 hours is just 130 hours that's right and you get to look back and do you look back with Pride and Glory or do you look back with shame and guilt that's it that's that's the one second you just summarized it right there and most people fail those one seconds and then that one second leads to 20 years 30 years 40 Years of [ __ ] I have people who have been through training with me Ranger school SEAL training Air Force training and I get calls from them today and they have great lives and all they talk about is how they failed in that one moment and they can't even great they can't even enjoy eny their life now because they're now warm they're now warm there's no more suffering there's no more suffering for me either and we're in the same boat now but you're suffering and so we're not suffering but you're thinking about what you could have been I am exactly what I should have been and that's where people start to lose it because now I realize that in that one second I go through all that I know how it's going to feel CU I failed so many times before failure is the ultimate thing man I failed so many times before that's why I don't look at failure anymore as failure I look as my first second and third attempt so that's what that's all about man well I mean you went back to go and do Moab again the second time right which is your second attempt that's right had you banged your knee up it was pretty bad in between the first and the second one it was pretty bad way before either one of them uhhuh yeah yeah it was it's been jacked up now for about 20 years I've seen some nly photos of it recently it looks yeah yeah interesting yeah so all those miles I've run on this thing it's it's uh it's been a lot of uh it's been a lot of gut checks so you go back you do Moab a second time yep and then you turn your ass into like a hamburger or something as well so it's not just the knee it's the ass as well now yeah so at Mile 2011 we have a good video of it matter of fact Jennifer is like there's some people up so at at so 201 is a spot where I was really finished in the first Moab so that was a um way Mark a checkpoint for you the second time so Jennifer is extremely happy right now because I'm there yes and she knows I'm doing well now I'm doing good we're gonna get through this and so she's videoing me as I'm coming up this climb on this road and she goes there's some people up here who want to meet you you're doing so amazing I said my ass is [ __ ] up you need to get the [ __ ] desant cream and it's literally for like 20 [ __ ] miles that like people don't get it man when you get raw like that bro and you're walking cuz you the the chaing of my ass it was hamburger meat and I'm like so she's all [ __ ] happy and [ __ ] she's and I just look at her and I'm gonna put the video up on social media cuz it's it's but she's a [ __ ] Trooper bro hang on so could she was the leakage oh yeah that was on the video from behind so my shorts were absolutely raw dogged yeah so when you pull them down it's just blood and so she goes in the bathroom because she didn't know what she was going to see she has a Destin cream she walks in there and I pull them down and spread them open and I go put that [ __ ] all up in there so she goes in for the kid and she's putting this Destin cream all over the [ __ ] place man and you know what this the funny thing about it Dash when you know you got a good [ __ ] with you man when you're that raw and you're that [ __ ] up and she's just like nothing it was like saying hey can you like put some lotion on my back before I go lay out that's how she was in there man getting in it that's it man have you considered that that might be the most traumatic event of all of the things that you've done in your life what you asked Jennifer to do that day no not at all she did worse so that Leadville chapter when I talk about after I finished and then the ultra raveling or unraveling had had begun when I lay down so oh that was on the duvet and you didn't know the word duv yeah I know what the [ __ ] duve was [ __ ] you don't know the word duv blanket man okay fair enough fair enough fair enough out from the streets we call them blankets anything that you wrap up in as a [ __ ] blanket cool so I'm laying on the duvet and she's all [ __ ] like about her damn ratings that [ __ ] the Airbnb [ __ ] and I'm L like hey I'm about to [ __ ] right here because it's not your place no okay no right yes I can see why she be consern so that scene is uh is is was was bad but once again like a crime scene it's yes it was a crime scene so you've done all of this stuff right you've done the seal selection week three times strapping the legs up so that you can Runner badwater Ultra race the Asbergers everything yes of all of the physical Pursuits that you've endured which has been the most painful by far by far my first 100 mile race by far this 2019 Moab the one that I D enough but still finished that's up there but when you are um so I guess you're you're you're not prepared to run 100 miles and you take it for granted and you didn't do any training at all and you didn't have the right nutrition and off of whim like literally like you know what I want to raise money for a foundation that's how that happened so I don't know if you know the story or not but basically I'm sitting there and the Lan Survivor incident happened where a bunch of you know some seals died I want to raise money for them I went through training with most of these guys so I had the bright idea to uh raise money you know I wasn't going to do a hot dog or hamburger sale I was going to do something that people would be attracted to so I Googled the world's toughest events and what comes up is this race called the badwater 135 and it's 135 mile race through Death Valley in the summertime now I had no idea about ultr running I didn't know what the [ __ ] ultr running was but when I heard so when I saw 135 miles I automatically assumed it was a stage race where you ran like maybe 10 15 miles bed down and you got up next morning did it so when I called the race director up Chris Cosman I'm like hey I would like to do this race to raise money for a foundation he goes have you ever run a 100 miles and I was like like in in a week or like like what are you talking about he goes no like in 24 hours because that's what you got to do to qualify and I was like is that even is that even possible like I I didn't know so anyway he goes no you can't get in my race unless you qualify and I call him up on a Wednesday and that Saturday and I was a bodybuilder at the time I did cardio 20 minutes a week on the elliptical trainer every Sunday he goes yeah Saturday you're in San Diego Saturday is uh 24hour race where you run around a one mile track for 24 hours and if you can get 100 miles I'll consider you my race so I'll go sign up for this race and the first 70 miles I'm doing pretty good and then I hadn't sat down I was uh hadn't gone to the bathroom I was eating I was drinking myoplex and Rich crackers I was you know eating Rich crackers so Elite nutrition yeah elite elite high quality nutrition so what happens when you're that ignorant and you go out to do this race and you sit down in a chair your body's done so I'm sitting there and when you sit down for the first time in over 12 hours your body's now going through some metamorphosis like go [ __ ] home go go to a doctor get some help but I'm sitting there and I have this urge to go to the bathroom and there's a porter potty for me that [ __ ] wall but I can't get up because my blood pressure is all messed up from my great nutrition that I was on and so I can't stand up so I look at my ex-wife and I literally say I'm want to [ __ ] on myself right now so I sit there and I'm I'm [ __ ] up my back and I'm peeing blood down my leg and I have 30 miles to go and I end up finding away to get through that 30 miles and when I got done with that race it's the worst pain I can ever even I can't even describe the pain of that last 30 miles to anybody no one it's very hard whole body whole body I'm so when it ended I I I'm literally dizzy going up my stairs to to get to my house I'm literally I have my arms wrapped around her going up the stairs and every flight of stairs I got have to lay down because I can't stay upright for too long or I'm G pass out so I finally get in the house and when I get in the house I'm once again on the floor I'm in the kitchen on the floor just laying there I finally make it to the bathroom into the tub I get rolled in the tub and she puts the water on me I'm just laying there with the water coming on me and what I pee out looks like cocacola and I'm laying there in the worst pain of my entire life I'm shaken I'm jacked up and all I could think about was I can't believe what I just done because when you get to 70 miles of a race and you felt the way I did it's to me it was humanly impossible to even think about going 30 more miles in that shape and once you do it what what came over me when that shower hit me and the reality hit that I SP 101 miles and that last 31 miles was something that I can't even describe to people and she's like we got get you to the hospital so at the time my mom was seeing this doctor and he was like you know so so she's describing to my mom I'm going through he's like you gotta get in the hospital now and I just said just just shut up and let me enjoy this pain I don't want anything to numb it I don't want anything right now because what I had done was I just in my mind and people would take this wrong and take as wrong as you want to I don't really care I had just climbed a mental wall that was amazing and I didn't want anybody to take that pain away from me at that point because that was that was all confirmation it seems like I've heard you tell that story a number of times amazing did that set the tone or the Rhythm for what you wanted to try and Achieve and feel again each time there's you're pushing further there's more difficulty I never want to feel it again I never want to feel it again but what it did was it showed me what is possible and that's what set the new stage for me that's when I realized oh man I've really been underachieving my entire life I'm not saying that you have to go to that place because that place is a dangerous dangerous place that borderline rabdo heart everything it was borderline rabo it was all that y but you don't you don't want to go there but it taught me what is possible so from that 19-hour lesson one the best biggest lesson had my life it it taught me like okay I got it check tell me about this mixed type of hate that you've made so what started happening is as you get bigger as you get more successful you open the door for people to critique every [ __ ] thing you do and most of the people who are critiquing you usually aren't where you are and all their critiquing comes from people who are really at a low level of life which is sad but what we do people who are on the upper level hearing the haters at the lower level like I said you'll never meet a hater doing better than you true statement I started having fun with it so I'll go through the comments while while most people don't go through comments I go through and intentionally look for the bad ones and while I'll block and delete you because the people on my page don't need that negative energy I'll block and delete you but I take a snapshot on my phone and I put it in the archive so what happens is there's days where I'm like you know what I really don't want to do this today I'm like oh hang on so I started making these mixtapes with all of these hate messages about people talking [ __ ] and it became such a source of fuel that it was amazing because I know why you hate me you hate me because you're probably in the bed right now you're probably an underachiever you're probably somebody who doesn't want to do anything with your life so I make you question question everything about yourself so I'm going to continue making you question yourself by coming out here and being even more successful so I listen to that while I run I sometimes played in the house and it sometimes gets on Jennifer's [ __ ] nerves because I'm sitting and listen to Somebody talk mad [ __ ] on a loop about me and she's like why do you do this [ __ ] it's half comical and it's half um it's half inspiring I'm actually inspired by it I've heard you say previously that listening to music while you train is cheating MH so what you're telling me MH is that the Silence of your own dark thoughts isn't enough of a soundtrack and you've had to crowdsource insults from the internet self narrate it yep and then play it to yourself while you train that's it I do that sometimes yes yes have you got your phone on your right now I want to hear it no I I don't travel with my phone oh yeah my phone does not go with me anywhere why is that once again man like right now I'm with you a lot of times people are in conversations or they're somewhere they elsewhere you may think they're with you but they're not that phone is the biggest distraction in the world when time so when it comes time for the phone I'm on the phone when not I don't use it I'm all about being present where I'm at so that's why that phone right now no we do have it it's in your it's silenced it's off so I do have my phone right now but but usually I don't take it anywhere go got you so while you're listening to the self- narrated insults of random people on the internet that you don't like right what are you thinking of while you're listening to that while you're working out or while you're walking around the house how that back in the day when I was sometimes getting bullied or in a dark place how sometimes that would have bothered me how I would want to clap back I I would want to be on there all day explaining myself to people and how now I'm in a place now where I can hear it and I can actually enjoy it I can actually know where it's coming from I've studied it so I don't just like listen to it and like make fun of it I actually study it because I was once that negative person I was once that person who saw someone successful and didn't see how can I get there I was like oh [ __ ] that they're probably cheating or they're probably doing this I was I was that negative person because I wasn't there and I didn't want to work to get there so these people who hate on people I've studied them and I've gained a lot of Knowledge from them because I gain a lot of knowledge for myself when I was in that dark place so it's almost like reflecting an older version of you back to yourself 100% I had this idea um uh called the reverse role model so in a lot of places people might grow up and not have good Role Models around them you know like it would be great if I had someone that was my hero that could tell me how to be X uh good in school well with work fantastic in relationships whatever it might be and a lot of people don't grow up with that right and what I realized was cuz that was me in in part from where I was from but I realized there was a lot of people that I got to see that were like the sort of person I didn't want to be like right and that was the reverse role model so I could look around and I could say well I really don't want his relationship with his wife and I hate the way that he is using alcohol to get over the problems in his life he he doesn't have any Integrity or tell the truth she is a liar and a backstabber and a gossip and the thing is that you can actually achieve a lot of success in life by avoiding failure like most success in life actually is avoiding failure yes you need to be able to be competent But first you need to not get out of the race that's the one second decision right you need to not lose before you can win right and the reverse role model is you weaving your way through a selection of people that you don't want to be like and I think that you can get an awfully long way just by doing that I did that my entire life I had the ultimate blueprint by watching my family I was the youngest kid so the youngest kid has the total Advantage you know you may get picked on you may get bullied with everybody but you sit back in the exactly what you said I sat back and watched my dad definitely don't want to do that my mom my brother whoever it may be I sat back and I paid attention to everything around me and it was the ultimate blueprint to how to live life how not to live life how not to live life is I watched people do [ __ ] and I said H I don't want to be like that I like what you said about how the criticism that you see from people is coming from a very unique place I think if you got to see the inner texture of the people who don't like use existence you'd feel more pity than anger for the most part I think you'd pity them yes um and that's a realization that's taken a long time for me to to come up with because everybody else feels or to me it always seems like everyone else has got it together because I get to see only what you choose to say only what I'm around you doing that I get to see whereas I get to observe my own inefficiency and foibles 10,000 times a second right I get to watch the texture of my own mind be completely unresponsive and useless I see every single um prideful decision every single lie that I tell myself every single time I make a promise and don't keep it mhm but I don't get to see that from everyone so I'd always presume because of this asymmetry that everybody else had it sorted and I didn't and it also made me think that everybody else's opinion was this perfectly balanced well researched beautifully it was it was they had they had me nailed down to a tea what they were telling me was the truth they could see something in me that I couldn't right and after a little bit of time and a good bit of building up of selfconfidence I realized that that's not the case no I have pity on a lot of people I do um I used to get angry about it like there was this guy I talked about it on on Rogan this guy from s team six who went out there when I became started becoming more famous he went out there and just try to destroy me tried to literally destroy me talked about how you know he just totally lied totally lied had to get a lawyer against him all all kind of [ __ ] and I was getting ready to Sue this guy had a great I was going to sue him because he literally tried to destroy my character my reputation went out there in this lest ass off I thought to myself it's about two months into it I sat back and I started feeling sorry for this guy like really sorry for him I was I was goingon to pull a trigger sue him and I said I'm not gonna Sue this guy I said for you to be this person who comes on and lies and tries to literally tear down everything I've worked for you are in a very very bad place come to find out he was in a very bad mental place so I get what you're saying I've learned to study people before I react because there's no successful person in the world who's in a good head space that's going to ever attack anyone in that kind of manner there's always going to be something wrong with them so you got to always dive a little deeper before you get your feelings hurt before you get your feelings hurt by that bully at school or that boss at work take time take that one second to pull back and study them because most people who are in good places they don't they don't care about what you're doing they don't care about what you're doing they don't try to destroy you they actually will try to build you up versus destroy who you are as a person so that's where I'm at now in life is most people who do that they're in a very

something that that is a constant they think that maybe once I get it I'm gonna hold on to it and that's the thing about that I was telling you I always talk about is nothing is permanent nothing is permanent and a lot of times you have to learn to perform without motivation you have to learn to perform without purpose you have to learn to perform a lot of different things and that's what people think they think I need to have this motivation to work out to study to be better so if they don't have it they just don't [ __ ] do it and that's where you fail you have to learn to train your mind well beyond motivation if you have motivation that's great that's some kindling to the fire all it takes is a little bit of [ __ ] spark you can burn a whole Forest up but motivation you have to learn to exist without it you have to learn to be you have to be your best self when you're least motivated and that's the tricky part about all that [ __ ] motivation is just a word you have to have these different things in your mind on where you want to go and know that motivation is not going to get me there CU I'm not going to always be motivated said the exact same thing you said that discipline needs motivation for breakfast and discipline is good too but without a clear head space there's no discipline what you mean so let's say we have a circuit breaker okay and I'm loading everything up to one [ __ ] circuit just load it up it's gonna [ __ ] blow and once that thing blows man the circuit's all [ __ ] up you got to have each thing plugged into the right SP spot like a [ __ ] crowded garage you can't put anything in it once your brain is crowded discipline is great motivation is great but if you can't fit [ __ ] in your brain because it's all [ __ ] cluttered with [ __ ] there's no discipline you may have it sometimes when it fits in that crowded garage of your mind but you don't have the consistency that you need to have with that discipline so what are you talking about here are you saying doing self work and reflecting on you as an individual are you doing therapy call I call it my I call it mental zones I don't get into it much because it be all day but basically is you're organizing your mind so you can put that discipline so a lot of people talk about discipline okay great why do you fall off the [ __ ] wagon why can't I continue with this routine going to the gym being better waking up early eating the right Foods it's because maybe it's your kids maybe it's your wife maybe it's your job and it's all just stuffed in your [ __ ] brain you don't have it compartmentalized and organized in these nice shelves like you look in a garage it's all [ __ ] a nice organized militant garage hey where are my dumbbells right there a lot of people whose brain Hey where's my Dum H let me look they're [ __ ] throwing [ __ ] they're looking through totes they're all [ __ ] up so where am I going to put discipline in that mind if I can't find other [ __ ] you got to be able to find all these different things in your mind oh I can put discipline right there I can put consistency right there I can put all these things right there in that spot so that's what I'm talking about if your life is not organized in your life being everything around you because it takes one little [ __ ] up piece of an outside interference to Cutter your whole mind because it's on such a knife edge that's right and people don't get that your mind has to always be clear that's why Mo that's why I meditate two hours every single night because I refresh I reorganize the garage which is my mind every night so then discipline's in there organization everything is in this right spot so when I wake up I'm ready to go what does a morning look like for you at the moment have you got a routine of some kind yes I run every single morning so that's what time you up when are you waking up I'm up about 5 5:30 so every morning starts with a run and that's because that's the one thing I hate to do more than anything in the world so that's like my cup of coffee and I'm all about armoring yourself so the second you leave your house and the second you open your phone the second you do any of that [ __ ] you are now letting them poison in cancer so I make sure a lot of things you can't avoid so as I get up I start to armor plate my mind and body like a person's going to war you put your body armor on that's what I'm doing on that run I'm waking up and I'm giving myself all this armor so when I come out in the world now look at that phone I'm ready I'm not waking up late I'm not rushing around I'm not disorganized because I know I'm gonna get hit in the [ __ ] mouth there's a there's an art to getting hit in the [ __ ] mouth and that is why these things are important you have to wake up and you have to give yourself belief you have to give yourself confidence so that it starts with that run so after the run I come home I eat something small how long's the Run typically at the moment nowhere Under 12 miles so 12 miles is the minimum and what are you getting that done in how long it depends right now I'm running a heart rate so I'm running like 815s 830s cuz I'm retraining right now because is that zone two for you zone two because of the leg I had so I'm going back starting from scratch so anywhere from about an hour 30 to two hours I run every day mhm so that's so you're fasted on the morning up straight out straight out 90 minutes to two hours of running back eat eat and I'm in the gym so and then after that um to whatever's on the plan for the day that's how that works every day are you still doing your stretching cuz you've got two hours of you've got two hours of meditation 90 minutes to 2 of running MH how long's the gym session depends 45 to an hour and a half okay mhm stretching meditation run M eat gy M what is that my missing Jennifer oh yeah yeah forgot about that you cycle as well yeah how long are you cycling it just depends I do stationary bike right now a lot uhuh what do youing is it like a wat bike or something similar yeah something similar so I put my bike on a uh like trainer M and I cycle yep at least three or four days a week I'll do that so that's your day there's no there's there is no room for anything else yeah there is a lot of room so there's 24 hours and I and I use it all pretty pretty well how's your sleep what's your sleep L it's really good okay getting eight hours is something like that seven eight hours mhm yeah well you need to with this sort of volume 78 hours and you're still doing your stretching stuff every night so you've got a 4H hour block basically of stretching meditation that's all in one block you combine the two right yeah that's all in one block cool yep that's one hell of a day it is and it's been like that for seven years but going back to what you said before about needing to cap success MH you wouldn't be able to fit even one tenth of that in exactly if you were chasing down exactly yep that's exactly it so if all that's [ __ ] up that's why I got a cap success because I can't put that in and and that's my growth factor so you know that's that's my human growth factor you said before about um how you build up self-esteem and confidence and stuff and there's this quote from one of my friends Alex hosi that says you don't become Confident by shouting affirmations in the mirror but by having a stack of undeniable proof that you are who you say you are outwork your self-doubt yes that's that's nailed nailed completely nailed yes because a lot of people will in some of these motiv ation people out here it's It's the funniest thing in the world to me they'll go and say when you wake up in the morning pound your chest you know [ __ ] look at yourself in the mirror and do all this [ __ ] [ __ ] I hope it works what works for me is that everyday resume the things I know I've accomplished the things I know I've done real hard work the real calluses on my mind the real calluses on my hands that's that's it that you don't need to pound your chest in the mirror of the [ __ ] anymore if you have that it seems like especially with confidence right or self-esteem there's a relationship between confidence and competence so what you're looking to do is try and have what you believe that you can do be ahead of what you can do now you're not looking for it to be delusional you don't want it to to be able to believe that you can do something like fly right but you need to have a relationship between the two but what people are asking for is for their confidence to be so far ahead of their competence that or without having even been competent at anything in the beginning and that's just delusion that's fantasy right well I believe that you have to build belief belief is like there's an after school special belief where the mom says believe in yourself and that's all great but there's also a built belief and the built belief is one where you are constantly like for me I came from a bad place How I build belief is through the the daunting tasks I put myself through so that's proof positive that I can't so it correlates and that's how this piece of [ __ ] kid I once thought I was built belief by saying hm I was in three hell weeks I went to Ranger school I tried out for Delta selection undeniable stock of proof that is proof [ __ ] so whenever you think whenever you think you can't confidence comes from the thing that you built you must build belief you must build confidence it can't be like he um I'm going go knock that [ __ ] out you got to look over here and say I can knock that [ __ ] out it's belief and it's built on what you put in to yourself another friend sent me a a message this morning knowing that we had this this big thing that we've working toward for a long time today he said uh nature said I know of no better life purpose than to perish in attempting the great and impossible the fact that something seems impossible shouldn't be a reason to not pursue it that's exactly what makes it worth pursuing where would the courage and greatness be if success was certain and there was no risk the only true failure is shrinking away from life's challenges na that one also two for two na that one also man yeah it's that um it's that dealing with laziness and self-doubt thing I think uh and I do wonder how many people use the look in the mirror pound the chest stare into your eyes say your affirmations don't get the results and then lose confidence well that's part of it a lot of it is limit to Horizons limited Horizons are like I use me as an example always I came from a small town in Indiana where there was a handful of black families and a lot of people in that town when you come from a town of 8,000 people it's like we had a local plant Great Dane you're like you know what I want to work at Great Dane and get a house next to my mom that's what you know so many of us come from these small places in our mind that we're not willing to think outside of only what we've seen our mind works in such a small compartment and one thing I was able to do was to dream many people but don't make dreams your [ __ ] m Master but I was able to dream outside those [ __ ] Four Walls of that small town and until you're able to really put yourself into that dream but don't make dreams your master that's where you truly become what you're destined to become what you mean don't make dreams your master a lot of people sit back and they dream about being a sports figure or dream about being a seal or dream about being an astronaut all it is is a [ __ ] dream they don't put the work behind the dream that dream has become their [ __ ] Master when you become the master of your [ __ ] dream is when you say I want to go be a Navy SEAL and you say okay I'm gonna lose 106 pounds and less than three [ __ ] months the dream was the one thing I thought about and the dream was now gone now what comes in the dream goes away and the [ __ ] laundry list of [ __ ] details and tasks come up got do this gotta do this gotta do this gotta do this that's when you become the master of your dream so a lot of people out there dreaming Ryan holiday says talking about the thing and doing the thing V for the same resources allocate yours appropriately that's it that's it that's the way it works as well that's the way that the brain works you can actually get these kicks of dopamine by telling your friends about I'm going to be a Navy SEAL I'm going to start my training next week it's going to be great I'm gonna feel like this feels good it feels good to talk about that [ __ ] man it actually makes you feel good makes you feel proud all that [ __ ] but guess what happens that alarm clock goes off at 4:00 am. to train I want to be a seal today or I don't want to be whatever today I'll start tomorrow and that's the usual pattern of people's lives that's why I talk about clearing out the mind until you really want to do something you're always G to be a talker you always get run your [ __ ] mouth so again with the audio version of this book you've done podcasts in between each chapter where you're recapping what's just happened and this time you brought guests one of which was your mother right and you spend a 35 minute conversation sitting down with her and talking about the experiences that she had with your father and reflecting on that right a lot of stuff you'd elected to leave out of the first book so that means there's been a journey that you've gone through to get to the stage where both you and her and collaboratively you felt okay sharing that publicly right like what's that process like CU your mom didn't ask for this I mean you kind of also did you put a book out there because you thought it was useful and now millions and millions of people know about you but right you know the uh gravity field of your notoriety is starting to bring other people in as well so what was the Journey of getting to that stage like well it wasn't so much me I had already laid out you know a lot of [ __ ] about me that was you know pretty embarrassing and can't hurt me so for her her that actually helped her out she said wow if you had the courage to go out there and tell people all your [ __ ] you know and so that process was it it took about four years of me working with my mom because you know she was very damaged by what she went through and so was I but I knew no one was coming to save me so I had to go ahead and fix my [ __ ] and she kind of lived in a different place but when I wrote can't hurt me it started waking her up that hey man why do you care why do you care so much what people think about you what you went through why why are you putting so much so much on other people and what they may say about you like there's some stuff I talk about you know that is pretty embarrassing for some people but she got to a point in her life where she was able to you know stop caring because we all have our [ __ ] no one that like people it's so funny to me there be people who are out here commentating about people who are [ __ ] up out here famous people are [ __ ] up and I don't know how they're able to do that when I guarantee while your skeletons are not being out there if I were to open up your [ __ ] door [ __ ] how how how are you doing that so I know that about everybody like people love to talk [ __ ] about somebody and keep themselves out of it and so we went through that journey together and so it allowed her to come out and say yeah [ __ ] it you know I'm I'm a big person who I want to get people to confidence to walk in the room of a million people and none of them like you and you just like say [ __ ] you I'm good and walk out with you by yourself you helped your mom do that as well and now she can look at everybody and say yeah I [ __ ] married a [ __ ] that choked the woman to death I was in a bad place I'm good with that one of the days that you focus on a good bit in that conversation is the day that she decided to leave your father right and take you and your brother with her MH was there anything that you learned about upon reflection MH where both of your experiences uh opened up a new realization to you that that was a hard time for her and for me also I was ready to leave a long time ago I was just waiting for her to get the courage to finally leave him and um I don't think anything from that really I think that's where the damage really began I think for her when she left it almost her fight went away and it's kind of like when you run 100 miles when you sit down your body can then say exactly what I was thinking I'm done exactly what I was thinking the second she left that the Mind said oh my God like we can we can be human it's like PTSD yes we can be human and we're not fighting anymore and it just swarmed the demons that all that fight and all that [ __ ] was keeping away it just came and it swallowed it swallowed her whole and it also swallowed me whole but once again like we're were talking about I got a chance to watch her and she set out the ultimate blueprint on how not to be so I had a hard time learning growing up but I was very smart when it came to human beings a genius because I lived in such hell I was always studying people who can I trust who can I not trust energy I I got really good with energy can I is this person's energy good is it bad so I became a genius on human beings so I studied people all the time studied all the time she also talks about considering taking her own life oh yeah were you aware of that before you started working toward this book yeah so yeah she she talked about that a few times with me you know behind closed doors and um I'm I'm I'm I'm surprised she didn't you know there's a lot of stories that are still ont told that she probably will never talk about and I'll never talk about them until she says it's fine but um yeah it was it was a bad it was it was a bad way so I I I give her credit for having the strength to say okay I need to continue on and figure out you know what's next for me which she says the only reason that she didn't go through with it is because of you and your brother because she knew that she would be leaving you in the hands of this Tyrant that was going to mistreat you even more badly now that she wasn't around to protect you yeah which is a it's beautiful but it's also kind of a lot of pressure it feels like a lot of pressure for a child to be the reason for his mother to to still be there and it's also a damning conclusion about the state of her life right that the only thing stopping you from taking your own life is these two boys but it's also beautiful in a way because a lot of people only have one thing you don't need a lot of things sometimes only thing that kept me with that one step forward was one thing and so that one thing can get you to two things to three things to four things so that was the beautiful thing about that is that now she's 75 and she's retired because of that one thing how I mean you you're having this conversation with your mom during the production of the audio book you're having a conversation which is difficult to have in private right with two microphones in front of you knowing full well that this is going out to millions of people it's going to be scrutinized it's going to be listened to it's going to be reflected on Y how difficult is it to watch your mother opening up about an experience which to you was traumatic and then reopening those wounds in front of you and talking about that for millions of people to hear oh it's it's hard it's hard but it's necessary why to be able to own your trauma to be able to own everything about you and look it in the eye like there's a part in Eight Mile with Eminem the very end when this white boy you know [ __ ] trying to make it in the rap world and getting beat down and [ __ ] comes from some trailer park [ __ ] and he's like how the [ __ ] am I GNA win this rap battle because my best friend got shot in the foot and this dude slept with my girl and all this [ __ ] so what he does to take all the power from the [ __ ] gonna rap battle his ass he's like I'm going to tell you every [ __ ] thing about me I'm just going to [ __ ] tell you and that's how I feel about life and that's how my mom now feels about life I'm just gonna [ __ ] tell you everything a [ __ ] about me I'm not gonna hide I'm not gonna do none of this [ __ ] and it's a refreshing feeling when you can get in front of millions of people get audiobook and you can go through your [ __ ] and lay it out and you walk away there's no more secrets there's no more secrets like when people say oh hey Lance Armstrong did you do steroids no no no yes while I have nothing I have nothing wrong with Lance Armstrong or anybody else just [ __ ] tell the [ __ ] man and guess what happens to the conversation it's over it [ __ ] ends there's a really telling Moment In the book I think it's my favorite part and it's not even in this one it's in the audio book and it's when it's getting quite difficult with your mom mhm and you offer her a root out you ask if she wants to take a break y she says no I want to keep going so it seems like she's got a bit of that dog in her as well oh yeah she had to yeah she had to one one thing that when you grow up the way we kind of grew up together that's how I look at it when you grew up when she had you and she had J 28 and my brother at 24 so um after that you know we grew up together and you got to have a dog you you have to have a dog in you man and so you have to have like like my grandfather called it a stiff upper lip you better have a stiff upper lip so you know yeah she has some dog in her she has some dog in her she has to there's no other way to make it out here I mean you can't just always be you know head down in the sand you gotta learn to pick yourself up on your own a lot of times these fights and these battles you got to be your own [ __ ] coach you got to be your own motivator and she had do that several times in her life given all of this trauma that you go through why would you choose to go back and see this Tyrant of a father for one last time it was the only way for me to move forward so like a lot of times if your back is hurting it may not be your [ __ ] back it may be something else in your body that's making your back hurt for me I'm like man why can't I get past this [ __ ] hurdle so like I said I'm always is examining myself every day what is it what is it well there's only one thing you haven't examined yet and it's going back to the Beast going back to the demon so when I went back to him I realized that that was the unsolved mystery was I had to look that man the eye one more time like how I studied the that Navy SEAL talking [ __ ] and lion I got it from this part right here in the book I went and I didn't see him any any more as this Beast I started doing research on him found out that his dad used to beat him really bad so my his his dad would put him in front of a furnace open the furnace up with the Flames coming out and put him right in front of it have him bare but naked and he would whip the [ __ ] out of him and the whole idea of that is if you move you're going to get burned so stay right here and take your [ __ ] beat so what happened with him those demons from his father went to my father and he tried to transfer him over to me I had to understand who my father was understand where he came from understand why were you so [ __ ] brutal to us I got my answers took those answers and made myself better from the ansers about him and so that's why it was necessary for me to go back not I was looking for an AP ology so then maybe I could just go be a loser and understand that you [ __ ] me up why would the apology make you a loser it would make no it would make me feel Vindicated Justified yes like man you you did this to me I can go be a loser now my failings are okay this okay yep because you did this so I was looking for that and when I went there I I realized because his voice in him was saying it's not your dad's fault and I'm like n a man because this voice over here always said it's your dad's fault this other voice started tuning in was loud started getting louder the more I drove to Buffalo was saying you got to face a lot of [ __ ] young man you got a long journey ahead of you because you're gonna find out that while your dad did a lot of [ __ ] to you you're gonna have to [ __ ] make it on your own and the voice got louder and louder and louder and by time I got to that door and by time I was leaving that house instead of me feeling sorry for myself I started to doing live autopsy because a lot of people when you die they figure out why you died they figure out how you died in the autopsy but we never do live autopsy to figure out why we're dying while we are alive and I was dying I was living every day but I was really dead and so I figured it out and once I figured it out I was able to reborn I was able to be reborn what we see is this pattern of generational trauma your grandfather to your father your father to you father to son just being passed on passed on passed on is this part of your mission to be a circuit breaker to be a a dam to stop this Trauma from moving forward into the Next Generation 100% but with people I'm trying to build people up I'm trying to armor their mind I'm trying to get the the belief because this world we live in is tough it's tough it will beat you down the world and the life that we live in is the ultimate competitor it will try to take you out it will it will find your weakness and it will [ __ ] just Hammer you it's like a personal curse 100% so if I can help you build belief build confidence to the point where nothing can hurt you because you know exactly who you are you've faced your demons you've you've been able to go on an audio book in your mind maybe you didn't write a book but in your mind you were able to hear all your past traumas you were able to listen to them you're able to [ __ ] say okay now I can now talk to people about what I went through I'm no longer embarrassed I'm no longer ashamed being ashamed is one of the biggest things that kill people nowadays in their minds kill them from moving forward I'm ashamed of myself don't ever be ashamed of anything you've done in your life face it fix it make it better we are humans but then again if you always think that we're humans you will always just be a human and always make the same [ __ ] mistakes you must take this knowledge that you learn from all this [ __ ] is knowledge so I'm just trying to give people that strength to go in the archives of your life because while you're probably [ __ ] up it's probably something happened to you in your life go through the archives dig it up study it and then use it for yourself that's that's the main purpose for me right now have you considered what you would be like as a father yeah I actually have a daughter right now yeah no way I didn't know yeah I have a daughter right now but that being said I'm an open honest person when you meet people at a young age so I had a kid at a young age when I was in the worst possible place in my life so when you're in a bad place you're not going to meet a Kish you're going to meet a person that's very similar to who you are at that time and then you bring a child into this world and as you start to move up in this world and get better and you realize I need to get better you try to pull that person along with you a lot of times they don't want to come where you're going and it creates a bad environment so that's where that is right now talking but my daughter's 21 years old though wow yeah I'm glad to hear that I think I I think that uh it would be all of the learnings and stuff that you've been through as a father as a son as a grandson um it makes sense to me that that would have been a something that could have been passed down mhm so thinking about uh trauma and stuff that you go through in your past um throughout most of school for me I was pretty isolated only child uh pretty unpopular in school and the main issue that I had was it wasn't bullying it was isolation I think it was being lonely right um and that was primarily what was causing me to be sad throughout school right so I do this interview for the BBC about six months ago and uh in it I talk about I haven't opened up that much about bullying I I need to to do it more and it is you know even from watching you go through opening up about your traumas it is inspiring uh so I do this interview for the BBC and I mention a little bit about bullying in school and so why don't you mention it I haven't got around to it yet I I maybe still feel like it detracts from the man that I want to be the masculine man the um respected podcaster that it somehow undermines me as a person that it makes me weaker which is obviously what was you know part of the bullying's purpose in school to be able to do precisely that right so I do this interview for the BBC and I mentioned in two paragraphs or something but millions of people see this article uh and I get back one day and in my Instagram message requests is this message from a guy and I kind of recognize his name but not not fully and I don't know whether you know but there's like a character limit in Instagram so and this is five character limit messages long with multiple paragraphs within each of them right so I open it up uh and this guy says uh hi Chris you might not remember me but we went to school together uh I bullied you my daughter is four and she's about to go to school and given that she's about to go to school me and my wife have been discussing about the kind of child that we want her to be and that caused me to reflect on my time that I spent in school I saw I've been thinking about messaging you for a while I've been considering talking to you uh because I really felt like I needed to because I felt ashamed of the way that I treated you in school and I knew that it had hurt you uh and then I saw this article from the BBC and I just had to reach out and I've been sleepless nights speaking to the wife tears and all the rest of it uh and I just wanted to say that I'm sorry uh I'm very sorry for what I did um I wanted to let you know that my daughter is going to be raised in a way that will never treat anybody like that again um I don't expect you to forgive me I don't even know if you'll see this message I'm happy to see that you seem to be happy um but I I needed to get it off my chest right I'm like [ __ ] totally taken a back like wasn't prepared for this I have come back in from the gym or something and I'm sat reading this message like [ __ ] hell that's heavy so I go back through and I think well how do I feel about this how do I feel about this person how do I feel about my experience right um because it was so formative right it shaped so much of the way that I see myself the way that I see the world I had to deprogram so much of the patterns that I'd learned right through that time um my desire for validation from other people right U my need to be liked my constant vigilance my ambient anxiety that was always looking for what was going on my concern of being left out y my adamant uh that everybody was um able to judge something about me that I didn't know about myself y but this guy had like fully fully opened up to me and I thought well you know it was beautiful it was a beautiful message um so I replied to him and I said hey man um I very much appreciate you reaching out I think it's an incredibly Brave thing to do and if me going through what I went through and then the pain and discomfort and such and your subsequent suffering of reflecting on what you did MH if that has led to a world in which your daughter will be the sort of person who will behave in a manner that's going to make the world a better place going forward I think that's a price that's worth paying that's awesome man that's that's a great story that's a great story and you're the you're the expert on it that's why you should talk about bullying I know yeah you're the expert and that's why I do it you know um that's why I become I i' I've become so vulnerable because all that knowledge you gain because now you are successful and there's so many people who are getting bullied in so many ways that you know you just show them that there's a path but the path is really like I talk about studying the the bully that's the path studying the bully were you ever tempted to become a bully never never I'm always like I said like I told you before this started I wanted to be a priest I want to be a priest you know and um could you imagine one of those sermons oh it'd be sick because I because I would cuss because I would I would definitely cuss praise the Lord [ __ ] that's it I would definitely cuss I would definitely cuss man because that's that's the world and there's a lot of people hear this like oh my God that's this is oh my God let me close my ear you know this the world's tough the world's tough and when you come up the way I came up the only way I can [ __ ] describe something sometimes to say [ __ ] a [ __ ] because that's how dark this [ __ ] was and I can't make it flowery I can't make it PG like oh I want my kids to like I have a clean edition of this book have oh you have a non-explicit version yes because people like I want my I want my kid to read your book but you but you cuss so much I can't I imagine it's about half the size yes it's very small yes so so the funny thing about it is like how long are you going to shelter your child from a world that's evil as [ __ ] that's going to come at you it's going to come at you whether you've been bullied or not there's going to come a time when it's going to come at you and it's G to be a lot worse than [ __ ] or [ __ ] it's G to be a lot worse and so we are training kids and people to be soft in a world that continuously gets harder and it doesn't it doesn't correlate like that guy talking about the tear gas with the seals is that necessary I don't know but what is necessary is you have to build a person that can withstand the pressures of whatever they're going to be dealing with in life and we don't do that I'm not trying to send a message of run 200 miles be the bad [ __ ] in the world but be tough you better have a part about you that's tough a part about you that can break down situations and get better and break down situations very quickly within some trauma in your life some Devastation in your life because it's going to come the devastation the trauma is going to come and you can't allow that to become a jersey barrier it can't be a jersey barrier it has to be something that you can maneuver through very quickly and move forward that takes a lot of toughness well unchosen suffering is going to happen right so the only thing that you can do is have some chosen suffering to prepare for it it's the only thing you can do that's the only thing you can practice for the unchosen suffering is have chosen suffering do something that's sucks every day I had hubman on the show a few months ago and he told me about bringing you into his lab and putting you in VR underwater with sharks right give me your experience with huberman he's great he he knows his stuff he knows his stuff um yeah he's just a he's a very knowledgeable man on what he's doing what's being in VR with sharks like it's nothing no no no because one thing about me is I deal in reality you put me in VR as VR it's a fake thing and I work in reality I only work in reality I don't work in fake situations so that's why it didn't work on me you put me in a real ocean with real sharks you'll get your real reaction you put me in a room that I when you walk in the door and you sit down in the chair and you put some [ __ ] on your [ __ ] face I know I'm in a [ __ ] chair I know I'm in a room if you get that psyched the [ __ ] out you need to study that more than that you know what I'm saying yeah why are you so sensitive why you so if you are on a high wire because you're afraid of heights but you're sitting firmly on the [ __ ] ground you need to study the fact that you're doing something wrong don't study the freight of heights study why the [ __ ] do I know I'm on the [ __ ] ground in a [ __ ] chair but I'm afraid of what's on this screen so I don't allow anything to go beyond the truth he said that um obviously you didn't know this in advance it could have been the most lifelike VR in the history of the world and apparently it was a group of you guys and someone had to go first someone had to go first you're not that good with water not sure how you feel about sharks but can't imagine you're a fan um and you would just like me me please I'm first yeah I'm like that with everything because why I sit back in the back and think about let me watch you go first you can watch me go first is there anything that you'd like to study with huberman would there be any like cool tests is there anything that you've been thinking about to do with performance or anything like that at the moment no you've just got your own mental lab you're doing everything lab every everything I need is in my mental lab everything because I'm in constant study of myself that's and I know what needs to be conquered because I'm constantly going through what I don't like what I'm not comfortable with you know like I'm I know and only I can fix these problems because I have to face these problems so I have a rolling a rolling log on what needs to happen so I'm I'm really good about being accountable about okay you need to be better here you need be better here you need to overcome this overcome that and I do a good job of doing that you talk about performance without a purpose M what's that so like for instance let's say you have no races let's say you have no classes no nothing you have there's no purpose in your life you know people need to have purpose to get up they need purpose to perform you need to get to a point in your life where there's nothing on the docket there's no 5K there's no there's no um I'm going to get into school to be this or that and still perform to the highest level because what people don't get is one day that thing's going to come up and if you're not constantly performing without purpose you're not going to be ready when the time comes it's this magical thing purpose that we're all looking for but what's funny about it all is that we need these things to perform but we don't take a second to realize the purpose is always there the purpose never leaves us because the very purpose is you you are always the purpose there may be another purpose like being a seal or going to college or whatever but the main purpose in life is you so if you wake up in the morning and you don't want to do something you don't care enough about yourself and that's what you need to really research is man why am I not doing this for myself because that is that is the number one purpose in life is to better oneself so that's the only purpose I [ __ ] need so the reason I get up every day even though there's no race or there's no school there's nothing in front of me is because I have pride in myself but where do you go to you wake up on the morning it's cold it's wet it's dark you've got no cartilage in your knee you've got shitty shorts whatever it is that's the issue today keep talking you've got these problems right I need you to keep talking about what you were just saying it's warm on the couch your M say stay in bed it's comfy it's cozy you've got work later on you had an argument last night you're slightly hung over because I know every [ __ ] ain't gonna do what I'm gonna do so this is how you level up that's how you level up I know there's a whole bunch of people with that right there that fires me up that makes me [ __ ] happy what you just said that brings joy to my life right there why because I know there's so many people that have the ability and just refuse to get off that couch refuse to study a few more hours refuse to go deeper to go further and that's where I gained the advantage it's so easy to be great nowadays my friend because most people are weak most people don't want to go to that extra mile most people don't want to find that extra cuz it sucks it's miserable it's lonely you talk about that you were kind of you know Lonely by yourself I was the same way and that used to hurt me growing up now I [ __ ] thrive in that [ __ ] that's the only place to be well that was one of the things that is so surprising about growing up through difficulty you know so loneliness is one example right growing up as a lonely kid what you realize is lot of the things that you feared or hated or embarrassed about as a child end up being the Genesis of the things that you're most proud about as an adult so the fact that you can work and thrive in solitude gives you the opportunity to be able to move to America and start a podcast or decide to do hell week three times in a row or it doesn't matter how long or dark the course is you're just going to stay MH the fact that you were uh forced to be VI and to assess people to work out what's going on when you became an adult allows you to detect the vibe and the energy of whoever it is that you're speaking with and know that this person is someone that I want to hang with and this person's somebody that I don't right all of the things in fact I would go as far as to say there's not one thing in my life that I see as a pure advantage that doesn't have a dark side to it that came about at some other point as well right so one of the reasons that I spent so much time as a kid in my bedroom listening to audio tapes because I didn't have anyone to play with right only child little bit sort of unpopular right so I'd be in my bedroom listening to audio tapes and we go to the library every two weeks and we'd take the tapes back and we get new tapes and i' bring them and listen to them again right but you roll the clock forward 20 years and what's the 2023 version of an audio tape it's a podcast it's a podcast that's right A lot of the things that you love and value in yourself in adulthood are the light side of something that you were ashamed fearful disgusted by when you were younger yeah I mean I think that comes from overcoming a lot of people you know wonder how did you become this how you become so vulnerable how you how are you doing a podcast now when you were this kid you overcame things you fought them and now this is what happens this is on the other side of overcoming it Bec you become very very powerful when you overcome yourself all those things you once cowed from you were afraid of when you face him eye to eye every day you now become a person who has a great podcast let's say that there's someone listening who resonates with what you're talking about you know they've been through trauma they've been through hard times but they keep breaking promises to themselves and they're struggling to get off the couch and they're having a pity party MH how can they stop feeling sorry for themselves that's a difficult one because you have to want it you have to want to be better and it starts off with you have to have pride in yourself you you have to have pride in yourself you have to have there's something about you whether it's your last name whether it's just the smallest thing you have to be proud of yourself and if you have no pride in yourself I can't give it to you because you're always going to compromise you're fold always I'm very proud of myself that's why when people said you no way you can do better than can't hurt me Roger that we'll [ __ ] see it's that Pride that wakes you up now I'm not talking about bad Pride I I'm the attention to detail for the human being I want to do I call this thing like I want to be the standard I want to be that guy like every place I went in the military there was this ethos about how this place is how we're going to live how we're going to represent ourselves and I walked around and I saw that most people didn't live up to that ethos like if you go to whatever whatever company they they had this mission statement on how we want to run our company I made one for myself on how I want to be and that is why if people can make up a mission statement an ethos and which they want to live by and every morning you wake up you hold yourself accountable to that mission not a company is your own make up your own mission statement what do you want to be in life and once you do that now you can work with somebody to get better you can work with yourself to get better but until you know what you want to stand for you will always just be sitting down you'll never stand for anything what's that quote if you don't stand for uh something you'll fall for everything that's it it's a true statement in the book you talk about uh Roger that there being two types of Roger that I absolutely adore the second type uh received orders given expect results that's it that's it so cool above and beyond more than was expected to the letter that's Roger that that is for me what Roger that means received orders given yep expect results expect results that's right so [ __ ] dope that is it that is it and when you hear that from somebody who gets it you know it because you can look in their eyes you feel that energy man it connects immediately they're out here to get a job done Roger that so the start of the book or at least the start of the audio book you've got a few different intros right uh Rogan yep your mom mhm M and The Rock right uh slightly odd trifactor but I do think it works so obviously your time Rogan's had you on now the third time that you've been on what have you learned since being friends with him he's a very singular individual you know what one thing about him is that he's made it and he's all about everybody else making it there's one thing that he believes in is that there's enough food enough cake for everybody out here to eat so there's a lot of people in this world who don't want to see you make it because they think you could take a piece of their pie that motherfucker's like look dude pie for everybody I got 14 pies bro one for every [ __ ] here and so he's all about people making it and that's something that a lot of us can you know learn from that people think oh I made it I'm gonna hold on to it I'm not g to help anybody else out the thing is I don't even know if he was uh something tells me he had that philosophy before he'd even made it yeah as he was on the come up yeah I mean I really didn't know him that much back then but um the he really is to me the Oprah of the modern day he's the Oprah of the modern day you know that that guy just has made so many people known to the world gotten so many messages out so yeah I said uh I was talking to Andrew Schultz about the same thing and he said very similar sentiment especially he's coming from a comedy uh angle right and if you're going to be championed in comedy it's super super difficult right and what he what he said was that uh the comedy world is so zeros some like your gig is not my gig and the fact that you can have someone that just gives that gift out is very rare another friend his wife does iic medicine so it's I'm not really too sure what it is but she did something to do with like tarot card reading okay and he asked her he was about to go on Rogan's podcast so he asked her to do the tarot card readings about Joel because it might give him a little bit more insight or it would just be interesting in general and the tarot card that she pulls out might not be tarot it be something similar the card that she pulled out was um a older Warrior cross-legged sat under a tree with his hands like that this guy did he's got a weapon down next to him weapons laid down transcended the battle and I was like holy [ __ ] I'm I'm not too sure I'm not too sure about what's going on with this tarot card reading thing but that one seems pretty accurate it's probably perfect for him yeah yeah yeah there's something about um raising other people up as you go along oh yeah that you know as you get a platform as you have the opportunity to expose other people that are almost all of your time as a podcaster is slip streaming other people who have bigger platforms and then after a while you get to the stage where you can be that springboard for others right some unbelievably talented person that nobody knows about true statement there you go now the world can know about you he's done the best at that he's the best at that what about the rock if you Haven met him you ever trained with him never never we just dm'd and I was like I'm GNA give you a shot in the dark you know the guy follows me he knows about me whatever I was like this guy's so big man he ain't G [ __ ] it so I D in man within like 20 minutes hey man what's up brother sends me a voice message in DM been following your work man love what you [ __ ] do blah blah blah blah blah oh yeah no problem man I'll I'll hook you up I'll be more than honor to hook you up and in the audio book what people don't know is I left him alone I was like hey man thank you I appreciate it I want to bother you go back to doing the great work that you do you're so busy so I was doing the audio book he was like Hey brother you want me to um you know read what I wrote for you for the Audi book and I was like yeah that's great that's how the idea came about it was actually The Rock's idea for him to do the blurb so then I got Joe Rogan and I got my mom to read the blurs so that came from him I wasn't G to put the blurbs in the audio book but he was like hey man I got a studio right here I'll blast it out send it over to you and we'll get it done that's a training session that the world wants to see I believe so I believe so that should be part of the book tour should be a training a training session between you guys talk me through what the next phase of your life has in store um so after this podcast I probably won't do another one for a very long time and I did my book came out on the 6th it's now the 16th I did my 10 days of the book and now it's done and now it's going back to the lab so now I go back go back to firefighting go back to finding another level of David gogins and that's done in quiet areas and finding more of myself finding these these spaces I haven't you know discovered yet in my mind and I really love that about life I love mastering self I love it I love it there there there's nothing more because I know where I came from and it's amazing that where I came from that person could have died that very fat lazy unfulfilled person and with inside that person was this person talking to you is very freaky to me and a lot of us have these two people that you have greatness way over here but you decide to live in this space over here because between greatness or between this space here and greatness there's a lot of [ __ ] work there's so much space to fill in with work and we just say [ __ ] it I just stay over here in this space so I like to [ __ ] examine all these spaces and there's there's still more there's still more still a lot more are you aiming to find peace at any point think about this I love that question I'm glad you I'm so glad you asked it you you know a little bit about me when you've come from that place I talk about to the place of him now it's not the peace you find it's the peace I find and I find so much peace in looking back at that young David 8 years old with white splashes on his face and stuttering and hair patches falling out and I look at him I'm like man there's so much peace in knowing what I've accomplished and what I've done so my peace may be different for others that's why I never critique or never judge anyone because I don't know your story where you come from I found peace years ago years ago in the battle in the battle you find peace when you go to war with yourself you find a lot of Peace because you know exactly who you are and that is where the peace is really found for me David you're a spectacular individual I really really appreciate your time uh the book is fantastic your message is fantastic uh I can't wait to see what you do next even if it takes 5 years I appreciate it my friend thank you thanks for having me thank you very much for tuning in I really hope that you enjoyed that episode with Goggins it has been six months in the making
