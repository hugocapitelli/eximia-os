[00:00] But guess what happens? That alarm clock
[00:01] goes off at 4:00 a.m. to train.
[00:05] I don't want to be a seal today or I
[00:07] don't want to be whatever today. I'll
[00:09] start tomorrow.
[00:11] You hate me because you're probably in
[00:12] the bed right now. You're probably an
[00:14] underachiever. You're probably somebody
[00:17] who doesn't want to do anything with
[00:19] your life. So I make you question
[00:24] everything about yourself. One thing I
[00:26] did wrong in my life was I tried for so
[00:28] many years to please people
[00:32] and I did it at the expense of myself.
[00:37] I was leaving a lot in the tank and I
[00:40] and when you do that you stop living and
[00:42] you will live exactly the way you live
[00:44] now questioning who you are wondering
[00:47] what is possible wondering what you are
[00:50] capable of doing that's how that looks
[00:52] or you can be me which am I happy
[00:56] I don't know never thought about it
[00:58] don't really care about it cuz all I
[01:00] really cared about was I looked in that
[01:01] [ __ ] mirror I saw a piece of [ __ ]
[01:04] happiness wasn't on the mirror at
[01:07] around 300 lb. It wasn't like I'm
[01:09] looking for happiness. No, I'm looking
[01:12] at myself in the mirror and said, "All
[01:13] right, [ __ ] You did it again
[01:15] today." I had to stop thinking normal. I
[01:18] had to stop thinking normal. I can no
[01:21] longer be a common man walking around
[01:23] doing common things. But no one taught
[01:25] me this stuff. It wasn't like I had, you
[01:27] know, I paid a trainer to come train me.
[01:30] Jenny Craig didn't come down and miracle
[01:31] my ass. None of this happened. It was on
[01:34] me. I became obsessed.
[01:38] I became obsessed with being the baddest
[01:41] [ __ ] that God ever created. Am I
[01:43] that? I don't care. I believe it. And I
[01:46] was trying to tell him, once you become
[01:47] obsessed with something, obsessed. It's
[01:50] okay to be unbalanced for a while. It's
[01:53] okay. Don't be all this stuff people
[01:55] say, you got to be balanced. To be the
[01:58] best in the world at what you do. It's
[02:01] not about being a Navy Seal, people. The
[02:03] best at what you do. You have to be on
[02:05] balance to find every bit of [ __ ]
[02:08] energy and strength that you have to
[02:10] pull it off. I don't look at anything as
[02:12] failure because when you're willing to
[02:13] try to do something, not trying is
[02:16] failure. That's that's and that's not
[02:19] some after school special [ __ ] but when
[02:21] you're able to go out there, there there
[02:22] is no failure. It's attempts. Cuz when
[02:24] you're trying to do something that's
[02:26] bigger than you, whatever you are,
[02:28] whoever you are, if if if you're
[02:30] paralyzed, you're trying to walk one
[02:31] step and you didn't. You didn't fail,
[02:33] [ __ ] That was your first
[02:34] attempt.
[02:35] >> If that's your biggest thing, that's how
[02:38] your mindset needs to go into
[02:39] everything. So, I don't look at it as
[02:41] failure is a big word like that gets
[02:43] people down and [ __ ] We give so much
[02:45] power to words. I don't no one's going
[02:48] to miracle me to be somebody special.
[02:51] Everybody that call me [ __ ] my dad,
[02:53] my mom, all my situations were on me now
[02:56] and solely on me. In 2013,
[03:00] people wanted me to write my book. I did
[03:02] it in 2018. Took five years. And the
[03:06] reason why I didn't do it, I sat at the
[03:08] table and Jennifer was there. This
[03:10] before I I I she started working for me.
[03:12] I started dating or whatever. And all
[03:14] these people are there. And they're
[03:15] like, "Man, you got to go on social
[03:17] media." And I was like, "Fuck you, man.
[03:20] Like, I'm not that's it's it's poison.
[03:23] It's poison." Because I knew what I did
[03:25] to get where I am. And I'm going to have
[03:27] these people, these normal everyday
[03:30] people, fat, lazy, in exactly who I was
[03:36] judging me cuz I know it cuz I was once
[03:39] them. Failure is the ultimate thing,
[03:41] man. I failed so many times before.
[03:44] That's why I don't look at failure
[03:45] anymore as failure. I look as my first,
[03:47] second, and third attempt to be at the
[03:49] point of your life where you don't care
[03:52] about being judged. You can be in a room
[03:54] of a million people and they all hate
[03:55] you and you walk in and you go like this
[03:58] because not because you're angry at
[04:00] them, because you know yourself
[04:04] inside and out and you know that you've
[04:05] put yourself through hell to be where
[04:08] you're at today. You've walked the walk.
[04:10] You've talked the talk and you've walked
[04:12] the walk. And that's to me what it's all
[04:16] about.
[04:17] You have to make the decision whether
[04:20] you want to be a badass or whether you
[04:22] want just want to be mediocre and
[04:24] everything's okay. A good painter will
[04:26] not just paint.
[04:29] He needs to create. And you can't create
[04:32] with phones and everything going around
[04:34] you. So, you got to block yourself off.
[04:37] You only do two podcasts in a year. You
[04:40] block yourself off and you're and you're
[04:41] painting this thing inside and you're
[04:44] going through all these different colors
[04:45] of paint and everything else and you can
[04:48] only figure out the right painting if
[04:50] you spend the correct amount of time in
[04:52] your brain. You have to face that in
[04:54] that dark room. In that dark room is who
[04:57] you are.
[04:59] >> But in that dark room is where you have
[05:01] to create another human being that walks
[05:04] out of that dark room to face who you
[05:07] are. That's the only way you're going to
[05:09] get over all those things. So,
[05:12] basically, a lot of us aren't prepared
[05:13] for life. We get up willy-nilly and just
[05:16] hope life is going to happen. It is
[05:18] going to happen, but it's going to
[05:20] happen with a prepared mind or an
[05:22] unprepared mind. Most people attack life
[05:25] with the unprepared mind. What I do is I
[05:28] try to account for all things that could
[05:31] happen, might happen, probably will
[05:33] happen, and then the unknowns.
[05:35] Whenever you think you can't, the
[05:38] confidence comes from the thing that you
[05:40] built. You must build belief. You must
[05:43] build confidence. It can't be like,
[05:46] "Hey, um, I'm going to go knock that
[05:48] [ __ ] out." You got to look over here and
[05:52] say, "I can knock that [ __ ] out." It's a
[05:56] belief and it's built on what you put in
[05:59] to yourself. I had to miserably wake up
[06:03] every morning in the cold cuz it was
[06:05] Indiana, November when it started. I was
[06:08] miserable.
[06:11] This is your new life.
[06:14] Take it or leave it. There's no
[06:16] happiness about it. There's no peace
[06:18] behind it. It sucks. You got to live
[06:21] with that. I live with it for a lot of
[06:23] years. And so I sat back and said,
[06:25] "Okay, all right. I know what this
[06:28] takes." And when you sit back,
[06:31] >> as [ __ ] up as I was, and I had a
[06:35] laundry list, a a table like this of
[06:37] what I have to do to become just a human
[06:40] being. I understand that guy. I
[06:43] understand exactly where you're coming
[06:45] from. That is your personal opinion and
[06:47] I totally get that. But
[06:52] there's very few people in this world
[06:54] who want to do a job like that. And it
[06:56] takes a different kind of mindset.
[06:59] Is it tear grass appropriate? I don't
[07:02] know.
[07:03] How hard that training is, I don't
[07:06] expect anybody to understand it but 1%.
[07:10] But the loud voices of this world are
[07:14] the 99% who don't understand exactly
[07:16] what you have to do. I was I became the
[07:19] most obsessed person on the planet
[07:21] earth. And I was basically
[07:24] I had to invent a guy that didn't exist.
[07:28] I lived a life so disciplined that
[07:31] everybody that I once looked to these
[07:34] fake characters, I I I built that as a
[07:37] man.
[07:39] And when I was younger, I had this image
[07:42] in my mind of what does a man look like
[07:44] to me? And I got all these people who
[07:47] were badasses characters.
[07:51] And in my mind, I became that. I don't
[07:55] quit. You know, I may not make it the
[07:57] first time,
[07:58] >> but I'll come back. I got to call
[08:00] audible. I got to [ __ ] I got to I got
[08:02] to [ __ ] get my head back in the game.
[08:04] I got to I got to figure this [ __ ] out.
[08:07] It doesn't mean you leave. It means you
[08:08] study it more. When do you rest?
[08:12] >> When do you recover?
[08:13] >> Yeah. And I don't want to scare people,
[08:17] but the truth answer is
[08:20] I don't take any days off that I turned
[08:25] a person this [ __ ] up into this
[08:28] [ __ ] right here. Not off of
[08:31] reading a [ __ ] book off a theorist,
[08:34] off of going to work on myself and
[08:37] saying, "I don't know how to do this."
[08:40] But I know that to get over there to
[08:42] that [ __ ] side, I got to grind myself
[08:45] into a [ __ ] fine powder.
[08:49] And I did it. If you want to be great,
[08:52] you want to be badass [ __ ] ever
[08:54] at what you do, you're going to be
[08:56] misunderstood by everybody because
[08:59] you're going to be so [ __ ] obsessed
[09:00] and so driven to get there. And that's
[09:02] what it takes.
[09:02] >> That's the truth.
[09:03] >> Takes every second of your [ __ ] life.
[09:05] Anybody says balance? Yeah, balance is
[09:07] important for a lot of [ __ ] people.
[09:08] It is. But if you want to [ __ ] go to
[09:11] that edge where people do not like you,
[09:13] don't understand you, question
[09:14] everything you [ __ ] do, you you've
[09:16] arrived. You just can't read about it.
[09:20] You can't sit back and be a theorist.
[09:23] You have to be a [ __ ] practitioner.
[09:25] >> At the end of the day, I asked myself
[09:26] one question. Can I take one more step?
[09:30] And usually the answer is yes. So if you
[09:33] can answer that question and not take
[09:35] another step, that is real failure. That
[09:38] is real quitting. So a lot of people can
[09:41] take one more step, but they choose not
[09:43] to. I don't know if you can take two
[09:44] steps. You got to answer that question
[09:46] after you take the first step.
[09:49] But I can always take one more step. So
[09:51] if I choose not to, that's on me. And I
[09:53] got to live with that. Are you happy?
[09:55] What's wrong with you? I'm driven. I'm
[09:58] obsessed. And that's what you see.
[10:00] Failure is the ultimate thing, man. I
[10:02] failed so many times before. That's why
[10:04] I don't look at failure anymore as
[10:05] failure. I look as my first, second, and
[10:07] third attempt. How you going to feel,
[10:10] man, when you accomplish this goal
[10:12] coming from that [ __ ] coming from the
[10:15] [ __ ] hell you came from? A lot of
[10:17] people start from a good starting point.
[10:19] They have a good foundation. What if you
[10:21] can surpass all of these [ __ ]
[10:23] We have everybody who was [ __ ] way up
[10:25] here. Started up here and you had you
[10:29] started with no legs. You had to grow
[10:30] [ __ ] legs to even start walking and
[10:33] then crawling and then running and then
[10:35] you start passing people and all that's
[10:36] given to them. I had to use all this
[10:39] negative [ __ ] that was making me weak
[10:42] and horrible as a person. I had to use
[10:45] this as the power that now fueled me had
[10:48] to flip it on its head and say, "Hold
[10:49] up.
[10:51] This might be exactly what I need." For
[10:54] for me, I I made a decision and my
[10:56] decision was to be the best person I
[10:59] could. And I basically a lot of mornings
[11:03] I wake up and say, "Fuck your feelings."
[11:05] And that doesn't mean like, you know,
[11:08] don't take it literally, [ __ ] your
[11:09] feelings. But sometimes you have to go
[11:11] beyond what you're feeling. and my knees
[11:14] were [ __ ] But guess what? I wanted to
[11:15] run.
[11:16] >> I have to change cuz I I can't stay
[11:19] here. I can't I I looked at myself in
[11:21] the mirror and I was defeated. I go,
[11:23] "Look, look at myself." I'm like, "Who
[11:24] am I?" So, I know why you go on
[11:26] Instagram. I know why you cuz you just
[11:30] have the time. You have the time because
[11:34] you don't want to put that time into
[11:37] bettering oneself. I had two options. To
[11:40] either be that 300 lb guy who sprayed
[11:43] for cockroaches and made $1,000 a month
[11:46] and at 24 years old knowing when I'm 50
[11:49] [ __ ] years old, I can reflect on this
[11:51] and think about what guy I never became
[11:53] or I can totally just sack it up and
[11:56] fail and fail and fail until I succeed.
[12:00] Let me teach you the real life how it
[12:02] really is. The reason why you're a loser
[12:04] and the reason why you're not [ __ ]
[12:05] making it and the reason why you're
[12:07] trying to go to all these I go to all
[12:08] these [ __ ] conventions, speak all the
[12:10] [ __ ] time. I look in the [ __ ]
[12:12] audience and these people sign up, sign
[12:15] up, sign up [ __ ] every year to go to
[12:17] convention thinking they're going to
[12:19] learn something [ __ ] different. No,
[12:21] you're lazy. You know exactly what to
[12:24] do. Exactly what to do. Cuz even me in
[12:27] my state of I can't read and write, I
[12:30] knew exactly what to do.
[12:33] It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do
[12:37] it. It sucks to wake up every morning of
[12:39] your life and say, "God, man, I'm I'm
[12:42] not smart. So, guess what I got to do? I
[12:45] got to I got to study the same [ __ ] that
[12:47] I got one of the highest scores in the
[12:49] nation on and do it again. Do it again.
[12:53] Do it again. It's not just there. It's
[12:55] not just there permanently for me.
[12:57] You're alone. You're alone. You may have
[13:00] a shrink you're going to. You may have a
[13:01] best friend you're going to, but there's
[13:04] 24 hours in the day where you're alone
[13:06] in this brain. And your brain is talking
[13:09] to you in all kind of ways and it wants
[13:11] to control you and pull you in these
[13:12] different pockets. If you can't control
[13:15] your own brain and your brain controls
[13:17] you, you're [ __ ] You got to tell your
[13:20] brain where you want to go and how you
[13:21] want to go and how you want to get
[13:22] there. You got to control it. If not,
[13:25] it's over. But you're also the
[13:27] scientist.
[13:30] You create your own self. Most people
[13:33] are missing something because there's so
[13:34] much trapped in there. I don't I don't
[13:38] even want to say potential. I think
[13:39] that's word is used out too much too.
[13:41] There's so much in you that God or
[13:42] whoever the hell you believe in or if
[13:44] you're atheist in you that you have not
[13:47] un unlocked that you walk around with
[13:50] this gorgeous wife or great husband and
[13:52] all this money like god I feel like I'm
[13:54] missing something. Yeah. Because it's
[13:56] about 75% of you is still [ __ ] in
[14:00] there, still chained up because you just
[14:05] didn't want to find your willpower.
[14:07] Didn't want to find your soul, your
[14:08] will, your heart, your determination,
[14:10] your guts, your courage. Because I'm
[14:12] looking for that person like me. I sat
[14:15] down at a table and I said to myself,
[14:18] what are you willing to give up?
[14:20] Everything.
[14:22] And when people come to me with that
[14:24] kind of ma mindset, I can work with you.
[14:27] When you are willing to strip yourself
[14:29] down to nothing and give everything,
[14:33] that's who I want to work with because
[14:36] now I can mold you into exactly who you
[14:39] want to be. When you put these
[14:41] restrictions up, and that's why my first
[14:44] question is, how bad do you want this?
[14:47] If it's as bad as you want to live or
[14:50] breathe or sleep, whatever the hell it
[14:51] may be, I can work with you. So, you
[14:54] better figure out who the [ __ ] you are
[14:56] on this journey. And those few people
[14:59] who don't many people don't like you, so
[15:01] be it. But you first have to figure out
[15:03] you because a lot of people die with a
[15:06] lot of untapped potential because
[15:09] they're trying to be somebody that
[15:10] they're not.
[15:11] >> Yeah.
[15:12] >> So, I was able to figure out my own
[15:13] potential by figuring out me. The mind
[15:16] controls everything. So what I realized
[15:18] was that when I was growing up and I was
[15:20] 300 lbs and I got all fat and I got all
[15:22] insecure. I realized that my mind kept
[15:26] taking me in this direction when things
[15:28] got uncomfortable for me. When I was
[15:30] facing my insecurities, I was facing my
[15:32] fears. My mind said, "Oh no, we have the
[15:34] tactical advantage. We need to get you
[15:36] separate you from this feeling. This
[15:39] feeling over here. Life's all about
[15:40] feelings. We want the happy feeling. We
[15:43] don't want that feeling of this sucks.
[15:45] Why am I here? And you don't have any so
[15:48] so you can't answer those questions. So
[15:49] you leave. I started realizing that if
[15:52] in that moment, you can answer those
[15:55] [ __ ] up questions and you are now in
[15:59] charge of your brain versus your brain
[16:01] ruling you. That's where all that stuff
[16:03] comes from. So, so, so the 40% rule is
[16:06] all of that. You get to 40%, your brain
[16:08] says, "We're done. Let's roll. Man, this
[16:11] is starting to get painful. this is
[16:12] uncomfortable. So you sit down, you have
[16:15] to figure out ways and everybody's
[16:16] different. That's how the book kind of
[16:18] talks about like we all have these
[16:19] things about, you know, five steps to
[16:22] this and and four steps to this. It's
[16:24] it's a lot more than that. That's all
[16:26] [ __ ] It's it's a practice that you
[16:29] have to it's a habit. So if you know
[16:31] that at 40% I'm still, you know, I'm
[16:33] feeling pain. At 40% I'm feeling pain.
[16:36] That's where the 40% rule kicks in. Now
[16:38] it starts, okay, I'm I'm feeling pain.
[16:41] My mind's saying all this [ __ ] to me.
[16:43] It's saying, "Get out of here. Run.
[16:45] Flee." The fight or flight kicks in.
[16:47] Okay, we're done. We're not good enough.
[16:49] It starts telling you all these things.
[16:51] You start to believe it cuz the mind
[16:53] controls all. This is the time where you
[16:55] have to gain control back of your mind
[16:58] and say, "Okay, let me see if I can go
[17:00] 45%."
[17:01] And once you start giving yourself more
[17:03] and more hope and start realizing, okay,
[17:06] the mind starts to be, "Okay, what are
[17:08] you doing? We're supposed to be going
[17:10] right and you're going left. You start
[17:12] then controlling your mind. Start
[17:15] finding more in, you know, in yourself
[17:17] and it goes from 40% to a lot further
[17:19] than that. But that's the start of it
[17:20] though. Get to get to the spot where
[17:22] your mind is saying stop. Wherever that
[17:25] is. Got to get there first and then
[17:28] that's when that [ __ ] starts to work for
[17:29] you. Two heart surgeries, multiple knee
[17:32] surgeries, and after every knee surgery,
[17:34] they say I can run again. And I'm fine
[17:36] with that.
[17:38] There's no running up here, bro. None.
[17:41] This was what it was all about. That's
[17:43] what they lost. We can't run. Give a
[17:46] [ __ ]
[17:48] It was never about running. Why do you
[17:50] think I run? It's the worst thing. I I
[17:54] hate doing it more than anything.
[17:57] Hence the willpower, right? Your
[17:59] anterior mids singulate cortex would be
[18:01] would start to regress if you loved
[18:03] running. Think about it. Every day I
[18:06] wake up. I don't just run a mile, two
[18:09] miles. It's the one thing I hate the
[18:12] most to do. And I do it like I love it.
[18:17] 250, 60, 70, 300 mile runs at one time,
[18:22] no sleep. And every step when I get to,
[18:25] think about this. I get to the [ __ ]
[18:26] start line cussing at Jennifer.
[18:30] Why the [ __ ] am I here? I hate this
[18:32] [ __ ]
[18:33] >> What is your biggest fear?
[18:36] Why are you paralyzed? What What makes
[18:38] you nervous to just go out there and
[18:42] just be who you are and do what you have
[18:46] to do? You had nobody anyway,
[18:48] [ __ ] So, see how I'm talking
[18:50] right now? That's me.
[18:52] That [ __ ] fires me the [ __ ] up. That
[18:54] [ __ ] makes me [ __ ] nuts. You had
[18:56] nobody anyway, [ __ ] Look around
[18:58] you. There was no [ __ ] team. It was
[19:01] you. There was no weight loss program or
[19:05] mom and dad waking you up saying you can
[19:07] do it, you can be better, trying to
[19:09] build belief. You built belief when you
[19:11] had nothing.
[19:13] Rock bottom. We're not able to think.
[19:16] The the most powerful weapon in the
[19:19] world. We walk around with it. It's our
[19:22] mind. It's our brain. You have to be
[19:25] able to go into a very dark place in
[19:27] your mind
[19:29] and figure who you are. go back to what
[19:33] you want to do. What's your purpose? We
[19:35] can't figure our purpose out or why
[19:36] we're here or why we're even born or
[19:39] whatever because our it's so loud in our
[19:41] mind. We don't have any quiet time with
[19:43] ourselves to sit back and say, "What do
[19:45] I really want?" There's so many
[19:47] different dialogues in our head that we
[19:49] can't think. So, my biggest thing is you
[19:51] have to be alone in a very dark place in
[19:54] your mind to think about what is
[19:56] important to you. You can [ __ ]
[19:58] achieve the absolute impossible. You
[20:00] don't need great parents. You don't need
[20:02] like a private school. You don't need to
[20:04] have this humongous GPA and all this
[20:07] other [ __ ] What you need is the one
[20:09] thing I talk about in my book, which is
[20:11] straight up brutal work ethic. There's
[20:14] no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You
[20:18] against you. And if you misunderstand
[20:20] that, you have a real problem. Pretty
[20:23] soon you win. Pretty soon you'll [ __ ]
[20:26] win. If you have the courage and the
[20:28] heart and the dedication and the mindset
[20:29] about everybody can go [ __ ] themselves.
[20:32] I know what I know. I've listened to
[20:34] myself enough to know I know what I
[20:37] know. In the battle, in the battle, you
[20:40] find peace. When you go to war with
[20:42] yourself, you find a lot of peace
[20:45] because you know exactly who you are.
[20:47] And that is where the peace is really
[20:49] found for me. It's so easy to be great
[20:52] nowadays, my friend. Cuz most people are
[20:53] weak. Most people don't want to go to
[20:56] that extra mile. Most people don't want
[20:57] to find that extra because it sucks.
[21:00] Every day I walk this earth and I see
[21:02] average all over the [ __ ] place. Know
[21:04] that if you have big goals and big
[21:06] dreams along the way, failure is going
[21:10] to happen. So, how fast do you get up
[21:12] from that? And you got to teach yourself
[21:14] that it's time to get back to work. Stop
[21:18] hearing yourself talk. Get off the
[21:20] podcast. Don't be on social media too
[21:22] much. Cut out all the [ __ ] noise. Get
[21:24] back to the [ __ ] mental

## Plain Text (for processing)

But guess what happens? That alarm clock goes off at 4:00 a.m. to train. I don't want to be a seal today or I don't want to be whatever today. I'll start tomorrow. You hate me because you're probably in the bed right now. You're probably an underachiever. You're probably somebody who doesn't want to do anything with your life. So I make you question everything about yourself. One thing I did wrong in my life was I tried for so many years to please people and I did it at the expense of myself. I was leaving a lot in the tank and I and when you do that you stop living and you will live exactly the way you live now questioning who you are wondering what is possible wondering what you are capable of doing that's how that looks or you can be me which am I happy I don't know never thought about it don't really care about it cuz all I really cared about was I looked in that [ __ ] mirror I saw a piece of [ __ ] happiness wasn't on the mirror at around 300 lb. It wasn't like I'm looking for happiness. No, I'm looking at myself in the mirror and said, "All right, [ __ ] You did it again today." I had to stop thinking normal. I had to stop thinking normal. I can no longer be a common man walking around doing common things. But no one taught me this stuff. It wasn't like I had, you know, I paid a trainer to come train me. Jenny Craig didn't come down and miracle my ass. None of this happened. It was on me. I became obsessed. I became obsessed with being the baddest [ __ ] that God ever created. Am I that? I don't care. I believe it. And I was trying to tell him, once you become obsessed with something, obsessed. It's okay to be unbalanced for a while. It's okay. Don't be all this stuff people say, you got to be balanced. To be the best in the world at what you do. It's not about being a Navy Seal, people. The best at what you do. You have to be on balance to find every bit of [ __ ] energy and strength that you have to pull it off. I don't look at anything as failure because when you're willing to try to do something, not trying is failure. That's that's and that's not some after school special [ __ ] but when you're able to go out there, there there is no failure. It's attempts. Cuz when you're trying to do something that's bigger than you, whatever you are, whoever you are, if if if you're paralyzed, you're trying to walk one step and you didn't. You didn't fail, [ __ ] That was your first attempt. >> If that's your biggest thing, that's how your mindset needs to go into everything. So, I don't look at it as failure is a big word like that gets people down and [ __ ] We give so much power to words. I don't no one's going to miracle me to be somebody special. Everybody that call me [ __ ] my dad, my mom, all my situations were on me now and solely on me. In 2013, people wanted me to write my book. I did it in 2018. Took five years. And the reason why I didn't do it, I sat at the table and Jennifer was there. This before I I I she started working for me. I started dating or whatever. And all these people are there. And they're like, "Man, you got to go on social media." And I was like, "Fuck you, man. Like, I'm not that's it's it's poison. It's poison." Because I knew what I did to get where I am. And I'm going to have these people, these normal everyday people, fat, lazy, in exactly who I was judging me cuz I know it cuz I was once them. Failure is the ultimate thing, man. I failed so many times before. That's why I don't look at failure anymore as failure. I look as my first, second, and third attempt to be at the point of your life where you don't care about being judged. You can be in a room of a million people and they all hate you and you walk in and you go like this because not because you're angry at them, because you know yourself inside and out and you know that you've put yourself through hell to be where you're at today. You've walked the walk. You've talked the talk and you've walked the walk. And that's to me what it's all about. You have to make the decision whether you want to be a badass or whether you want just want to be mediocre and everything's okay. A good painter will not just paint. He needs to create. And you can't create with phones and everything going around you. So, you got to block yourself off. You only do two podcasts in a year. You block yourself off and you're and you're painting this thing inside and you're going through all these different colors of paint and everything else and you can only figure out the right painting if you spend the correct amount of time in your brain. You have to face that in that dark room. In that dark room is who you are. >> But in that dark room is where you have to create another human being that walks out of that dark room to face who you are. That's the only way you're going to get over all those things. So, basically, a lot of us aren't prepared for life. We get up willy-nilly and just hope life is going to happen. It is going to happen, but it's going to happen with a prepared mind or an unprepared mind. Most people attack life with the unprepared mind. What I do is I try to account for all things that could happen, might happen, probably will happen, and then the unknowns. Whenever you think you can't, the confidence comes from the thing that you built. You must build belief. You must build confidence. It can't be like, "Hey, um, I'm going to go knock that [ __ ] out." You got to look over here and say, "I can knock that [ __ ] out." It's a belief and it's built on what you put in to yourself. I had to miserably wake up every morning in the cold cuz it was Indiana, November when it started. I was miserable. This is your new life. Take it or leave it. There's no happiness about it. There's no peace behind it. It sucks. You got to live with that. I live with it for a lot of years. And so I sat back and said, "Okay, all right. I know what this takes." And when you sit back, >> as [ __ ] up as I was, and I had a laundry list, a a table like this of what I have to do to become just a human being. I understand that guy. I understand exactly where you're coming from. That is your personal opinion and I totally get that. But there's very few people in this world who want to do a job like that. And it takes a different kind of mindset. Is it tear grass appropriate? I don't know. How hard that training is, I don't expect anybody to understand it but 1%. But the loud voices of this world are the 99% who don't understand exactly what you have to do. I was I became the most obsessed person on the planet earth. And I was basically I had to invent a guy that didn't exist. I lived a life so disciplined that everybody that I once looked to these fake characters, I I I built that as a man. And when I was younger, I had this image in my mind of what does a man look like to me? And I got all these people who were badasses characters. And in my mind, I became that. I don't quit. You know, I may not make it the first time, >> but I'll come back. I got to call audible. I got to [ __ ] I got to I got to [ __ ] get my head back in the game. I got to I got to figure this [ __ ] out. It doesn't mean you leave. It means you study it more. When do you rest? >> When do you recover? >> Yeah. And I don't want to scare people, but the truth answer is I don't take any days off that I turned a person this [ __ ] up into this [ __ ] right here. Not off of reading a [ __ ] book off a theorist, off of going to work on myself and saying, "I don't know how to do this." But I know that to get over there to that [ __ ] side, I got to grind myself into a [ __ ] fine powder. And I did it. If you want to be great, you want to be badass [ __ ] ever at what you do, you're going to be misunderstood by everybody because you're going to be so [ __ ] obsessed and so driven to get there. And that's what it takes. >> That's the truth. >> Takes every second of your [ __ ] life. Anybody says balance? Yeah, balance is important for a lot of [ __ ] people. It is. But if you want to [ __ ] go to that edge where people do not like you, don't understand you, question everything you [ __ ] do, you you've arrived. You just can't read about it. You can't sit back and be a theorist. You have to be a [ __ ] practitioner. >> At the end of the day, I asked myself one question. Can I take one more step? And usually the answer is yes. So if you can answer that question and not take another step, that is real failure. That is real quitting. So a lot of people can take one more step, but they choose not to. I don't know if you can take two steps. You got to answer that question after you take the first step. But I can always take one more step. So if I choose not to, that's on me. And I got to live with that. Are you happy? What's wrong with you? I'm driven. I'm obsessed. And that's what you see. Failure is the ultimate thing, man. I failed so many times before. That's why I don't look at failure anymore as failure. I look as my first, second, and third attempt. How you going to feel, man, when you accomplish this goal coming from that [ __ ] coming from the [ __ ] hell you came from? A lot of people start from a good starting point. They have a good foundation. What if you can surpass all of these [ __ ] We have everybody who was [ __ ] way up here. Started up here and you had you started with no legs. You had to grow [ __ ] legs to even start walking and then crawling and then running and then you start passing people and all that's given to them. I had to use all this negative [ __ ] that was making me weak and horrible as a person. I had to use this as the power that now fueled me had to flip it on its head and say, "Hold up. This might be exactly what I need." For for me, I I made a decision and my decision was to be the best person I could. And I basically a lot of mornings I wake up and say, "Fuck your feelings." And that doesn't mean like, you know, don't take it literally, [ __ ] your feelings. But sometimes you have to go beyond what you're feeling. and my knees were [ __ ] But guess what? I wanted to run. >> I have to change cuz I I can't stay here. I can't I I looked at myself in the mirror and I was defeated. I go, "Look, look at myself." I'm like, "Who am I?" So, I know why you go on Instagram. I know why you cuz you just have the time. You have the time because you don't want to put that time into bettering oneself. I had two options. To either be that 300 lb guy who sprayed for cockroaches and made $1,000 a month and at 24 years old knowing when I'm 50 [ __ ] years old, I can reflect on this and think about what guy I never became or I can totally just sack it up and fail and fail and fail until I succeed. Let me teach you the real life how it really is. The reason why you're a loser and the reason why you're not [ __ ] making it and the reason why you're trying to go to all these I go to all these [ __ ] conventions, speak all the [ __ ] time. I look in the [ __ ] audience and these people sign up, sign up, sign up [ __ ] every year to go to convention thinking they're going to learn something [ __ ] different. No, you're lazy. You know exactly what to do. Exactly what to do. Cuz even me in my state of I can't read and write, I knew exactly what to do. It just sucks doing it. It sucks to do it. It sucks to wake up every morning of your life and say, "God, man, I'm I'm not smart. So, guess what I got to do? I got to I got to study the same [ __ ] that I got one of the highest scores in the nation on and do it again. Do it again. Do it again. It's not just there. It's not just there permanently for me. You're alone. You're alone. You may have a shrink you're going to. You may have a best friend you're going to, but there's 24 hours in the day where you're alone in this brain. And your brain is talking to you in all kind of ways and it wants to control you and pull you in these different pockets. If you can't control your own brain and your brain controls you, you're [ __ ] You got to tell your brain where you want to go and how you want to go and how you want to get there. You got to control it. If not, it's over. But you're also the scientist. You create your own self. Most people are missing something because there's so much trapped in there. I don't I don't even want to say potential. I think that's word is used out too much too. There's so much in you that God or whoever the hell you believe in or if you're atheist in you that you have not un unlocked that you walk around with this gorgeous wife or great husband and all this money like god I feel like I'm missing something. Yeah. Because it's about 75% of you is still [ __ ] in there, still chained up because you just didn't want to find your willpower. Didn't want to find your soul, your will, your heart, your determination, your guts, your courage. Because I'm looking for that person like me. I sat down at a table and I said to myself, what are you willing to give up? Everything. And when people come to me with that kind of ma mindset, I can work with you. When you are willing to strip yourself down to nothing and give everything, that's who I want to work with because now I can mold you into exactly who you want to be. When you put these restrictions up, and that's why my first question is, how bad do you want this? If it's as bad as you want to live or breathe or sleep, whatever the hell it may be, I can work with you. So, you better figure out who the [ __ ] you are on this journey. And those few people who don't many people don't like you, so be it. But you first have to figure out you because a lot of people die with a lot of untapped potential because they're trying to be somebody that they're not. >> Yeah. >> So, I was able to figure out my own potential by figuring out me. The mind controls everything. So what I realized was that when I was growing up and I was 300 lbs and I got all fat and I got all insecure. I realized that my mind kept taking me in this direction when things got uncomfortable for me. When I was facing my insecurities, I was facing my fears. My mind said, "Oh no, we have the tactical advantage. We need to get you separate you from this feeling. This feeling over here. Life's all about feelings. We want the happy feeling. We don't want that feeling of this sucks. Why am I here? And you don't have any so so you can't answer those questions. So you leave. I started realizing that if in that moment, you can answer those [ __ ] up questions and you are now in charge of your brain versus your brain ruling you. That's where all that stuff comes from. So, so, so the 40% rule is all of that. You get to 40%, your brain says, "We're done. Let's roll. Man, this is starting to get painful. this is uncomfortable. So you sit down, you have to figure out ways and everybody's different. That's how the book kind of talks about like we all have these things about, you know, five steps to this and and four steps to this. It's it's a lot more than that. That's all [ __ ] It's it's a practice that you have to it's a habit. So if you know that at 40% I'm still, you know, I'm feeling pain. At 40% I'm feeling pain. That's where the 40% rule kicks in. Now it starts, okay, I'm I'm feeling pain. My mind's saying all this [ __ ] to me. It's saying, "Get out of here. Run. Flee." The fight or flight kicks in. Okay, we're done. We're not good enough. It starts telling you all these things. You start to believe it cuz the mind controls all. This is the time where you have to gain control back of your mind and say, "Okay, let me see if I can go 45%." And once you start giving yourself more and more hope and start realizing, okay, the mind starts to be, "Okay, what are you doing? We're supposed to be going right and you're going left. You start then controlling your mind. Start finding more in, you know, in yourself and it goes from 40% to a lot further than that. But that's the start of it though. Get to get to the spot where your mind is saying stop. Wherever that is. Got to get there first and then that's when that [ __ ] starts to work for you. Two heart surgeries, multiple knee surgeries, and after every knee surgery, they say I can run again. And I'm fine with that. There's no running up here, bro. None. This was what it was all about. That's what they lost. We can't run. Give a [ __ ] It was never about running. Why do you think I run? It's the worst thing. I I hate doing it more than anything. Hence the willpower, right? Your anterior mids singulate cortex would be would start to regress if you loved running. Think about it. Every day I wake up. I don't just run a mile, two miles. It's the one thing I hate the most to do. And I do it like I love it. 250, 60, 70, 300 mile runs at one time, no sleep. And every step when I get to, think about this. I get to the [ __ ] start line cussing at Jennifer. Why the [ __ ] am I here? I hate this [ __ ] >> What is your biggest fear? Why are you paralyzed? What What makes you nervous to just go out there and just be who you are and do what you have to do? You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] So, see how I'm talking right now? That's me. That [ __ ] fires me the [ __ ] up. That [ __ ] makes me [ __ ] nuts. You had nobody anyway, [ __ ] Look around you. There was no [ __ ] team. It was you. There was no weight loss program or mom and dad waking you up saying you can do it, you can be better, trying to build belief. You built belief when you had nothing. Rock bottom. We're not able to think. The the most powerful weapon in the world. We walk around with it. It's our mind. It's our brain. You have to be able to go into a very dark place in your mind and figure who you are. go back to what you want to do. What's your purpose? We can't figure our purpose out or why we're here or why we're even born or whatever because our it's so loud in our mind. We don't have any quiet time with ourselves to sit back and say, "What do I really want?" There's so many different dialogues in our head that we can't think. So, my biggest thing is you have to be alone in a very dark place in your mind to think about what is important to you. You can [ __ ] achieve the absolute impossible. You don't need great parents. You don't need like a private school. You don't need to have this humongous GPA and all this other [ __ ] What you need is the one thing I talk about in my book, which is straight up brutal work ethic. There's no hacks, bro. It's you against you. You against you. And if you misunderstand that, you have a real problem. Pretty soon you win. Pretty soon you'll [ __ ] win. If you have the courage and the heart and the dedication and the mindset about everybody can go [ __ ] themselves. I know what I know. I've listened to myself enough to know I know what I know. In the battle, in the battle, you find peace. When you go to war with yourself, you find a lot of peace because you know exactly who you are. And that is where the peace is really found for me. It's so easy to be great nowadays, my friend. Cuz most people are weak. Most people don't want to go to that extra mile. Most people don't want to find that extra because it sucks. Every day I walk this earth and I see average all over the [ __ ] place. Know that if you have big goals and big dreams along the way, failure is going to happen. So, how fast do you get up from that? And you got to teach yourself that it's time to get back to work. Stop hearing yourself talk. Get off the podcast. Don't be on social media too much. Cut out all the [ __ ] noise. Get back to the [ __ ] mental
