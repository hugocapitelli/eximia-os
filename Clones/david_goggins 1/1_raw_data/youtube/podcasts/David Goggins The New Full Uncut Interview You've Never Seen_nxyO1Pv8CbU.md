## Full Transcript

[00:11] [Applause]
[00:24] Thank you.
[00:28] >> All right.
[00:33] Who's going to carry the boats?
[00:35] [Applause]
[00:40] >> All right. So, do you know why I demand
[00:44] that? Not for me. When I come out to
[00:47] every single audience, which you guys
[00:48] are one of the best ever.
[00:51] [Applause]
[00:54] The reason why I demand that from the
[00:56] audience is because I know what darkness
[01:00] looks like.
[01:02] >> I know what it feels like to be alone
[01:05] with no motivation, no drive, no
[01:08] passion.
[01:10] And what has to come out of your [ __ ]
[01:13] soul in the darkest of times is what you
[01:17] just did right there.
[01:20] So that's what I do.
[01:23] So people always like for the first
[01:25] 20ome years of my life it was just
[01:27] darkness. But if you are able to get up
[01:30] every morning have no passion, no drive,
[01:34] no motivation, no [ __ ] and still get up
[01:38] with that kind of fire. You will be
[01:40] successful in life. I guarantee you
[01:42] that.
[01:48] >> That was okay.
[01:49] >> That was okay.
[01:50] >> It was okay. It wasn't great, but it was
[01:51] okay. One of the best is not the best,
[01:54] but we trying. I know. I know. All
[01:57] right. Well, first of all, thank you.
[01:59] Thanks for being here. Thanks for being
[02:01] who you are. Seriously. And thanks for
[02:03] just being straight. No [ __ ]
[02:05] >> Appreciate it.
[02:05] >> Because, and I was saying this, Dave,
[02:07] backstage. We've been doing this
[02:08] together for 10 years now. Some of you
[02:09] been here for 10 days. So, you've been
[02:11] here for three years, 10 years. And I've
[02:13] probably in 10 years said, "This book
[02:16] changed my life." Not many. I'll be
[02:18] honest with you. Um, the only one I read
[02:20] every day is the Bible and I read but
[02:22] but I if you've not read and I'll read
[02:25] them all now and I ain't bullshitting
[02:27] either because when I started reading it
[02:30] hurt me
[02:32] it honestly it really it really really
[02:34] screwed me up because I started feeling
[02:39] the pain
[02:40] >> right
[02:40] >> and it was like it was hurting me more
[02:43] because the whole title is it can't hurt
[02:45] me. We have all these amazing people out
[02:47] here, dude. And they're they're they're
[02:49] great human beings,
[02:52] but it is whatever it is in their life
[02:54] is hurting them. Whatever it happens to
[02:56] be, they eat what they kill here. That's
[03:00] it. Everybody you see out here,
[03:01] commission based sales. Every one of
[03:03] them. You seen a bunch up on stage
[03:04] killing it. They're great. But there's
[03:06] some right now, David, that are trying
[03:08] to figure out what to do tomorrow, next
[03:09] week, month. There's people out here
[03:11] right now. They ain't going to raise
[03:12] their hands because you're here. They're
[03:13] excited, but they're thinking about
[03:14] quitting. they're thinking about it.
[03:17] What would you say to just about that
[03:20] mindset and what it takes to do what
[03:23] we're doing? Because the pain is what I
[03:25] hear about, man. And you you you ain't
[03:27] nobody talks about that better than you.
[03:30] >> Well, the f Well, first of all, what you
[03:31] guys got to understand, guys and gals
[03:33] understand is that I keep it real. I'm
[03:36] not super human. I'm definitely not
[03:38] Superman. So when I talk to you all,
[03:42] understand these are the things that I
[03:45] had to tell myself. So you know, a lot
[03:48] of people come up here and start talking
[03:49] to you and they think they have all the
[03:50] damn answers and [ __ ] and they kind of
[03:52] talk down on people. No, no, no. I know
[03:55] exactly what it feels like to be lost,
[03:58] to want to quit every day of your life.
[04:00] And that's kind of what created me. So
[04:03] on my bad days,
[04:05] that's where all this taking souls and
[04:07] [ __ ] comes from. So on my bad days, I
[04:11] had to imagine a false reality. So for
[04:15] me, for instance, I was 300 pounds. A
[04:16] lot of you guys know my backstory.
[04:19] And a black kid there. I was the only 36
[04:22] Africanamean Navy Seal in over 80 years.
[04:27] So think about this though. Think about
[04:29] how I wanted to quit. I was afraid of
[04:32] the water.
[04:34] My favorite meal was chocolate
[04:36] milkshakes with chocolate donuts.
[04:40] I didn't run and I was afraid of the
[04:43] water and I was 300 lb. And I have a
[04:47] pipe dream of going to go be a Navy
[04:49] Seal.
[04:51] Yeah, exactly. You should be laughing.
[04:54] Every morning I woke up and I had less
[04:57] than three months to lose 106 pounds to
[05:00] get into the Navy.
[05:02] Every morning I woke up, I wanted to
[05:04] quit.
[05:06] During runs, I quit. During my diet, I
[05:09] quit during swims. I quit. I quit every
[05:14] single day during this two and a half
[05:16] month.
[05:18] But the end of the day, what kept me
[05:20] going was I saw a video of 18 men
[05:25] graduating from Navy Seals training.
[05:29] And all I thought about was,
[05:32] what if
[05:33] what if my black ass can be up there on
[05:38] that [ __ ] stage one day and I can
[05:41] pull off this [ __ ] miracle that no
[05:44] one saw. There were no [ __ ] social
[05:45] media. There were no watch David
[05:48] Gogggins lose 106 pounds in two and a
[05:50] half months. There was no, you know,
[05:54] diet plan and [ __ ] I No, there was
[05:56] nothing. No one saw it. My mom, she's
[05:59] here in the audience right now.
[06:01] [Applause]
[06:01] [Music]
[06:04] She saw it and she's the only one that
[06:08] saw the transformation.
[06:10] But I knew it. I saw it. The whole
[06:14] accountability mirror that I talk about
[06:16] and can't hurt me. Every morning I woke
[06:19] up, I had a real conversation with that
[06:22] dirty mirror. And every day the same
[06:25] answer came back to me. Do you want to
[06:28] be on your deathbed knowing that you
[06:31] could, but you didn't?
[06:34] And so every day I kept saying that. I
[06:37] kept saying that. And before I knew it,
[06:40] two and a half months later, I lost the
[06:42] weight and I was going to Navy steel
[06:44] training.
[06:45] [Applause]
[06:47] >> So,
[06:48] which
[06:50] it sounds so [ __ ] crazy that you're
[06:53] afraid of water.
[06:54] >> Terrified.
[06:55] >> Terrified of water. and decided, [ __ ]
[06:56] it, I'm going to join the Seals. That's
[06:58] a good idea. The the guy you talked
[07:01] about in your book, right? Because you
[07:02] were trying to figure out what to do.
[07:04] You had that whole like medical issue,
[07:06] right? And then you went back. What did
[07:08] that guy see in you? What did cuz that
[07:11] guy, right, that one was the one like
[07:12] here's what you got to do. Here's like
[07:13] he didn't he he saw something. What did
[07:15] he see in you at that time that you
[07:17] didn't see?
[07:18] >> I don't know if he saw anything.
[07:19] >> Okay.
[07:21] >> Basically, what he was doing for me was
[07:22] doing his job.
[07:24] >> Got it. no one else. So, when I walked
[07:26] up to every recruiter, and there was a
[07:28] lot of them, and I would always go back
[07:30] to my mom's house like upset, but every
[07:32] recruiter saw what they saw. And that's
[07:34] the thing you guys got to get from me
[07:36] right now. A lot of people see what they
[07:38] see. Maybe you're out of shape. Maybe
[07:40] you look lazy, maybe look slovenly,
[07:43] maybe the maybe your outward appearance
[07:45] is not what it should be. No one saw
[07:49] what was inside of me.
[07:52] And that's the one thing I was afraid to
[07:55] pull this out because who I was, I was
[07:58] afraid kid, but something always said,
[08:00] "Man, you got more in you." And what
[08:02] this guy did was just did his job.
[08:04] >> He looked at me. I said, "I want to be a
[08:06] SEAL." He goes, "You got to do this,
[08:08] this, this, and this." Every other
[08:10] recruiter was like, "You're 300 [ __ ]
[08:13] pounds, bro.
[08:15] Like, you walking into my office with a
[08:17] chocolate milkshake."
[08:20] So, I don't blame them because what they
[08:22] saw, I would have said the same [ __ ]
[08:24] But this one recruiter, Stephen Saljo, I
[08:28] walked in, he goes, "I'm going to do my
[08:31] job. I don't think this kid's going to
[08:33] make it. There's no way, but I'm going
[08:35] to do my job." And just by him giving me
[08:38] an opportunity,
[08:40] I gave the guy a lot of money a couple
[08:43] years ago. And he's like, "What? What's
[08:45] this for? This is like literally 20ome
[08:48] years ago. I find Steve and Salio again
[08:51] and I gave him money. He goes, "What the
[08:53] hell you give me money for?" I go,
[08:55] "Because you did your [ __ ] job."
[08:58] And if you didn't do your job, I would
[09:01] never have found David Gogggins.
[09:03] >> Wow.
[09:04] >> So, I gave him a [ __ ] check for doing
[09:06] his [ __ ] job.
[09:08] >> Damn.
[09:08] >> And that's all he did.
[09:11] >> Well, I I got to be honest with you,
[09:13] David, before you got here. And by the
[09:14] way, your mom's amazing, but she's like
[09:16] watching you. You're in the room. You're
[09:19] like, they watching mother effing
[09:20] everything that's going on. She looking
[09:22] over here. I look at David. She looking
[09:24] at David. I'm like, hell, if this goes
[09:26] bad, I don't stand a damn chance. She
[09:28] >> She's got some essay, man.
[09:29] >> Yo,
[09:30] >> she's got some essay
[09:31] >> for real. So, my man brought in he had a
[09:35] And this it gets to a question. It's
[09:36] real important from accountability
[09:37] standpoint. So, my man brought in a a a
[09:40] plate of cookies, 15 sugar cookies. And
[09:43] I looked I didn't say nothing. He said,
[09:45] "Oh [ __ ] I got to get rid of the
[09:46] cookies, right? David's coming. So, he
[09:48] got rid of the cookies. And I said,
[09:50] >> "Dude, why are you more worried about
[09:52] David seeing the cookies than you eating
[09:54] the cookies,
[09:55] >> right?"
[09:55] >> Like, what's you probably ain't going to
[09:57] see David again after today except for
[09:59] on YouTube. Like, what's he going to do
[10:01] to you?
[10:02] >> How do people cuz that happens to you.
[10:04] It's got to people around you like,
[10:05] "Dude, I was just I thought I was
[10:07] supposed to start warming up." He went
[10:09] back. He about nine miles back there. I
[10:11] said, "Where'd he go?" He goes, "Keeps
[10:13] walking around." He stood still. Not at
[10:14] all. And I'm I'm walking around. I don't
[10:16] even know why I'm walking around cuz I
[10:17] feel bad about myself.
[10:20] How do we get people to be more
[10:22] accountable to themselves than they are
[10:24] everybody else who actually doesn't even
[10:26] matter? They're not even a stakeholder
[10:27] in their life. That was the one thing
[10:30] that I was trapped in. So, a lot of
[10:32] people don't know this story about me,
[10:34] but when I was coming up, so I went to
[10:37] all white school for a while and then I
[10:40] went to a majority black school for a
[10:42] short period of time. And I went to
[10:45] majority black school. See, I always
[10:46] wanted to be after, so I wanted to be a
[10:49] priest first. No one knows that. And
[10:52] then after that, I'm like, I want to go
[10:55] be in special operations.
[10:57] Like I said, there's only 36
[10:59] African-Americans. So, you don't walk
[11:01] around a black community talking about,
[11:02] I want to go be in special operations.
[11:05] So,
[11:07] I tried to fit in.
[11:10] And by me trying to fit in with every
[11:12] group I was in, I lost myself.
[11:17] And so why I'm so polarizing now is
[11:21] because either you [ __ ] like me or
[11:26] you [ __ ] don't.
[11:29] And
[11:31] the reason why I was walking so much
[11:33] backstage,
[11:35] I'm nervous as [ __ ] to be out here in
[11:37] front of these people.
[11:39] Yeah. For real.
[11:41] >> My mom would tell you a story. When I
[11:44] was in elementary school, we moved from
[11:46] my dad's place where I got my ass beat.
[11:48] I had a lot of toxic stress.
[11:51] Hair was falling out of my head. I had a
[11:54] bunch of white splotches. And the
[11:55] biggest thing was I stuttered like a
[11:58] [ __ ]
[12:00] >> Bad. It's funny now. This [ __ ] wasn't
[12:03] funny when you were a [ __ ] kid.
[12:06] So,
[12:08] every time I get on stage, I think about
[12:10] one thing. We had a Christmas play and I
[12:14] was in
[12:17] maybe
[12:18] second, third grade, whatever it was.
[12:20] Didn't matter. I was young, but I
[12:22] stuttered horribly bad.
[12:25] And I'll never forget, the teacher gave
[12:27] me the smallest line possible because
[12:30] she knew this could be a [ __ ] train
[12:32] wreck. He may get up there and just act
[12:34] a fool.
[12:36] So, I got up there and I acted a fool
[12:38] and I just walked off [ __ ] stage. I
[12:41] couldn't say the I couldn't say [ __ ] I
[12:43] just went up there and just started just
[12:45] doing my [ __ ] Just started break
[12:46] dancing at the mouth.
[12:50] So, I walk off and every time I get on
[12:54] stage, I have to overcome
[12:58] that one feeling of looking out the
[13:00] audience and everybody and saying, "Oh
[13:03] shit." cuz I didn't cuss when I said in
[13:06] my mind there was no cuss words up there
[13:08] but I says so what happens is you have
[13:10] to gain this confidence because you lose
[13:13] yourself because you're always trying to
[13:15] hide from the stuttering or you're
[13:17] trying to hide from I wasn't that smart
[13:19] so I hid there I hid because I was only
[13:21] black person I hid because I wanted to
[13:23] be espec I was constantly hiding from
[13:27] these groups of people because I wanted
[13:29] to be accepted
[13:31] and the more I hid the more David Gagans
[13:34] became nothing. There was no David
[13:36] Gogggins. I was you when I was around
[13:39] you. I was Mary around Mary. I was John
[13:43] around John. There was no David
[13:45] Gogggins. And along this journey when I
[13:48] started losing weight and I had so many
[13:51] bad days in my life, so many bad days
[13:54] from growing up even now.
[13:58] Well, nobody [ __ ] there but David
[14:00] Gogggins.
[14:02] God was there,
[14:04] >> but God said, "Hey, [ __ ] I'm
[14:06] testing you today and I'm gonna test you
[14:08] tomorrow. I'm gonna test you again. I'm
[14:10] gonna let you I'm gonna let you alone,
[14:12] man. Pray all the [ __ ] you want.
[14:16] Pray. Get on your knees, boy. Pray.
[14:20] I'm going still kick your ass."
[14:23] >> So, the more I realized this is my
[14:25] journey and the more I realized where's
[14:28] all my friends?
[14:30] They ain't [ __ ] nowhere around. It
[14:33] was you. So, you better figure out who
[14:34] the [ __ ] you are on this journey. And
[14:38] those few people who don't many people
[14:39] don't like you, so be it. But you first
[14:42] have to figure out you because a lot of
[14:44] people die with a lot of untapped
[14:47] potential because they're trying to be
[14:50] somebody that they're not.
[14:51] >> Yeah.
[14:52] >> So, I was able to figure out my own
[14:53] potential by figuring out me.
[14:57] Dude, I was really prepared for you to
[15:00] be hardcore as [ __ ] but you're [ __ ]
[15:02] funny. Like really funny. I didn't know
[15:05] that. Like really funny.
[15:08] And I want to get to because I was
[15:09] watching something you posted the other
[15:10] day which I think was great because what
[15:11] a lot of the men and women in here are
[15:13] work with David is, you know, we call
[15:15] people up and sell them life insurance.
[15:16] And most of the people tend to get a
[15:18] pretty good grasp on that, right?
[15:19] Everybody's going to die. You need life
[15:20] insurance. You asked for it. Most people
[15:22] get pretty good grasp on that and and
[15:23] are able to monetize it, make a living,
[15:25] and then they have a choice to build a
[15:26] business and actually help other people.
[15:28] And I actually didn't start hiring
[15:29] people because I thought about spread. I
[15:31] had friends that had no job. They're
[15:33] broke. And I'm like, "Yo, you should do
[15:34] this." They're like, "Why?" I'm like,
[15:35] "It's easy." Like, that was how I
[15:36] started building a business. But a lot
[15:38] of the men and women we have here are
[15:39] paralyzed. They want to talk about it.
[15:41] They want to post. They want to talk to
[15:43] their friends, their family. They want
[15:44] to post something on social media, but
[15:46] they're truly terrified. If we could
[15:48] polygraph everybody in here, 80% of them
[15:50] would blow up. when we said, "Are you
[15:51] worried about what people think if you
[15:52] post and try to recruit?" And you'd post
[15:54] something recently about how many people
[15:56] don't even follow you. Like, I didn't
[15:57] know that [ __ ] Like, they don't even
[15:58] follow you, but they go on to comment.
[16:00] Like, they don't follow you.
[16:01] >> 23 million nonfollowers.
[16:04] >> 23 million people go on to talk [ __ ]
[16:06] Don't even follow you. They won't follow
[16:08] you. They don't want to see your
[16:09] content, but then they seek it out, see
[16:10] it, and then talk about it. How do you
[16:13] help everybody here truly? Because I
[16:16] suck it a lot, but I'm like a lot. And
[16:18] I'm like, dude, I really just don't care
[16:20] what anybody thinks at all. Like, if I
[16:22] come up here and do this interview and
[16:24] and and they're like, "That was
[16:25] terrible." If you're like, "Dude, that
[16:26] was awful." I'm like, "Dude, I gave it
[16:27] everything I got." Like, I'm I did the
[16:29] best I could and try to screw it up and
[16:31] give me feedback. I'll get better. How
[16:33] do we empower everybody in here? How do
[16:35] you empower everybody in here to just
[16:37] truly proceed, do whatever the hell they
[16:39] want with their business, ask everybody
[16:42] they run into, there's hundreds of
[16:44] millions of people in America. We do.
[16:46] We're we're we're for our business.
[16:47] We're a good big company, right? But
[16:49] none of that matters. We could be 10
[16:50] times the size and still have too many
[16:53] people out there with no life insurance.
[16:54] How do we get these men and women to
[16:56] recruit people and not give a [ __ ] what
[16:57] anybody thinks or says about them? So, I
[17:00] have a question for you all, but only
[17:02] one person can answer it.
[17:06] What is your biggest fear?
[17:09] Why are you paralyzed? What what makes
[17:11] you nervous to just go out there and
[17:15] just be who you are and do what you have
[17:18] to do? I want to see one hand raise up
[17:21] to answer this question. You in the
[17:23] front, what is it?
[17:26] >> Past experience.
[17:27] >> So what? So failures. Okay, that's the
[17:30] perfect answer. And we did not set this
[17:32] up.
[17:34] So everybody asked me how the hell did I
[17:37] become successful when abused mindset,
[17:40] toxic stress, couldn't read and write,
[17:44] fat,
[17:45] name it, sickle cell. I I can't even be
[17:48] in the military nowadays with cickle
[17:50] cell. How the hell did I become
[17:53] successful when I had no passion, no
[17:56] drive, no nothing? And I'm going answer
[17:59] your question about what are you afraid
[18:01] of, right?
[18:04] You thought and you said failure.
[18:06] Everybody's afraid of failure. It's
[18:08] embarrassing as [ __ ] So how do you
[18:10] think I became successful when I failed
[18:12] every day of my life until I succeeded,
[18:16] which took a long time?
[18:19] The first thing I did was I All of you
[18:20] in this room want to be successful as
[18:23] hell. But the journey to success comes
[18:26] with a lot of what?
[18:29] >> Failure.
[18:30] So why the [ __ ] don't you teach yourself
[18:33] like I taught myself
[18:35] is how to fail
[18:38] properly.
[18:40] It's not saying be a failure. When I was
[18:43] 300 lb people think, oh, you really
[18:45] thought you could be a Navy Seal? No. I
[18:49] think I was going to [ __ ] lose the
[18:50] weight. But what it was was how I was
[18:53] able to get over all the failure and all
[18:56] the embarrassment of failing was I told
[18:59] myself,
[19:00] you are going to have to learn how to
[19:02] get up extremely fast because you are
[19:05] going to have a million setbacks on this
[19:07] journey. And that's how I literally
[19:11] taught myself how to fail first. Because
[19:14] I knew that if I was afraid of failure,
[19:17] I would have never been able to be a
[19:19] Navy Seal. I would have never been able
[19:21] to get to where I'm at today. So, I went
[19:24] through and I literally at 300 lbs or
[19:26] 297 to be exact. I sat back and I
[19:30] visualized how this journey is going to
[19:33] look in the first several months was
[19:37] nothing but failure. So, how am I going
[19:40] to get up the next morning when I failed
[19:43] the day before? How am I gonna eat this
[19:46] meal when I failed and I got fries and a
[19:49] milkshake again when I was supposed to
[19:52] get grilled chicken and rice? So, I went
[19:55] through and I taught myself how to fail.
[19:58] And when you do that, you're able to get
[20:01] up extremely fast and you no longer care
[20:05] about the end result because you know if
[20:08] I want to be way up here, it's going to
[20:11] take a bunch of small micro failures
[20:14] along the way. But you have to
[20:16] understand that that is part of the
[20:18] process. When you want to achieve the
[20:21] highest goal of all time,
[20:23] you are going to have to learn how to
[20:25] get your ass kicked all the way up that
[20:28] damn mountain. And then when you get up
[20:30] the mountain, the oxygen up there is
[20:33] very thin. It's hard to breathe. So it's
[20:37] not a lot of fun up there either.
[20:40] So all the way, if you want to be
[20:43] successful, you got the bottom that
[20:45] sucks. The middle is extremely hard and
[20:49] the top it sucks worse than all of it.
[20:54] So you better learn how to get the
[20:56] auction at the very top. So why do you
[20:58] care about what people are thinking when
[21:01] they're not trying to go where the [ __ ]
[21:03] you're trying to go? And that's the
[21:05] whole moral of the story.
[21:11] So, we have in our business, it's not a
[21:14] typical sales deal, right? Like when I
[21:17] was in real estate, if I didn't sell you
[21:18] a house, I didn't sell you a house. You
[21:20] had a place to live. You know, if I
[21:22] didn't sell you I stole construction
[21:25] material, if you're in solar and don't
[21:26] sell somebody solar, it's all good. In
[21:30] our business, if we don't make a sale,
[21:33] somebody dies with zero life insurance
[21:35] or not enough. That's that's honestly no
[21:37] [ __ ] I was social worker 14 years,
[21:39] found this. I was like, "Dude, this is
[21:41] social work, but I get paid more and
[21:43] then I can bring people on." If these
[21:45] all these men and women work with you
[21:47] and and you could get them to because
[21:49] that's what I try to get to and I and
[21:50] I'm I need to get a million times better
[21:52] at it cuz I'm actually people are like,
[21:54] "How'd you sell a lot?" I didn't want to
[21:56] leave anybody unprotected and [ __ ] if I
[21:58] had to piss them off, upset them, make
[21:59] them uncomfortable, make them give me
[22:01] [ __ ] make them judge me, make whatever
[22:02] I had to do, I wanted them. And and when
[22:05] I got my first death claim, three months
[22:06] in, 32-y old dude died in a motorcycle
[22:08] accident, got quarter million dollars. I
[22:10] was like, "Oh, everybody's getting
[22:11] covered." How do we h how what what's
[22:14] your advice? What is your advice, David,
[22:16] on because I always went to what's the
[22:18] worst thing that could happen? Well,
[22:19] [ __ ] I can screw this family up for
[22:21] nobody came to my mom's apartment when
[22:23] my grandma died. We had no life
[22:24] insurance. Grandpa, aunts, uncles,
[22:26] friends. I didn't even know what life
[22:28] insurance was until I got to be old and
[22:30] goddamn life insurance. I didn't have
[22:31] life insurance till I got my life
[22:32] insurance license. How do we get h
[22:34] what's your advice to all of us, me
[22:35] included, on how we approach that
[22:37] knowing that we can really screw things
[22:40] up if we don't do everything we can? We
[22:41] can't make everybody buy it, but hell,
[22:43] we got to give more. And and in our
[22:45] deal, like you're here, clients over
[22:47] here. Until you're uncomfortable and
[22:48] they're uncomfortable, there's no
[22:49] freaking sale. No way. Because they sit
[22:51] here, you sit there, you give them your
[22:53] pitch. But you've got to get them
[22:55] uncomfortable. What's your advice for me
[22:56] and the rest of us on getting people
[22:58] uncomfortable and understand the
[22:59] consequences of what can happen if we
[23:00] don't do our job? Well, this is the
[23:03] thing. He said uncomfortable about three
[23:04] or four times. You guys heard that,
[23:06] right?
[23:07] >> Your job is to get people uncomfortable.
[23:11] It sucks. I work with a guy one time
[23:13] that made $75,000 a year and his job was
[23:16] very similar to yours and now he makes
[23:18] over a million. He worked he he called
[23:21] me up five years ago and said, "I want
[23:23] you to be my coach." And I taught him
[23:26] one thing. I had him out here doing all
[23:28] kind of crazy [ __ ] He goes, "Why are
[23:30] you doing this?" I go because your main
[23:32] job is to make people uncomfortable.
[23:36] But it's hard to make someone
[23:37] uncomfortable
[23:39] when you've never been uncomfortable
[23:41] yourself.
[23:43] So, a lot of people in this room
[23:46] aren't pushing themselves to that
[23:48] uncomfortable place.
[23:50] And that is the first thing you have.
[23:52] You have to know what uncomfortable
[23:53] feels like. So when you're pushing
[23:56] someone to that place,
[23:58] you know how to talk them through it.
[24:02] Because if you haven't experienced it
[24:04] and you haven't gotten the knowledge
[24:06] from it, it is impossible to push
[24:08] someone there because the second they
[24:10] get uncomfortable, you are now
[24:11] uncomfortable.
[24:13] You are now in your feelings. You are
[24:16] now feeling bad for this person. You now
[24:18] feel that they're uncomfortable because
[24:21] you don't know how to walk them through
[24:23] the uncomfort.
[24:25] And that is the most important thing
[24:28] that you have to learn is there is
[24:31] theorist and there's practitioners.
[24:34] A lot of theorists will tell you how
[24:36] uncomfortable feels.
[24:38] The practitioners are the ones that have
[24:40] experienced uncomfortable and they know
[24:43] exactly the steps on how to get through
[24:46] being uncomfortable. So then you now
[24:48] have the science about it. So while
[24:51] you're talking to this individual and
[24:53] they're feeling uncomfortable, you know
[24:55] exactly how to break them down and find
[24:57] a way in to their heart so they come out
[25:00] with the insurance that they need in the
[25:02] long run.
[25:04] >> It's amazing.
[25:07] One of the other things we we struggle a
[25:09] lot with is and it might be the same
[25:11] with people that work out competing is
[25:14] and I was I was talking to a guy earlier
[25:15] this morning. I said, "What's your
[25:16] biggest issue?" He said, "I found a way
[25:19] to make money." And then he said to me,
[25:21] "But I self-sabotaged." Which I think is
[25:22] [ __ ] in my opinion. I think that's
[25:24] just a madeup. Like, it's awesome way to
[25:25] let people off the hook. Oh, you just
[25:27] didn't do No, dude. You didn't do the
[25:28] work. You didn't sell. You don't wake up
[25:30] and go, "I'm going to destroy it. I'm
[25:31] now all of a sudden I'm not
[25:32] accountable." But the struggle has been
[25:34] for a lot of folks is I didn't want to
[25:36] be on the hamster wheel for the next 60
[25:38] years. When I got my life insurance
[25:39] license, what scared me the most was I
[25:41] was going to people's houses that were
[25:43] 75 years old and they like were broke as
[25:46] all [ __ ] and I'm like I don't ever want
[25:49] to like outlive any money and be able to
[25:51] not support myself.
[25:54] The complacency that sets in because I
[25:56] was raised if we had and again you got
[25:58] to figure out what your motivator is.
[26:00] Mine was never money. It was this. I I
[26:02] don't know that I saw this or didn't see
[26:04] this, but I'm like, if these idiots,
[26:05] because I met them, if they can run a
[26:06] company, and I've met them, [ __ ] I can
[26:08] do it, too. But a lot of folks get here
[26:11] and and money's their their their
[26:13] barometer. I have enough to live, so I'm
[26:16] good. Maybe the gentleman that you
[26:17] coach, maybe someone I have enough to
[26:19] live, so I'm good. What What's your
[26:21] advice on people actually realizing
[26:24] there's a hell of a lot more and they'll
[26:25] do it. They'll come in here and they'll
[26:27] work 60 hours a week
[26:29] >> and then 40 hours a week and then I got
[26:31] money. Then they go on vacation for 3
[26:33] weeks,
[26:33] >> right?
[26:34] >> And then they want to know what the
[26:34] problem is. And in our business, it's an
[26:37] advanced business. So the money can
[26:38] charge back. How do you help us
[26:40] understand to keep freaking going,
[26:41] especially when it feels good, like it's
[26:43] getting good. How do we make it great or
[26:46] not go backwards?
[26:47] >> So a lot of you will not agree with
[26:49] this, which is fine.
[26:52] So, don't take this literally because
[26:56] don't ever cap this,
[26:59] but I cap my success.
[27:02] I'm not saying cap your money. I'm not
[27:05] saying any of that. I say this is just
[27:07] my term. So, every single year, so I'm
[27:10] I've made millions of dollars,
[27:13] very well off. I don't need to work ever
[27:15] again. But every year I go to British
[27:18] Columbia and I jump out of airplanes and
[27:21] I'm a smoke jumper
[27:23] and I lose about $5 million a year
[27:27] to smoke jump for four to five months a
[27:31] year. Everybody goes, "Why the hell do
[27:33] you do that?"
[27:35] Because on my journey trying to get to
[27:37] where I'm in today, I found out that all
[27:40] the knowledge for me came at the bottom.
[27:43] And how I stay hungry is I literally go
[27:46] back to the bottom. I go back. I pick up
[27:49] a shovel. I pick up a pilaski. Someone's
[27:53] in charge of me. Some 20some year old
[27:55] kid. I'm damn near 50 [ __ ] years old.
[27:57] I got some 20-year-old kid still digging
[27:59] in his nose and digging his ass in
[28:01] charge of me. But it humbles me because
[28:05] I want to be the best. And a lot of
[28:08] people in here,
[28:10] they might just be okay
[28:13] with just that money to live. And that's
[28:17] the thing that I realized a long time
[28:18] ago in my life is there's some people I
[28:21] can't motivate. There's some people in
[28:24] this room that when I speak, they're
[28:26] rolling their eyes. This guy's [ __ ]
[28:29] David Gaga is ridiculous [ __ ] His
[28:31] passion, his motivation, his drive is
[28:32] all [ __ ] crazy. It is because I found
[28:38] out a long time ago what I'm supposed to
[28:40] be in this world
[28:42] and that hunger is going to stay with me
[28:45] until I'm dead.
[28:47] You have to have that kind of want in
[28:49] your life. If you're fine with waking up
[28:52] every morning and having just enough to
[28:55] go on vacation and come back and you
[28:57] work again, that's good for you. But
[29:00] you're in this room for a [ __ ]
[29:02] reason. And a lot of you in this room
[29:05] will leave this conference and you will
[29:07] go bust your ass and you'll be motivated
[29:10] as hell because you heard somebody speak
[29:12] and the fire is built up. But guess what
[29:15] happens four months from now?
[29:18] There's a trend in every single in every
[29:20] single job. They have a conference,
[29:24] they're kicking ass, they're kicking
[29:25] ass, they're kicking ass, and then it's
[29:26] like, "Ah, [ __ ] I don't have any more
[29:28] motivation,
[29:30] man. And I was making I was killing it
[29:32] last four months. What the [ __ ]
[29:34] happened? This conference took you and
[29:38] elevated you to the next [ __ ] level.
[29:40] But then the real you came out. The real
[29:44] you might be unmotivated.
[29:46] Might have no determination, no passion,
[29:49] no drive.
[29:51] But like I said, why the [ __ ] did I have
[29:54] you all yell at the top of your lungs
[29:57] when I came out?
[29:59] Because on those dark days, you still
[30:03] have to find more. And if and if you
[30:05] don't want to find more for yourself,
[30:08] look to your left and look to your
[30:10] right. If you got a mom, a dad, a wife,
[30:12] a husband, kids,
[30:14] make sure you may be fine with that
[30:17] little bit of money you have and you're
[30:19] good.
[30:21] Try to make generational [ __ ] wealth.
[30:24] >> Amen.
[30:26] If you're good,
[30:29] be that person when a [ __ ] fire
[30:31] happens in the room like this. I
[30:32] guarantee most of you [ __ ] will
[30:34] look at me. Where's Gogggins going? I'm
[30:37] going to follow that [ __ ]
[30:40] You want to be that [ __ ] for
[30:42] your family that when all hell breaks
[30:45] loose, they know that even though you're
[30:48] good by yourself, you got a family to
[30:50] take care of and you have made enough
[30:53] for them that they fall on their [ __ ]
[30:55] ass, you can pick them up.
[30:59] So, there's a lot of things out there
[31:01] that should keep you going in life. And
[31:02] if if that's not enough,
[31:05] you need to look at that dirty mirror
[31:07] again and see why you're really doing it
[31:08] for.
[31:09] >> Wow.
[31:12] So when you listen and I I'm 10 years
[31:15] I've been doing this 15 10 years. I've
[31:18] been doing the we do these meetings
[31:21] and this the first time. First of all,
[31:24] I've been sober 23 years, but sitting
[31:27] next Thank you. But sitting next to you
[31:30] is the closest I felt to being back
[31:32] smoking crack and sniffing cocaine. And
[31:35] I'm gonna be I'm just being honest. I'm
[31:36] not lying. I'm being honest. Sorry. I'm
[31:37] honest. I feel like we're getting ready.
[31:39] I'm I'm too old. I'm 51. But I feel like
[31:41] we're being ready to take the football
[31:42] field and I just played around with an
[31:44] eightball and I'm ready to go and we're
[31:46] going to kill somebody. Like that's how
[31:47] I actually feel. Which means the shit's
[31:49] contagious. And I've never met anybody
[31:51] that I've sat next to. I met a lot of
[31:53] smarter people, but I ain't met nobody
[31:54] had more energy than me. And I'm like
[31:56] he's straight as [ __ ] be sober. It's
[31:58] contagious.
[31:59] >> Yeah.
[32:00] >> It's But and and I love what you said,
[32:02] be that for your family, right? Cuz when
[32:04] people come up and go, "My dad, I was
[32:06] talking to Sean, this kid, Sean Junior."
[32:08] He's like, "Uh, you're I'm like, "No,
[32:09] your dad's it, dude. Like, your dad has
[32:11] his own business. I ain't your dad's
[32:12] boss. Everybody's independent. I ain't
[32:15] your dad's boss. Your dad's a boss of
[32:18] your family."
[32:20] All these folks
[32:22] have to understand, and I want you to
[32:24] speak to this, please. Everybody on
[32:26] their team's watching them. Every
[32:29] freaking And by the way, nobody here is
[32:30] rolling their eyes talking [ __ ] about
[32:31] you. I promise you. Number one, they're
[32:34] scared you might see them from here. And
[32:36] number two, peer pressure, the most
[32:37] powerful person in the world. Somebody
[32:38] next to you will be like, "Dude, stop
[32:39] shaking your freaking head or I'll hit
[32:40] you and it'll keep spinning around.
[32:42] Guarantee it. Promise you."
[32:46] Talk to us about that because that's
[32:48] what kills me. I had a guy tell me one
[32:49] day, he goes, "You know why that guy's
[32:50] team don't grow?" I go, "No." He goes,
[32:51] "Dumps his [ __ ] downhill. He has a bad
[32:54] day. He dumps on everybody and he
[32:56] paralyzes them. Everybody. And I watch
[32:58] these people. Watch them. They're
[33:00] watching their moves. They're feeling
[33:02] their energy. Good or bad. I've been up
[33:04] here on stage doing these things with
[33:06] people that charge way too much money
[33:08] that are uber famous. I'd rather be
[33:11] shoving thumbtacks in my eyeball. It's
[33:13] so [ __ ] bad. Seriously. Tell help us
[33:17] understand.
[33:18] Everybody's watching. Everybody. The
[33:22] thing about it is you all know
[33:23] everybody's watching and this is the
[33:25] thing. So, have you have have have you
[33:27] guys heard of my thing called Taking
[33:28] Souls?
[33:29] >> Yeah.
[33:31] >> Okay. For those of you who haven't, I'm
[33:33] going to give you a short story. So,
[33:34] everybody's watching.
[33:36] And so, when I started figuring out what
[33:39] I want to be in life, I want to be a
[33:41] leader. I want to be the leader. Like I
[33:44] said, when a fire breaks out, they look
[33:46] at you. And what that means is this.
[33:50] It was Wednesday of my second hell week.
[33:53] We had been up the whole time. Hadn't
[33:55] got any sleep.
[33:57] And so there's about three bolt crews
[33:59] left, which means there's not many
[34:01] people left. Like over, I don't know,
[34:04] 80, 90 people are quit. We're down to
[34:06] just three boat crews. So we go into the
[34:09] med check
[34:11] and they go in, they check us out.
[34:14] Everybody is hypothermic. Everybody's
[34:16] all jacked up. and Wednesday
[34:20] you're a zombie. That's what the pass
[34:23] down. So the pass down is through years
[34:26] they tell you on Wednesday you're a
[34:27] zombie. You're walking around like this
[34:30] because you don't want your clothes to
[34:32] touch you cuz you're soaking wet. You
[34:34] got the ocean and you're and you're just
[34:36] pissing on yourself to get warm.
[34:39] So you you like that, didn't you?
[34:43] So
[34:44] basically what happens is you go to
[34:46] medcheek, they have these a crates. The
[34:50] a crates have your nice dry clothes in
[34:52] them. But what happens is the
[34:54] instructors are there [ __ ] putting
[34:56] water in them. So those dry clothes are
[34:58] now [ __ ] wet. And all the students
[35:01] are just like poopy pants. Like [ __ ] I
[35:05] got to put these [ __ ] wet clothes on.
[35:07] And they're putting them on slow and the
[35:09] instructors are yelling. But now the
[35:12] instructors know that they're zombies
[35:14] because that because the instructors
[35:15] were zombies on Wednesday. So they're
[35:17] giving us a little bit of leash. This
[35:19] goes somewhere. So this work with me for
[35:21] a second. So we got three boats. Boat
[35:24] crew one, boat crew 2, and the Smurf
[35:27] crew. The Smurf crew is has a smurf on
[35:30] the front of the boat because they're
[35:32] the shortest guys in the class.
[35:36] Smurf crew.
[35:38] So boat crew one. They're the tallest
[35:40] guys. Boat crew two, the second tallest
[35:41] guys and so on and so forth. There's
[35:43] only three boat crews up here. So,
[35:46] everybody gets under their boat and
[35:48] they're standing there with the boat on
[35:49] top of their head and everybody's doing
[35:51] this [ __ ] To answer your question,
[35:54] I look back, I am [ __ ] up. My feet, my
[35:58] hands, my neck, my whole body is just
[36:01] messed up. And I'm looking at like
[36:04] everything slowed down. I'm looking at
[36:05] all these people under these boats and
[36:07] they're just sitting there jackhammering
[36:09] and heads are down and the motivation is
[36:12] gone.
[36:14] And I said, "David, this is exactly
[36:18] where you wanted to. This is your time.
[36:21] This is your time. You're amongst the
[36:23] baddest [ __ ] in the world right
[36:25] now and everybody's [ __ ] up. This is
[36:29] my internal dialogue right now. What are
[36:32] you going to [ __ ] do, man? You got
[36:33] This is your shot, man. Man, this is
[36:35] your [ __ ] shot. I'm in the front of
[36:37] the boat crew. The front of the boat is
[36:39] the heaviest part of the boat. I'm
[36:42] looking at my boat crew and they're all
[36:43] just [ __ ] I want this to end, but
[36:45] it's not going to end till Friday. We
[36:47] got two more [ __ ] days of this [ __ ]
[36:50] So, I'm like in the front of the boat.
[36:52] I'm like, you know what, man? So, the
[36:54] instructors are at Boat Crew One.
[36:56] They're saying, "All right,
[36:57] [ __ ] Pick the boat up." And
[37:00] we've been picking this boat up now
[37:02] forever. But now, for some reason, no
[37:04] one can pick the [ __ ] boat up. So,
[37:06] here they are,
[37:08] and it's going back to their head. So,
[37:10] I'm looking at my I go, "Okay, look
[37:12] guys." So, I turn around, my boat crew,
[37:14] there's five guys behind me. I said,
[37:16] "Look, [ __ ]
[37:20] Don't be a [ __ ] punk.
[37:23] I want you to look at these [ __ ]
[37:26] instructors because they were where we
[37:28] were years ago under these boats.
[37:32] And I want them to think about they
[37:34] never seen a bow crew like B crew too.
[37:37] We are going to [ __ ] take their
[37:39] [ __ ] souls today.
[37:42] So I start to juice these mother and so
[37:46] you get juiced up false re false
[37:49] motivation becomes what? Real
[37:51] motivation. So now they're starting to
[37:54] feel the juice. So it starts come by.
[37:57] All right, boat crew 2. But right now,
[37:59] boat crew 2 has said, "Fuck it. We're
[38:01] gonna pick the boat up before you tell
[38:02] us to pick the boat up." So the boat's
[38:04] up. Now we're starting to boat press it.
[38:07] And all we're saying is you can't hurt
[38:09] boat crew, too. And now our boat crew
[38:14] puts the boat down. They let us put the
[38:15] boat down because we showed something
[38:17] that no one else had. So by us putting
[38:20] out more, we got a chance to rest. So,
[38:24] as we're resting, I turn around the B
[38:25] crew. It says all these [ __ ]
[38:28] instructors, I want to make sure from
[38:32] Wednesday to Friday, they cannot sleep
[38:35] with their [ __ ] wives because they're
[38:37] thinking about brok.
[38:41] [Applause]
[38:45] So to answer your question, you want to
[38:49] be that one [ __ ]
[38:52] that every day, whether it's raining,
[38:55] snowing, sleeping, you lost every dime,
[38:58] your mom died, your dad died, you come
[39:02] and you bring the energy that it takes
[39:05] to make a team function at the highest
[39:08] [ __ ] level every day. And that's the
[39:11] person you want to be every day of your
[39:14] life.
[39:17] Wow.
[39:19] [Applause]
[39:25] So, I didn't you you I mean I I I was
[39:28] reading your biography
[39:30] on all the races and I got tired just
[39:34] reading it. Then I read it again. But I
[39:38] did not know I knew early that that
[39:41] mission and these races runs you started
[39:44] that to raise money,
[39:45] >> right?
[39:46] >> Can you tell us about that?
[39:48] >> You want the whole story?
[39:49] >> Sure. You do what you want, bro. It's
[39:51] your stage.
[39:52] >> All right. So, basically how this all
[39:54] started for me. A lot of you may know
[39:55] the story, but um after I became a Navy
[39:58] Seal, you guys lone survivor.
[40:01] >> Yep. Well, Marcus Latrell is one of my
[40:03] best friends and so is his twin brother
[40:06] Morgan Latril.
[40:09] So, funny story about Marcus and Morgan.
[40:11] It's actually in my audio book, Can't
[40:12] Hurt Me, is that Morgan was not in the
[40:16] military. Marcus was in the military
[40:19] first. Long story short, Marcus couldn't
[40:21] run for [ __ ]
[40:23] Morgan ran one of his four mile time
[40:26] runs. They didn't even know it was a
[40:29] flop of twins and passed it for Marcus.
[40:32] Anyway, little inside tip. So, what
[40:36] happened was Marcus was on a mission,
[40:39] mission went bad, a bunch of guys died.
[40:41] I was in three hell weeks. So, damn near
[40:45] everybody on that op I was in hell week
[40:47] with. So, when I heard the news, I was
[40:52] in military freef fall school with
[40:54] Marcus's twin brother, Morgan.
[40:57] And I got the call telling me that I
[41:01] have to tell Morgan that his that Marcus
[41:04] was dead.
[41:06] Marcus was not dead. They thought he was
[41:08] dead. So I told Morgan they believe that
[41:11] Marcus is dead. They can't find him.
[41:13] Everybody else is dead. They can't find
[41:15] Marcus. They believe he's dead. Morgan
[41:17] looked at me and said, "He's not."
[41:20] I'm like, "What the [ __ ] you talking
[41:23] about, bro?"
[41:25] He was right. He wasn't dead. Four days
[41:28] later, Morgan calls me up. Hey, bro.
[41:29] They found my [ __ ] brother. Go suck
[41:31] it. I was like, "All right."
[41:34] So, at this time,
[41:37] I weighed 191 when I joined the
[41:40] military.
[41:42] I went to 250 after I became a Navy
[41:44] Seal.
[41:46] So, that story touched me so much that I
[41:48] started googling different races. I
[41:51] wanted to raise money for the Special
[41:52] Operations Warrior Foundation. It's a
[41:54] foundation that if your if your dad was
[41:56] in the military, he's a special
[41:58] operator, he died, your son or daughter
[42:01] would get full tuition to go to college.
[42:03] So, I'm like, I'm going to go do this.
[42:06] But being a Navy Seal, I couldn't do a
[42:08] hot dog or hamburger competition, you
[42:10] know, do something like that. But, so I
[42:12] looked up the 10 hardest races in the
[42:14] world,
[42:15] and what came up was the Bad Water 135.
[42:20] And me not being an ultrar runner, my
[42:22] workout was literally I hit the weights
[42:25] every day and Sunday I did the
[42:28] elliptical trainer for 20 [ __ ]
[42:30] minutes. No cardio, just that's all I
[42:33] did for cardio. So I Googled this [ __ ]
[42:37] and what came up was the Bad Water 135.
[42:40] So I called the race director up and
[42:42] said, "Hey man, I want to do this race
[42:43] to raise money for this foundation." He
[42:46] goes, "Are you an ultrarunner?" I was
[42:49] like, "What is that?" He's like, "You
[42:52] know, do you run 100 mile races or I go
[42:54] 100 mile races? I I didn't know this
[42:56] [ __ ] even existed." So, long story
[42:58] short, he goes, "Look, man, you got to
[43:00] run a 100 miles in 24 hours or less to
[43:04] get into the Badwater,
[43:07] and if you can do that, I will consider
[43:09] you in my race." The application process
[43:12] ended in January. I called the cat up in
[43:16] November and he said, "Well,
[43:19] if you really want to get in the race,
[43:22] there is a race in San Diego called the
[43:24] San Diego One Day." I call him up on a
[43:27] Wednesday. This race was Saturday.
[43:31] I had done no running. And he goes,
[43:34] "Okay, check it out. You get in it, you
[43:36] run 100 miles, 24 hours, I can see you
[43:39] my race." So, there's a onem track in
[43:42] San Diego. It was called a San Diego One
[43:44] Day. You want to run a onem track, see
[43:46] how far you can get. So I said, "Fuck
[43:49] it." I signed up for the race. At the
[43:52] time I was married. I get I go to
[43:54] Walmart, get a blue lawn chair. I have
[43:57] Rich Crackers and Milelex.
[44:00] That's what I have for the whole damn
[44:01] race. So I realize I'm going to see this
[44:04] chair every single one mile loop. And
[44:07] I'll get some Milelex and a Ritz
[44:09] cracker. Stupid.
[44:13] I had no idea the [ __ ] I was doing. But
[44:15] I'm going to cut to the chase. Here I
[44:17] am. I get to mile 70
[44:21] and I never ran past 20 miles in my
[44:24] entire [ __ ] life. And I'm I'm in this
[44:26] chair at mile 70. What do you think
[44:28] happens to you when you are sucking on a
[44:31] rich cracker ball because your mouth is
[44:32] dehydrated, all [ __ ] up, and you're
[44:35] drinking Mileplex? What do you think
[44:36] happens to you at mile 70 being that you
[44:39] never trained for this and hadn't gone
[44:40] that far in your life? Your body starts
[44:43] to literally die and break down. So I'm
[44:47] sitting there in this chair and I have
[44:50] to go to the bathroom. Haven't gone to
[44:52] the bathroom in 12, 13 hours. The
[44:54] bathroom's from me to the damn wall
[44:56] right there. So I'm trying to get up but
[44:58] I can't get up. My blood pressure is all
[45:00] messed up. And I look over and I look at
[45:04] my ex-wife. I'm like, "Hey,
[45:07] I'm going to take a [ __ ] on myself right
[45:08] now
[45:10] because I can't get up and my blood
[45:12] pressure is all [ __ ] up and I'm dizzy
[45:15] as shit." So, I'm sitting there [ __ ]
[45:17] up my back and peeing blood down my leg.
[45:22] I got 30 [ __ ] miles to go. And this
[45:25] is where I'm at right now. And there's
[45:27] one thing a black man never wants to
[45:30] [ __ ] hear. She looked at me and she
[45:32] said, "You're starting to turn white.
[45:39] It's a [ __ ] long day.
[45:42] So, I'm sitting there. I'm looking at
[45:45] her and this is where the 40% rule came
[45:48] from. So, I'm trying to raise this money
[45:52] and I'm all jacked up. So, in life, you
[45:55] guys are going to come to a point in
[45:57] your life, maybe not quite this [ __ ]
[45:59] up, but where you don't want to go on
[46:01] anymore.
[46:03] So, what I do is I quit. I don't really
[46:07] quit. I let my mind know that we're
[46:10] going to [ __ ] bag it for the day. 70
[46:12] miles in, I'm good. But I didn't quit
[46:15] yet. But I'm telling myself I'm going to
[46:17] quit. I'm sitting here in this chair.
[46:21] I'm like, "Okay, I can't get the [ __ ]
[46:22] up. I'm really messed up. I'm got [ __ ]
[46:24] everywhere and this is messed up." So,
[46:26] I'm cleaning myself up and there's an
[46:29] aid station that I haven't been using
[46:31] that has peanut butter and jelly, salt
[46:33] tablets, and bananas. Real food that I
[46:36] [ __ ] need some water and [ __ ] right
[46:38] now. I need something. So, I have my
[46:40] ex-wife bring me over some food. I'm
[46:42] going to sit here because I'm going to
[46:43] quit pretty soon, but just not yet. Let
[46:45] me get cleaned up first. Let me get
[46:47] something to eat. What this does to your
[46:49] mind is it takes pressure
[46:52] off of your brain for a second. 30 more
[46:56] [ __ ] miles you don't want to think
[46:57] about when you got [ __ ] up your back.
[47:00] So, I'm sitting there and I'm eating
[47:01] some food. I'm like, "Okay, man. My
[47:05] blood pressure is a little bit better.
[47:07] I'm going to walk to the car, but before
[47:09] I walk to the car, it'd be pretty badass
[47:12] if I can walk one mile and then I'll
[47:15] quit."
[47:17] I walked a mile.
[47:19] Long story short, that one mile became
[47:22] 30 [ __ ] miles.
[47:31] And that's the thing that we do a lot in
[47:33] life.
[47:34] What we do is when we have a goal, my
[47:37] goal was to raise money for this
[47:38] foundation. Now, I'm not saying go to my
[47:40] extent. This is all take what I say with
[47:42] the great just take it take little bits
[47:44] of what I say. You're not trying to be
[47:46] [ __ ] David Gogggins. You're trying to
[47:48] be the best you possible. But that
[47:51] requires knowing how to take mental
[47:55] breaks when [ __ ] gets hard. It's not
[47:57] quitting.
[47:59] Just take a [ __ ] break for a second.
[48:01] Get your breath because your mind is
[48:04] panicked. You're sporadic. It's called
[48:06] the one second decision. I saw so many
[48:09] people who could have graduated Navy
[48:11] Seal training, but they get in that
[48:13] [ __ ] cold water during hell week.
[48:17] Think about hell week. Hell week is five
[48:19] days, 130 hours of continuous training.
[48:22] You might get two hours of sleep, but
[48:25] you go through three to five weeks of
[48:27] training
[48:29] before you get to hell week. So all hell
[48:32] week is is no sleep. It's the same [ __ ]
[48:34] you were doing. Nothing different. But
[48:38] your mind spazzes the [ __ ] out hour one
[48:41] when they put you in that cold water
[48:43] that you've been in a thousand times.
[48:45] You get in that cold water and you freak
[48:47] out. You don't remember that I've been
[48:50] this water before a thousand times. You
[48:52] don't remember I've done this [ __ ]
[48:54] before. So in that one second decision,
[48:58] your mind can't process 130 hours. It's
[49:00] too much. So you quit.
[49:04] And once you quit, you take that warm
[49:06] shower. And guess what happens? You have
[49:09] regret. So you have to learn how to
[49:12] manage that one second decision. And
[49:15] what that is is this.
[49:17] If you do 130 hours,
[49:21] every second you have to win. If you
[49:26] lose one [ __ ] second of that 130
[49:31] hours, you will not be a Navy Seal.
[49:34] In life, it's the same way. If you lose
[49:38] one second, not take a break. If you
[49:40] make a bad decision and just hang it up
[49:43] in that one second, you will [ __ ]
[49:46] regret it. You must win every second.
[49:49] You must be in control of your life
[49:52] every second of your life or you will
[49:55] lose. So that's the biggest thing. Never
[49:57] forget your goals. Many dreams die while
[50:02] suffering.
[50:04] Don't be one of those people whose
[50:05] dreams die while you're suffering. Learn
[50:07] to manage your mind.
[50:09] Wow. Unbelievable.
[50:12] All right, we're wrapping up. I need
[50:14] your help with something. We wrap up
[50:16] here after you. You close it out. We
[50:19] have a dinner break. We got an award
[50:21] ceremony. We give out, you know, we have
[50:24] 5,000 people. We probably got 500 people
[50:26] started to get awards. They'll be here.
[50:28] They're getting awards. The best thing
[50:29] that anybody ever did to me when I got
[50:30] the insurance business, the guy made me
[50:32] go to the awards ceremony. I've been
[50:33] there for four months. I said, I've been
[50:34] here four months. He said, I want you to
[50:36] go to the ceremony. I want you to see
[50:37] the people get the awards and I want you
[50:39] to realize that if they can do it, [ __ ]
[50:41] you definitely can do it. I want you to
[50:42] sit in your chair and think of what it
[50:44] feel like when you go achieve it. I went
[50:46] like he told me to and I watched and I
[50:48] was like, the dude just tripped over the
[50:51] stairs. The dude went the wrong way. The
[50:53] number one guy talked about himself for
[50:55] 45 minutes and a little dude, I'll never
[50:58] do that when I take that award next year
[50:59] because that was really egotistical.
[51:02] Can you help me speak life into the
[51:04] people that are thinking about going and
[51:05] getting dinner, going getting drunk,
[51:07] going to watch a game, and convincing
[51:10] them that
[51:12] coming back here is a great decision for
[51:13] their family.
[51:15] All right. There's a phrase I always
[51:17] say, and this phrase needs to stick with
[51:20] you for the rest of your life.
[51:23] There's a lot of people who want to go
[51:25] back, watch the game, get a drink, bag
[51:29] it. They want to bag the rest of the
[51:31] day.
[51:33] But the question is, are you done yet?
[51:37] Are you truly finished with what you
[51:38] came to do?
[51:41] And so my phrase that I've said to
[51:43] myself for a lot of years, and I say it
[51:46] in the darkest of times,
[51:50] don't stop when you're tired.
[51:52] Stop when you're done. So remember that.
[51:55] Are you done? A lot of you are not done.
[51:59] So don't sit back and be that bad team
[52:01] member
[52:03] because everybody's watching you and
[52:05] everybody's gonna know you [ __ ]
[52:07] bagged it. This is all part of being a
[52:10] [ __ ] leader. Being a leader [ __ ]
[52:13] sucks. You do everything in life that
[52:16] you do not want to do. You are unhappy
[52:19] 90% of your life.
[52:22] But that means that other people
[52:25] are eating because of you. They're
[52:27] living because of you. They're achieving
[52:29] because of you. So, are you really in
[52:31] that bad a shape? So, make a decision
[52:34] tonight. Do you want to be a leader or
[52:37] do you want to be that person who just
[52:40] bags it and does their own [ __ ] And
[52:43] then you can ask yourself that question
[52:44] when you go home after bagging it. Look
[52:47] in that dirty mirror and ask yourself
[52:49] one question. Do I really have what it
[52:52] takes to be a [ __ ] leader? I answer
[52:55] that question for you. No.

## Plain Text (for processing)

[Applause] Thank you. >> All right. Who's going to carry the boats? [Applause] >> All right. So, do you know why I demand that? Not for me. When I come out to every single audience, which you guys are one of the best ever. [Applause] The reason why I demand that from the audience is because I know what darkness looks like. >> I know what it feels like to be alone with no motivation, no drive, no passion. And what has to come out of your [ __ ] soul in the darkest of times is what you just did right there. So that's what I do. So people always like for the first 20ome years of my life it was just darkness. But if you are able to get up every morning have no passion, no drive, no motivation, no [ __ ] and still get up with that kind of fire. You will be successful in life. I guarantee you that. >> That was okay. >> That was okay. >> It was okay. It wasn't great, but it was okay. One of the best is not the best, but we trying. I know. I know. All right. Well, first of all, thank you. Thanks for being here. Thanks for being who you are. Seriously. And thanks for just being straight. No [ __ ] >> Appreciate it. >> Because, and I was saying this, Dave, backstage. We've been doing this together for 10 years now. Some of you been here for 10 days. So, you've been here for three years, 10 years. And I've probably in 10 years said, "This book changed my life." Not many. I'll be honest with you. Um, the only one I read every day is the Bible and I read but but I if you've not read and I'll read them all now and I ain't bullshitting either because when I started reading it hurt me it honestly it really it really really screwed me up because I started feeling the pain >> right >> and it was like it was hurting me more because the whole title is it can't hurt me. We have all these amazing people out here, dude. And they're they're they're great human beings, but it is whatever it is in their life is hurting them. Whatever it happens to be, they eat what they kill here. That's it. Everybody you see out here, commission based sales. Every one of them. You seen a bunch up on stage killing it. They're great. But there's some right now, David, that are trying to figure out what to do tomorrow, next week, month. There's people out here right now. They ain't going to raise their hands because you're here. They're excited, but they're thinking about quitting. they're thinking about it. What would you say to just about that mindset and what it takes to do what we're doing? Because the pain is what I hear about, man. And you you you ain't nobody talks about that better than you. >> Well, the f Well, first of all, what you guys got to understand, guys and gals understand is that I keep it real. I'm not super human. I'm definitely not Superman. So when I talk to you all, understand these are the things that I had to tell myself. So you know, a lot of people come up here and start talking to you and they think they have all the damn answers and [ __ ] and they kind of talk down on people. No, no, no. I know exactly what it feels like to be lost, to want to quit every day of your life. And that's kind of what created me. So on my bad days, that's where all this taking souls and [ __ ] comes from. So on my bad days, I had to imagine a false reality. So for me, for instance, I was 300 pounds. A lot of you guys know my backstory. And a black kid there. I was the only 36 Africanamean Navy Seal in over 80 years. So think about this though. Think about how I wanted to quit. I was afraid of the water. My favorite meal was chocolate milkshakes with chocolate donuts. I didn't run and I was afraid of the water and I was 300 lb. And I have a pipe dream of going to go be a Navy Seal. Yeah, exactly. You should be laughing. Every morning I woke up and I had less than three months to lose 106 pounds to get into the Navy. Every morning I woke up, I wanted to quit. During runs, I quit. During my diet, I quit during swims. I quit. I quit every single day during this two and a half month. But the end of the day, what kept me going was I saw a video of 18 men graduating from Navy Seals training. And all I thought about was, what if what if my black ass can be up there on that [ __ ] stage one day and I can pull off this [ __ ] miracle that no one saw. There were no [ __ ] social media. There were no watch David Gogggins lose 106 pounds in two and a half months. There was no, you know, diet plan and [ __ ] I No, there was nothing. No one saw it. My mom, she's here in the audience right now. [Applause] [Music] She saw it and she's the only one that saw the transformation. But I knew it. I saw it. The whole accountability mirror that I talk about and can't hurt me. Every morning I woke up, I had a real conversation with that dirty mirror. And every day the same answer came back to me. Do you want to be on your deathbed knowing that you could, but you didn't? And so every day I kept saying that. I kept saying that. And before I knew it, two and a half months later, I lost the weight and I was going to Navy steel training. [Applause] >> So, which it sounds so [ __ ] crazy that you're afraid of water. >> Terrified. >> Terrified of water. and decided, [ __ ] it, I'm going to join the Seals. That's a good idea. The the guy you talked about in your book, right? Because you were trying to figure out what to do. You had that whole like medical issue, right? And then you went back. What did that guy see in you? What did cuz that guy, right, that one was the one like here's what you got to do. Here's like he didn't he he saw something. What did he see in you at that time that you didn't see? >> I don't know if he saw anything. >> Okay. >> Basically, what he was doing for me was doing his job. >> Got it. no one else. So, when I walked up to every recruiter, and there was a lot of them, and I would always go back to my mom's house like upset, but every recruiter saw what they saw. And that's the thing you guys got to get from me right now. A lot of people see what they see. Maybe you're out of shape. Maybe you look lazy, maybe look slovenly, maybe the maybe your outward appearance is not what it should be. No one saw what was inside of me. And that's the one thing I was afraid to pull this out because who I was, I was afraid kid, but something always said, "Man, you got more in you." And what this guy did was just did his job. >> He looked at me. I said, "I want to be a SEAL." He goes, "You got to do this, this, this, and this." Every other recruiter was like, "You're 300 [ __ ] pounds, bro. Like, you walking into my office with a chocolate milkshake." So, I don't blame them because what they saw, I would have said the same [ __ ] But this one recruiter, Stephen Saljo, I walked in, he goes, "I'm going to do my job. I don't think this kid's going to make it. There's no way, but I'm going to do my job." And just by him giving me an opportunity, I gave the guy a lot of money a couple years ago. And he's like, "What? What's this for? This is like literally 20ome years ago. I find Steve and Salio again and I gave him money. He goes, "What the hell you give me money for?" I go, "Because you did your [ __ ] job." And if you didn't do your job, I would never have found David Gogggins. >> Wow. >> So, I gave him a [ __ ] check for doing his [ __ ] job. >> Damn. >> And that's all he did. >> Well, I I got to be honest with you, David, before you got here. And by the way, your mom's amazing, but she's like watching you. You're in the room. You're like, they watching mother effing everything that's going on. She looking over here. I look at David. She looking at David. I'm like, hell, if this goes bad, I don't stand a damn chance. She >> She's got some essay, man. >> Yo, >> she's got some essay >> for real. So, my man brought in he had a And this it gets to a question. It's real important from accountability standpoint. So, my man brought in a a a plate of cookies, 15 sugar cookies. And I looked I didn't say nothing. He said, "Oh [ __ ] I got to get rid of the cookies, right? David's coming. So, he got rid of the cookies. And I said, >> "Dude, why are you more worried about David seeing the cookies than you eating the cookies, >> right?" >> Like, what's you probably ain't going to see David again after today except for on YouTube. Like, what's he going to do to you? >> How do people cuz that happens to you. It's got to people around you like, "Dude, I was just I thought I was supposed to start warming up." He went back. He about nine miles back there. I said, "Where'd he go?" He goes, "Keeps walking around." He stood still. Not at all. And I'm I'm walking around. I don't even know why I'm walking around cuz I feel bad about myself. How do we get people to be more accountable to themselves than they are everybody else who actually doesn't even matter? They're not even a stakeholder in their life. That was the one thing that I was trapped in. So, a lot of people don't know this story about me, but when I was coming up, so I went to all white school for a while and then I went to a majority black school for a short period of time. And I went to majority black school. See, I always wanted to be after, so I wanted to be a priest first. No one knows that. And then after that, I'm like, I want to go be in special operations. Like I said, there's only 36 African-Americans. So, you don't walk around a black community talking about, I want to go be in special operations. So, I tried to fit in. And by me trying to fit in with every group I was in, I lost myself. And so why I'm so polarizing now is because either you [ __ ] like me or you [ __ ] don't. And the reason why I was walking so much backstage, I'm nervous as [ __ ] to be out here in front of these people. Yeah. For real. >> My mom would tell you a story. When I was in elementary school, we moved from my dad's place where I got my ass beat. I had a lot of toxic stress. Hair was falling out of my head. I had a bunch of white splotches. And the biggest thing was I stuttered like a [ __ ] >> Bad. It's funny now. This [ __ ] wasn't funny when you were a [ __ ] kid. So, every time I get on stage, I think about one thing. We had a Christmas play and I was in maybe second, third grade, whatever it was. Didn't matter. I was young, but I stuttered horribly bad. And I'll never forget, the teacher gave me the smallest line possible because she knew this could be a [ __ ] train wreck. He may get up there and just act a fool. So, I got up there and I acted a fool and I just walked off [ __ ] stage. I couldn't say the I couldn't say [ __ ] I just went up there and just started just doing my [ __ ] Just started break dancing at the mouth. So, I walk off and every time I get on stage, I have to overcome that one feeling of looking out the audience and everybody and saying, "Oh shit." cuz I didn't cuss when I said in my mind there was no cuss words up there but I says so what happens is you have to gain this confidence because you lose yourself because you're always trying to hide from the stuttering or you're trying to hide from I wasn't that smart so I hid there I hid because I was only black person I hid because I wanted to be espec I was constantly hiding from these groups of people because I wanted to be accepted and the more I hid the more David Gagans became nothing. There was no David Gogggins. I was you when I was around you. I was Mary around Mary. I was John around John. There was no David Gogggins. And along this journey when I started losing weight and I had so many bad days in my life, so many bad days from growing up even now. Well, nobody [ __ ] there but David Gogggins. God was there, >> but God said, "Hey, [ __ ] I'm testing you today and I'm gonna test you tomorrow. I'm gonna test you again. I'm gonna let you I'm gonna let you alone, man. Pray all the [ __ ] you want. Pray. Get on your knees, boy. Pray. I'm going still kick your ass." >> So, the more I realized this is my journey and the more I realized where's all my friends? They ain't [ __ ] nowhere around. It was you. So, you better figure out who the [ __ ] you are on this journey. And those few people who don't many people don't like you, so be it. But you first have to figure out you because a lot of people die with a lot of untapped potential because they're trying to be somebody that they're not. >> Yeah. >> So, I was able to figure out my own potential by figuring out me. Dude, I was really prepared for you to be hardcore as [ __ ] but you're [ __ ] funny. Like really funny. I didn't know that. Like really funny. And I want to get to because I was watching something you posted the other day which I think was great because what a lot of the men and women in here are work with David is, you know, we call people up and sell them life insurance. And most of the people tend to get a pretty good grasp on that, right? Everybody's going to die. You need life insurance. You asked for it. Most people get pretty good grasp on that and and are able to monetize it, make a living, and then they have a choice to build a business and actually help other people. And I actually didn't start hiring people because I thought about spread. I had friends that had no job. They're broke. And I'm like, "Yo, you should do this." They're like, "Why?" I'm like, "It's easy." Like, that was how I started building a business. But a lot of the men and women we have here are paralyzed. They want to talk about it. They want to post. They want to talk to their friends, their family. They want to post something on social media, but they're truly terrified. If we could polygraph everybody in here, 80% of them would blow up. when we said, "Are you worried about what people think if you post and try to recruit?" And you'd post something recently about how many people don't even follow you. Like, I didn't know that [ __ ] Like, they don't even follow you, but they go on to comment. Like, they don't follow you. >> 23 million nonfollowers. >> 23 million people go on to talk [ __ ] Don't even follow you. They won't follow you. They don't want to see your content, but then they seek it out, see it, and then talk about it. How do you help everybody here truly? Because I suck it a lot, but I'm like a lot. And I'm like, dude, I really just don't care what anybody thinks at all. Like, if I come up here and do this interview and and and they're like, "That was terrible." If you're like, "Dude, that was awful." I'm like, "Dude, I gave it everything I got." Like, I'm I did the best I could and try to screw it up and give me feedback. I'll get better. How do we empower everybody in here? How do you empower everybody in here to just truly proceed, do whatever the hell they want with their business, ask everybody they run into, there's hundreds of millions of people in America. We do. We're we're we're for our business. We're a good big company, right? But none of that matters. We could be 10 times the size and still have too many people out there with no life insurance. How do we get these men and women to recruit people and not give a [ __ ] what anybody thinks or says about them? So, I have a question for you all, but only one person can answer it. What is your biggest fear? Why are you paralyzed? What what makes you nervous to just go out there and just be who you are and do what you have to do? I want to see one hand raise up to answer this question. You in the front, what is it? >> Past experience. >> So what? So failures. Okay, that's the perfect answer. And we did not set this up. So everybody asked me how the hell did I become successful when abused mindset, toxic stress, couldn't read and write, fat, name it, sickle cell. I I can't even be in the military nowadays with cickle cell. How the hell did I become successful when I had no passion, no drive, no nothing? And I'm going answer your question about what are you afraid of, right? You thought and you said failure. Everybody's afraid of failure. It's embarrassing as [ __ ] So how do you think I became successful when I failed every day of my life until I succeeded, which took a long time? The first thing I did was I All of you in this room want to be successful as hell. But the journey to success comes with a lot of what? >> Failure. So why the [ __ ] don't you teach yourself like I taught myself is how to fail properly. It's not saying be a failure. When I was 300 lb people think, oh, you really thought you could be a Navy Seal? No. I think I was going to [ __ ] lose the weight. But what it was was how I was able to get over all the failure and all the embarrassment of failing was I told myself, you are going to have to learn how to get up extremely fast because you are going to have a million setbacks on this journey. And that's how I literally taught myself how to fail first. Because I knew that if I was afraid of failure, I would have never been able to be a Navy Seal. I would have never been able to get to where I'm at today. So, I went through and I literally at 300 lbs or 297 to be exact. I sat back and I visualized how this journey is going to look in the first several months was nothing but failure. So, how am I going to get up the next morning when I failed the day before? How am I gonna eat this meal when I failed and I got fries and a milkshake again when I was supposed to get grilled chicken and rice? So, I went through and I taught myself how to fail. And when you do that, you're able to get up extremely fast and you no longer care about the end result because you know if I want to be way up here, it's going to take a bunch of small micro failures along the way. But you have to understand that that is part of the process. When you want to achieve the highest goal of all time, you are going to have to learn how to get your ass kicked all the way up that damn mountain. And then when you get up the mountain, the oxygen up there is very thin. It's hard to breathe. So it's not a lot of fun up there either. So all the way, if you want to be successful, you got the bottom that sucks. The middle is extremely hard and the top it sucks worse than all of it. So you better learn how to get the auction at the very top. So why do you care about what people are thinking when they're not trying to go where the [ __ ] you're trying to go? And that's the whole moral of the story. So, we have in our business, it's not a typical sales deal, right? Like when I was in real estate, if I didn't sell you a house, I didn't sell you a house. You had a place to live. You know, if I didn't sell you I stole construction material, if you're in solar and don't sell somebody solar, it's all good. In our business, if we don't make a sale, somebody dies with zero life insurance or not enough. That's that's honestly no [ __ ] I was social worker 14 years, found this. I was like, "Dude, this is social work, but I get paid more and then I can bring people on." If these all these men and women work with you and and you could get them to because that's what I try to get to and I and I'm I need to get a million times better at it cuz I'm actually people are like, "How'd you sell a lot?" I didn't want to leave anybody unprotected and [ __ ] if I had to piss them off, upset them, make them uncomfortable, make them give me [ __ ] make them judge me, make whatever I had to do, I wanted them. And and when I got my first death claim, three months in, 32-y old dude died in a motorcycle accident, got quarter million dollars. I was like, "Oh, everybody's getting covered." How do we h how what what's your advice? What is your advice, David, on because I always went to what's the worst thing that could happen? Well, [ __ ] I can screw this family up for nobody came to my mom's apartment when my grandma died. We had no life insurance. Grandpa, aunts, uncles, friends. I didn't even know what life insurance was until I got to be old and goddamn life insurance. I didn't have life insurance till I got my life insurance license. How do we get h what's your advice to all of us, me included, on how we approach that knowing that we can really screw things up if we don't do everything we can? We can't make everybody buy it, but hell, we got to give more. And and in our deal, like you're here, clients over here. Until you're uncomfortable and they're uncomfortable, there's no freaking sale. No way. Because they sit here, you sit there, you give them your pitch. But you've got to get them uncomfortable. What's your advice for me and the rest of us on getting people uncomfortable and understand the consequences of what can happen if we don't do our job? Well, this is the thing. He said uncomfortable about three or four times. You guys heard that, right? >> Your job is to get people uncomfortable. It sucks. I work with a guy one time that made $75,000 a year and his job was very similar to yours and now he makes over a million. He worked he he called me up five years ago and said, "I want you to be my coach." And I taught him one thing. I had him out here doing all kind of crazy [ __ ] He goes, "Why are you doing this?" I go because your main job is to make people uncomfortable. But it's hard to make someone uncomfortable when you've never been uncomfortable yourself. So, a lot of people in this room aren't pushing themselves to that uncomfortable place. And that is the first thing you have. You have to know what uncomfortable feels like. So when you're pushing someone to that place, you know how to talk them through it. Because if you haven't experienced it and you haven't gotten the knowledge from it, it is impossible to push someone there because the second they get uncomfortable, you are now uncomfortable. You are now in your feelings. You are now feeling bad for this person. You now feel that they're uncomfortable because you don't know how to walk them through the uncomfort. And that is the most important thing that you have to learn is there is theorist and there's practitioners. A lot of theorists will tell you how uncomfortable feels. The practitioners are the ones that have experienced uncomfortable and they know exactly the steps on how to get through being uncomfortable. So then you now have the science about it. So while you're talking to this individual and they're feeling uncomfortable, you know exactly how to break them down and find a way in to their heart so they come out with the insurance that they need in the long run. >> It's amazing. One of the other things we we struggle a lot with is and it might be the same with people that work out competing is and I was I was talking to a guy earlier this morning. I said, "What's your biggest issue?" He said, "I found a way to make money." And then he said to me, "But I self-sabotaged." Which I think is [ __ ] in my opinion. I think that's just a madeup. Like, it's awesome way to let people off the hook. Oh, you just didn't do No, dude. You didn't do the work. You didn't sell. You don't wake up and go, "I'm going to destroy it. I'm now all of a sudden I'm not accountable." But the struggle has been for a lot of folks is I didn't want to be on the hamster wheel for the next 60 years. When I got my life insurance license, what scared me the most was I was going to people's houses that were 75 years old and they like were broke as all [ __ ] and I'm like I don't ever want to like outlive any money and be able to not support myself. The complacency that sets in because I was raised if we had and again you got to figure out what your motivator is. Mine was never money. It was this. I I don't know that I saw this or didn't see this, but I'm like, if these idiots, because I met them, if they can run a company, and I've met them, [ __ ] I can do it, too. But a lot of folks get here and and money's their their their barometer. I have enough to live, so I'm good. Maybe the gentleman that you coach, maybe someone I have enough to live, so I'm good. What What's your advice on people actually realizing there's a hell of a lot more and they'll do it. They'll come in here and they'll work 60 hours a week >> and then 40 hours a week and then I got money. Then they go on vacation for 3 weeks, >> right? >> And then they want to know what the problem is. And in our business, it's an advanced business. So the money can charge back. How do you help us understand to keep freaking going, especially when it feels good, like it's getting good. How do we make it great or not go backwards? >> So a lot of you will not agree with this, which is fine. So, don't take this literally because don't ever cap this, but I cap my success. I'm not saying cap your money. I'm not saying any of that. I say this is just my term. So, every single year, so I'm I've made millions of dollars, very well off. I don't need to work ever again. But every year I go to British Columbia and I jump out of airplanes and I'm a smoke jumper and I lose about $5 million a year to smoke jump for four to five months a year. Everybody goes, "Why the hell do you do that?" Because on my journey trying to get to where I'm in today, I found out that all the knowledge for me came at the bottom. And how I stay hungry is I literally go back to the bottom. I go back. I pick up a shovel. I pick up a pilaski. Someone's in charge of me. Some 20some year old kid. I'm damn near 50 [ __ ] years old. I got some 20-year-old kid still digging in his nose and digging his ass in charge of me. But it humbles me because I want to be the best. And a lot of people in here, they might just be okay with just that money to live. And that's the thing that I realized a long time ago in my life is there's some people I can't motivate. There's some people in this room that when I speak, they're rolling their eyes. This guy's [ __ ] David Gaga is ridiculous [ __ ] His passion, his motivation, his drive is all [ __ ] crazy. It is because I found out a long time ago what I'm supposed to be in this world and that hunger is going to stay with me until I'm dead. You have to have that kind of want in your life. If you're fine with waking up every morning and having just enough to go on vacation and come back and you work again, that's good for you. But you're in this room for a [ __ ] reason. And a lot of you in this room will leave this conference and you will go bust your ass and you'll be motivated as hell because you heard somebody speak and the fire is built up. But guess what happens four months from now? There's a trend in every single in every single job. They have a conference, they're kicking ass, they're kicking ass, they're kicking ass, and then it's like, "Ah, [ __ ] I don't have any more motivation, man. And I was making I was killing it last four months. What the [ __ ] happened? This conference took you and elevated you to the next [ __ ] level. But then the real you came out. The real you might be unmotivated. Might have no determination, no passion, no drive. But like I said, why the [ __ ] did I have you all yell at the top of your lungs when I came out? Because on those dark days, you still have to find more. And if and if you don't want to find more for yourself, look to your left and look to your right. If you got a mom, a dad, a wife, a husband, kids, make sure you may be fine with that little bit of money you have and you're good. Try to make generational [ __ ] wealth. >> Amen. If you're good, be that person when a [ __ ] fire happens in the room like this. I guarantee most of you [ __ ] will look at me. Where's Gogggins going? I'm going to follow that [ __ ] You want to be that [ __ ] for your family that when all hell breaks loose, they know that even though you're good by yourself, you got a family to take care of and you have made enough for them that they fall on their [ __ ] ass, you can pick them up. So, there's a lot of things out there that should keep you going in life. And if if that's not enough, you need to look at that dirty mirror again and see why you're really doing it for. >> Wow. So when you listen and I I'm 10 years I've been doing this 15 10 years. I've been doing the we do these meetings and this the first time. First of all, I've been sober 23 years, but sitting next Thank you. But sitting next to you is the closest I felt to being back smoking crack and sniffing cocaine. And I'm gonna be I'm just being honest. I'm not lying. I'm being honest. Sorry. I'm honest. I feel like we're getting ready. I'm I'm too old. I'm 51. But I feel like we're being ready to take the football field and I just played around with an eightball and I'm ready to go and we're going to kill somebody. Like that's how I actually feel. Which means the shit's contagious. And I've never met anybody that I've sat next to. I met a lot of smarter people, but I ain't met nobody had more energy than me. And I'm like he's straight as [ __ ] be sober. It's contagious. >> Yeah. >> It's But and and I love what you said, be that for your family, right? Cuz when people come up and go, "My dad, I was talking to Sean, this kid, Sean Junior." He's like, "Uh, you're I'm like, "No, your dad's it, dude. Like, your dad has his own business. I ain't your dad's boss. Everybody's independent. I ain't your dad's boss. Your dad's a boss of your family." All these folks have to understand, and I want you to speak to this, please. Everybody on their team's watching them. Every freaking And by the way, nobody here is rolling their eyes talking [ __ ] about you. I promise you. Number one, they're scared you might see them from here. And number two, peer pressure, the most powerful person in the world. Somebody next to you will be like, "Dude, stop shaking your freaking head or I'll hit you and it'll keep spinning around. Guarantee it. Promise you." Talk to us about that because that's what kills me. I had a guy tell me one day, he goes, "You know why that guy's team don't grow?" I go, "No." He goes, "Dumps his [ __ ] downhill. He has a bad day. He dumps on everybody and he paralyzes them. Everybody. And I watch these people. Watch them. They're watching their moves. They're feeling their energy. Good or bad. I've been up here on stage doing these things with people that charge way too much money that are uber famous. I'd rather be shoving thumbtacks in my eyeball. It's so [ __ ] bad. Seriously. Tell help us understand. Everybody's watching. Everybody. The thing about it is you all know everybody's watching and this is the thing. So, have you have have have you guys heard of my thing called Taking Souls? >> Yeah. >> Okay. For those of you who haven't, I'm going to give you a short story. So, everybody's watching. And so, when I started figuring out what I want to be in life, I want to be a leader. I want to be the leader. Like I said, when a fire breaks out, they look at you. And what that means is this. It was Wednesday of my second hell week. We had been up the whole time. Hadn't got any sleep. And so there's about three bolt crews left, which means there's not many people left. Like over, I don't know, 80, 90 people are quit. We're down to just three boat crews. So we go into the med check and they go in, they check us out. Everybody is hypothermic. Everybody's all jacked up. and Wednesday you're a zombie. That's what the pass down. So the pass down is through years they tell you on Wednesday you're a zombie. You're walking around like this because you don't want your clothes to touch you cuz you're soaking wet. You got the ocean and you're and you're just pissing on yourself to get warm. So you you like that, didn't you? So basically what happens is you go to medcheek, they have these a crates. The a crates have your nice dry clothes in them. But what happens is the instructors are there [ __ ] putting water in them. So those dry clothes are now [ __ ] wet. And all the students are just like poopy pants. Like [ __ ] I got to put these [ __ ] wet clothes on. And they're putting them on slow and the instructors are yelling. But now the instructors know that they're zombies because that because the instructors were zombies on Wednesday. So they're giving us a little bit of leash. This goes somewhere. So this work with me for a second. So we got three boats. Boat crew one, boat crew 2, and the Smurf crew. The Smurf crew is has a smurf on the front of the boat because they're the shortest guys in the class. Smurf crew. So boat crew one. They're the tallest guys. Boat crew two, the second tallest guys and so on and so forth. There's only three boat crews up here. So, everybody gets under their boat and they're standing there with the boat on top of their head and everybody's doing this [ __ ] To answer your question, I look back, I am [ __ ] up. My feet, my hands, my neck, my whole body is just messed up. And I'm looking at like everything slowed down. I'm looking at all these people under these boats and they're just sitting there jackhammering and heads are down and the motivation is gone. And I said, "David, this is exactly where you wanted to. This is your time. This is your time. You're amongst the baddest [ __ ] in the world right now and everybody's [ __ ] up. This is my internal dialogue right now. What are you going to [ __ ] do, man? You got This is your shot, man. Man, this is your [ __ ] shot. I'm in the front of the boat crew. The front of the boat is the heaviest part of the boat. I'm looking at my boat crew and they're all just [ __ ] I want this to end, but it's not going to end till Friday. We got two more [ __ ] days of this [ __ ] So, I'm like in the front of the boat. I'm like, you know what, man? So, the instructors are at Boat Crew One. They're saying, "All right, [ __ ] Pick the boat up." And we've been picking this boat up now forever. But now, for some reason, no one can pick the [ __ ] boat up. So, here they are, and it's going back to their head. So, I'm looking at my I go, "Okay, look guys." So, I turn around, my boat crew, there's five guys behind me. I said, "Look, [ __ ] Don't be a [ __ ] punk. I want you to look at these [ __ ] instructors because they were where we were years ago under these boats. And I want them to think about they never seen a bow crew like B crew too. We are going to [ __ ] take their [ __ ] souls today. So I start to juice these mother and so you get juiced up false re false motivation becomes what? Real motivation. So now they're starting to feel the juice. So it starts come by. All right, boat crew 2. But right now, boat crew 2 has said, "Fuck it. We're gonna pick the boat up before you tell us to pick the boat up." So the boat's up. Now we're starting to boat press it. And all we're saying is you can't hurt boat crew, too. And now our boat crew puts the boat down. They let us put the boat down because we showed something that no one else had. So by us putting out more, we got a chance to rest. So, as we're resting, I turn around the B crew. It says all these [ __ ] instructors, I want to make sure from Wednesday to Friday, they cannot sleep with their [ __ ] wives because they're thinking about brok. [Applause] So to answer your question, you want to be that one [ __ ] that every day, whether it's raining, snowing, sleeping, you lost every dime, your mom died, your dad died, you come and you bring the energy that it takes to make a team function at the highest [ __ ] level every day. And that's the person you want to be every day of your life. Wow. [Applause] So, I didn't you you I mean I I I was reading your biography on all the races and I got tired just reading it. Then I read it again. But I did not know I knew early that that mission and these races runs you started that to raise money, >> right? >> Can you tell us about that? >> You want the whole story? >> Sure. You do what you want, bro. It's your stage. >> All right. So, basically how this all started for me. A lot of you may know the story, but um after I became a Navy Seal, you guys lone survivor. >> Yep. Well, Marcus Latrell is one of my best friends and so is his twin brother Morgan Latril. So, funny story about Marcus and Morgan. It's actually in my audio book, Can't Hurt Me, is that Morgan was not in the military. Marcus was in the military first. Long story short, Marcus couldn't run for [ __ ] Morgan ran one of his four mile time runs. They didn't even know it was a flop of twins and passed it for Marcus. Anyway, little inside tip. So, what happened was Marcus was on a mission, mission went bad, a bunch of guys died. I was in three hell weeks. So, damn near everybody on that op I was in hell week with. So, when I heard the news, I was in military freef fall school with Marcus's twin brother, Morgan. And I got the call telling me that I have to tell Morgan that his that Marcus was dead. Marcus was not dead. They thought he was dead. So I told Morgan they believe that Marcus is dead. They can't find him. Everybody else is dead. They can't find Marcus. They believe he's dead. Morgan looked at me and said, "He's not." I'm like, "What the [ __ ] you talking about, bro?" He was right. He wasn't dead. Four days later, Morgan calls me up. Hey, bro. They found my [ __ ] brother. Go suck it. I was like, "All right." So, at this time, I weighed 191 when I joined the military. I went to 250 after I became a Navy Seal. So, that story touched me so much that I started googling different races. I wanted to raise money for the Special Operations Warrior Foundation. It's a foundation that if your if your dad was in the military, he's a special operator, he died, your son or daughter would get full tuition to go to college. So, I'm like, I'm going to go do this. But being a Navy Seal, I couldn't do a hot dog or hamburger competition, you know, do something like that. But, so I looked up the 10 hardest races in the world, and what came up was the Bad Water 135. And me not being an ultrar runner, my workout was literally I hit the weights every day and Sunday I did the elliptical trainer for 20 [ __ ] minutes. No cardio, just that's all I did for cardio. So I Googled this [ __ ] and what came up was the Bad Water 135. So I called the race director up and said, "Hey man, I want to do this race to raise money for this foundation." He goes, "Are you an ultrarunner?" I was like, "What is that?" He's like, "You know, do you run 100 mile races or I go 100 mile races? I I didn't know this [ __ ] even existed." So, long story short, he goes, "Look, man, you got to run a 100 miles in 24 hours or less to get into the Badwater, and if you can do that, I will consider you in my race." The application process ended in January. I called the cat up in November and he said, "Well, if you really want to get in the race, there is a race in San Diego called the San Diego One Day." I call him up on a Wednesday. This race was Saturday. I had done no running. And he goes, "Okay, check it out. You get in it, you run 100 miles, 24 hours, I can see you my race." So, there's a onem track in San Diego. It was called a San Diego One Day. You want to run a onem track, see how far you can get. So I said, "Fuck it." I signed up for the race. At the time I was married. I get I go to Walmart, get a blue lawn chair. I have Rich Crackers and Milelex. That's what I have for the whole damn race. So I realize I'm going to see this chair every single one mile loop. And I'll get some Milelex and a Ritz cracker. Stupid. I had no idea the [ __ ] I was doing. But I'm going to cut to the chase. Here I am. I get to mile 70 and I never ran past 20 miles in my entire [ __ ] life. And I'm I'm in this chair at mile 70. What do you think happens to you when you are sucking on a rich cracker ball because your mouth is dehydrated, all [ __ ] up, and you're drinking Mileplex? What do you think happens to you at mile 70 being that you never trained for this and hadn't gone that far in your life? Your body starts to literally die and break down. So I'm sitting there in this chair and I have to go to the bathroom. Haven't gone to the bathroom in 12, 13 hours. The bathroom's from me to the damn wall right there. So I'm trying to get up but I can't get up. My blood pressure is all messed up. And I look over and I look at my ex-wife. I'm like, "Hey, I'm going to take a [ __ ] on myself right now because I can't get up and my blood pressure is all [ __ ] up and I'm dizzy as shit." So, I'm sitting there [ __ ] up my back and peeing blood down my leg. I got 30 [ __ ] miles to go. And this is where I'm at right now. And there's one thing a black man never wants to [ __ ] hear. She looked at me and she said, "You're starting to turn white. It's a [ __ ] long day. So, I'm sitting there. I'm looking at her and this is where the 40% rule came from. So, I'm trying to raise this money and I'm all jacked up. So, in life, you guys are going to come to a point in your life, maybe not quite this [ __ ] up, but where you don't want to go on anymore. So, what I do is I quit. I don't really quit. I let my mind know that we're going to [ __ ] bag it for the day. 70 miles in, I'm good. But I didn't quit yet. But I'm telling myself I'm going to quit. I'm sitting here in this chair. I'm like, "Okay, I can't get the [ __ ] up. I'm really messed up. I'm got [ __ ] everywhere and this is messed up." So, I'm cleaning myself up and there's an aid station that I haven't been using that has peanut butter and jelly, salt tablets, and bananas. Real food that I [ __ ] need some water and [ __ ] right now. I need something. So, I have my ex-wife bring me over some food. I'm going to sit here because I'm going to quit pretty soon, but just not yet. Let me get cleaned up first. Let me get something to eat. What this does to your mind is it takes pressure off of your brain for a second. 30 more [ __ ] miles you don't want to think about when you got [ __ ] up your back. So, I'm sitting there and I'm eating some food. I'm like, "Okay, man. My blood pressure is a little bit better. I'm going to walk to the car, but before I walk to the car, it'd be pretty badass if I can walk one mile and then I'll quit." I walked a mile. Long story short, that one mile became 30 [ __ ] miles. And that's the thing that we do a lot in life. What we do is when we have a goal, my goal was to raise money for this foundation. Now, I'm not saying go to my extent. This is all take what I say with the great just take it take little bits of what I say. You're not trying to be [ __ ] David Gogggins. You're trying to be the best you possible. But that requires knowing how to take mental breaks when [ __ ] gets hard. It's not quitting. Just take a [ __ ] break for a second. Get your breath because your mind is panicked. You're sporadic. It's called the one second decision. I saw so many people who could have graduated Navy Seal training, but they get in that [ __ ] cold water during hell week. Think about hell week. Hell week is five days, 130 hours of continuous training. You might get two hours of sleep, but you go through three to five weeks of training before you get to hell week. So all hell week is is no sleep. It's the same [ __ ] you were doing. Nothing different. But your mind spazzes the [ __ ] out hour one when they put you in that cold water that you've been in a thousand times. You get in that cold water and you freak out. You don't remember that I've been this water before a thousand times. You don't remember I've done this [ __ ] before. So in that one second decision, your mind can't process 130 hours. It's too much. So you quit. And once you quit, you take that warm shower. And guess what happens? You have regret. So you have to learn how to manage that one second decision. And what that is is this. If you do 130 hours, every second you have to win. If you lose one [ __ ] second of that 130 hours, you will not be a Navy Seal. In life, it's the same way. If you lose one second, not take a break. If you make a bad decision and just hang it up in that one second, you will [ __ ] regret it. You must win every second. You must be in control of your life every second of your life or you will lose. So that's the biggest thing. Never forget your goals. Many dreams die while suffering. Don't be one of those people whose dreams die while you're suffering. Learn to manage your mind. Wow. Unbelievable. All right, we're wrapping up. I need your help with something. We wrap up here after you. You close it out. We have a dinner break. We got an award ceremony. We give out, you know, we have 5,000 people. We probably got 500 people started to get awards. They'll be here. They're getting awards. The best thing that anybody ever did to me when I got the insurance business, the guy made me go to the awards ceremony. I've been there for four months. I said, I've been here four months. He said, I want you to go to the ceremony. I want you to see the people get the awards and I want you to realize that if they can do it, [ __ ] you definitely can do it. I want you to sit in your chair and think of what it feel like when you go achieve it. I went like he told me to and I watched and I was like, the dude just tripped over the stairs. The dude went the wrong way. The number one guy talked about himself for 45 minutes and a little dude, I'll never do that when I take that award next year because that was really egotistical. Can you help me speak life into the people that are thinking about going and getting dinner, going getting drunk, going to watch a game, and convincing them that coming back here is a great decision for their family. All right. There's a phrase I always say, and this phrase needs to stick with you for the rest of your life. There's a lot of people who want to go back, watch the game, get a drink, bag it. They want to bag the rest of the day. But the question is, are you done yet? Are you truly finished with what you came to do? And so my phrase that I've said to myself for a lot of years, and I say it in the darkest of times, don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done. So remember that. Are you done? A lot of you are not done. So don't sit back and be that bad team member because everybody's watching you and everybody's gonna know you [ __ ] bagged it. This is all part of being a [ __ ] leader. Being a leader [ __ ] sucks. You do everything in life that you do not want to do. You are unhappy 90% of your life. But that means that other people are eating because of you. They're living because of you. They're achieving because of you. So, are you really in that bad a shape? So, make a decision tonight. Do you want to be a leader or do you want to be that person who just bags it and does their own [ __ ] And then you can ask yourself that question when you go home after bagging it. Look in that dirty mirror and ask yourself one question. Do I really have what it takes to be a [ __ ] leader? I answer that question for you. No.
