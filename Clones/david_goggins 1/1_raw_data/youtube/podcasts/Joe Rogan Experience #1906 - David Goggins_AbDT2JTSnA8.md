## Transcrição

Joe  Rogan  podcast  check  it  out  The  Joe 
 Rogan  Experience  Train  by  day  Joe  Rogan 
 podcast  by  night  all 
 day  you  do  a  podcast  like  every  [ __ ] 
 day  man  pretty  much  this  week  every  day 
 [ __ ]  that  but  I  was  just  on  vacation  how 
 was  vacation  nice  little  vacations  are 
 hard  you  know  because 
 like  even  though  I  enjoy  rest  I  always 
 feel  like  I  shouldn't  be 
 always  I  get  it  you  go  on  vacations  no 
 never 
 no  nope  for  me  creatively  it's  good  it's 
 good  to  get  a  reset  cuz  I  come  back  in 
 guns  blazing  like  I  really  I  don't  I 
 don't  risk  any  mental  burnout  when  I  do 
 it  well  I  have  resets  but  my  resets  are 
 like  um  I  call  them  Aid  stations  mental 
 Aid  stations  so  when  you're  going 
 [ __ ]  hard  and  you're  grind  all  the 
 [ __ ]  time  like  everybody  knows  you're 
 24  hours  in  the  day  but  I'm  in  the 
 shower  it's  a  mental  aid  station  I  don't 
 think  about  [ __ ]  I  don't  [ __ ]  think 
 about  people  I  don't  think  about  work  I 
 don't  think  about  running  I  don't  think 
 about  working  out  I'm  in  the  car  another 
 [ __ ]  mental  aid  station  when  I'm 
 [ __ ]  eating  mental  aid  station  so 
 people  EA  and  they  work  and  all  sort 
 [ __ ]  man  so  I  I  can  grind  hard  because  a 
 lot  of  times  I'm  in  mental  [ __ ]  a 
 stations  chilling  so  you  have  little 
 mini  vacations  mini  vacations  man  all 
 day  long  all  day  long  do  you  feel  now 
 almost  a 
 responsibility  to  like  stay  at  it  all 
 the  time  cuz  so  many  people  are  watching 
 and  paying  attention  and  drawing 
 inspiration  from  you  100%  I  mean  like  I 
 probably  would  have  retired  a  long  time 
 ago  but  I  get  these  emails  from  people 
 and  it's  like  they're  living  through  me 
 like  their  strength  comes  through  what 
 they  know  I'm  doing  so  there's  so  many 
 times  I  want  to  get  up  and  say  oh  man 
 [ __ ]  it  I  got  mine  I'm  good  and  I'm  like 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  Tommy  out  there 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  Tommy  talking  about 
 tomm  in  his  email  Tommy  talking  about 
 [ __ ]  saved  his  life  man  I  ran  10 
 miles  last  night  because  of  you  man  I'm 
 like  you  know  a  lot  of  people  can  live 
 off  of  that  and  they  can  [ __ ]  be  good 
 with  that  and  you  know  a  lot  of 
 motivational  people  come  out  here  man 
 and  run  their  [ __ ]  mouths  about 
 [ __ ]  and  I  know  they  are  not  doing  [ __ ] 
 they  sit  back  and  they're  [ __ ]  like 
 you  know  they  have  their  little 
 brainstorming  sessions  about  oh  what 
 should  we  say 
 what's  going  what's  going  to  connect 
 with  people  while  they're  sing  their 
 [ __ ]  ass  my  brainstorming  sessions  is 
 [ __ ]  out  there  in  the  [ __ ]  grip  of 
 life  [ __ ]  grinding  and  that's  where 
 the  all  my  material  comes  from  the  suck 
 every  bit  of  it  comes  from  the 
 suck  and  that's  the  difference  between 
 there's  a  there's  like  a  whole  industry 
 now  that's  dedicated  to  trying  to  help 
 people  get  motivated  and  a  lot  of  the 
 people  that  are  involved  in  that  are 
 very  unqualified  100%  cuz  they're  not 
 really  doing  anything  no  there's  so  many 
 people  that  haven't  actually  done 
 anything  but  they'll  try  to  teach  you 
 how  to  get  your  life  in  order  and  how  to 
 get  your  mind  right  and  develop  that 
 Warrior  mentality  i'm  like  [ __ ]  you 
 don't  have  that  well  they're  utilizing 
 the  weakness  of  the  world  right  now  yeah 
 the  world's  in  a  very  bad  place  so  the 
 PE  these  these  people  who  are  like  K 
 artists  they  sit  back  and  say  oh  I  can 
 come  up  with  this  I  can  come  up  with 
 this  and  this  right  here  probably  make 
 me  some  money  yeah  so  they're  in  it  for 
 for  for  [ __ ]  up  reasons  this  just  not 
 a  whole  lot  of  people  like  you  you  you 
 know  I  love  that  phrase  uncommon  amongst 
 uncommon  men  cuz  it's  it's  such  a  good 
 phrase  because  it  just  shows  you  you 
 you've  been  on  this  path  for  so  long  and 
 you're  grinding  for  so  long  but  you're 
 also  honest  about  there's  moments  where 
 you  don't  want  to  [ __ ]  do  this  oh 
 which  is  why  it's  so  interesting  because 
 you  do  it  right  you  you  do  it  without 
 any  reservation  you  just  go  through  it 
 right  but  you  always  talk  about  I  don't 
 want  to  [ __ ]  do  this  [ __ ]  but  you 
 always  do  it  but  that's  what  people  need 
 to  hear  because  they  feel  like  that 
 somewhere  out  there  there's  some 
 superhuman  person  who  never  feels 
 Despair  and  doesn't  have  any  there's 
 there's 
 no  no  hesitation  so  they  feel  like 
 there's  this  person  that's  so  different 
 than  them  and  so  much  stronger  than  them 
 and  doesn't  ever  have  any 
 procrastination  and  you're  like  that's 
 not  me 
 no  I  love  that  phrase  you  told  me  once 
 he  goes  sometimes  I  look  at  my  [ __ ] 
 shoes  for  half  an  hour  AP  put  those 
 [ __ ] 
 on  it's  a  true  statement  but  but  what  I 
 do  though  man  is  I  I  came  with  this 
 thing  called  perform  without  purpose  and 
 so  many  people  they  need  to  have  a  5k  a 
 10K  I  need  to  have  a  a  a  course  in  front 
 of  me  I  need  to  have  something  in  front 
 of  me  for  me  get  my  [ __ ]  ass  up  and 
 do  some  [ __ ]  and  that  used  to  be  me  and 
 nowadays  you  know  [ __ ]  for  past  20  some 
 years  I  don't  need  [ __ ]  purpose  and 
 people  miss  out  on  this  man  the  purpose 
 we're  all  looking  for  this  golden 
 purpose  is  it  this  is  it  that  is  it 
 making  money  it  is  is  it  my  family 
 [ __ ]  the  purpose  is  you  we 
 forget  that  every  [ __ ]  day  I  wake  up 
 and  I  don't  want  to  do  some  [ __ ]  [ __ ] 
 I'm  like  okay  man  do  you  want  to  be  a 
 [ __ ]  today  do  you  want  to  feel  like  a 
 little  [ __ ]  do  you  want  to  walk  around 
 all  day  knowing  that  you  could  but  you 
 didn't  so  I  I  it's  performed  without 
 purpose  you  you  have  to  learn  how  to  get 
 up  and  do  [ __ ]  when  you  ain't  got  no 
 [ __ ]  5K  no  10K  nothing  nothing  exists 
 your  life  [ __ ]  sucks  you're  in  the 
 [ __ ]  dungeon  but  guess  what 
 [ __ ]  I'm  still  going  to  get  it 
 because  when  that  time  comes  cu  the  time 
 is  going  to  come  when  that  purpose  is 
 there  you'll  be  ready  but  most  of  us 
 [ __ ]  aren't  ready  because  we  don't 
 know  how  to  do  without  having  the  golden 
 carrot  in  front  of  us  yeah  and  so  you're 
 all  [ __ ]  there's  also  this  thing  where 
 if  you  do  it  once  it's  over  you  get  a 
 break  oh  like  that's  what  a  10K  is 
 that's  what  a  marathon  is  I'm  going  to 
 train  for  this  marathon  and  you're 
 you're  training  and  you're  training  for 
 that  big  day  but  you're  also  recognizing 
 when  that  marathon's 
 over  that's  right  that's  right  and  as 
 you  get  better  at  that  H  moment  the  all 
 moment  becomes  less  and  less  so  my  all 
 moments  now  are  like  oh  I  ran  today  I 
 went  to  the  gym  today  I  did  this  and 
 this  today  I  studied 
 today  I  have  about  eight  hours  off  in 
 those  eight  hours  are  glorious  to  me  and 
 every  day  you  go  back  out  and  you  start 
 earning  that  and  every  day  you  wake  up 
 it  sucks  and  when  it's  over  you  feel 
 better  it  sucks  you  feel  better  and  as 
 you  get  going  as  every  step  you  take  in 
 that  Journey  as  you're  like  for  me  run  I 
 run  every  day  [ __ ]  hate  it  but  every 
 step  I  take  I'm  like  all  right 
 [ __ ]  you're  beating  the  demon 
 again  you  run  every  day  but  I  don't 
 think  people  understand  how  [ __ ]  up 
 your  knees  are  no  you  you  you  run  when 
 you  sent  me  that  x-ray  after  your 
 surgery  and  I  looked  at  what  they  did  to 
 your  knee  and  and  I  looked  at  what  it 
 looks  like  right  what  the  actual  bone  on 
 bone  looks  like  and  how  it  had  distorted 
 because  there's  no  cushioning  at  all  no 
 and  the  doctor  said  to  you  I  can't  even 
 believe  you  could  [ __ ]  walk  on  these 
 knees  yeah  forget  about  run  thousands  of 
 miles  so  you're  doing  this  every  day  in 
 constant  pain  right  right  what  is  it 
 like  well  I  don't  suggest  explain  your 
 knees  first  of  all  so  okay  so  PE  people 
 think  that  my  knees  are  bad  from  a  lot 
 of  running  and  they're  wrong  I'm  I 
 wasn't  born  healthy  I  wasn't  born  with 
 some  great  body  alignment  some  great  you 
 know  I  have  sickle  cell  I  have  all  kind 
 of  [ __ ]  I  have  all  kind  of  health  issues 
 you  know  all  kind  of  I'm  I'm  [ __ ]  up 
 so  I  had  a  choice  to  make  and  the  choice 
 was  you  know  growing  up  you  know  okay 
 this  hurts  that  hurts  we  can  just  sit 
 down  and  do  nothing  or  we  can  see  how 
 far  we  can  push  the  human  body  so  on 
 that  Journey  as  I  started  getting  more 
 and  more  into  my  mind  and  start 
 realizing  that  while  what  I'm  capable  of 
 doing  my  mind  got  stronger  so  the  so  the 
 pain  in  my  knees  while  it  sucked  I've 
 been  doing  it  for  so  long  it  was  like  it 
 became  my  new  Norm  like  okay  my  knees 
 hurt  [ __ ]  it  stop  you  know  and  I  and  I 
 call  like  um  stop  feeling  sorry  for 
 yourself  but  you  sometimes  have  to 
 ignore  your  feelings  I'm  Ming  Jamie  a 
 picture  you  KNE  oh  no  do  I  I  I  think 
 Jamie  has  some  uh  do  you  have  a  picture 
 of  his  KNE  Jamie  did  I  ever  show  send  it 
 to  you 
 Jamie  I  have  it  here  hold  on  let  me  just 
 but  keep  going  no  so  it's  like  for  for 
 me  I  I  made  decision  and  my  decision  was 
 to  be  the  best  person  I  could  and  I 
 basically  a  lot  of  mornings  I  wake  up 
 and  say  [ __ ]  your 
 feelings  and  that  doesn't  mean  like  you 
 know  don't  take  it  literally  [ __ ]  your 
 feelings 
 but  sometimes  you  have  to  go  beyond  what 
 you're  feeling  and  my  knees  were  [ __ ] 
 but  guess  what  I  wanted  to  run  and  I 
 knew  that  okay  you  can  get  knee 
 Replacements  this  and  that  like  I  said 
 it  wasn't  because  of  I  Ran  too  much 
 people  always  want  to  say  oh  man  you  ran 
 so  much  so  you  [ __ ]  up  your  body  you 
 know  you  don't  want  to  be  like  David 
 Goggins  I  hear  all  the  time  you  w't  be 
 like  David  Goggins  but  so  there's  your 
 name  yeah  there  it  is  look  look  at  the 
 fact  that  there's  zero  space  between 
 those  bones  yes  sir  from  the  top  from 
 your  your  your  tibia  to  your  femur 
 there's  zero  space  it's  just 
 kneecap  covering  two  bones  that  are 
 rubbing  against  each  other  and 
 so  this  was  after  surgery  where  they  had 
 to  cut  your 
 knee  slice  your  shin  like  in  half  and 
 then  take  a  chunk  out  of  it  because  it 
 had  deformed  so  much  from  you  running 
 with  bone  on  bone  that  it  was  starting 
 to  like  swell  out  in  One  Direction  and 
 it  was  changing  the  alignment  of  your 
 leg  right  this  happened  back  in  2000 
 2001  I  was  going  through  buds  so  this 
 happened  for  a  long  this  is  this  right 
 here  has  been  going  on  for  a  long  time 
 so  and  it  got  to  a  point  where  it's  like 
 okay  I'm  done  and  that's  the  pl  that's 
 in  there  right  now  so  as  you  see  the 
 wedge  that  part  right  there  in  the  bone 
 that's  opened  up  yeah  so  they  had  to  cut 
 it  realign  it  and  then  um  now  the  uh 
 alignment  is  better  but  this  is  now 
 about  17  months  ago  17  18  months  ago 
 when  this  happened  so  couldn't  I  get 
 some  screws  that  fit  go  back  to  that 
 real  quick 
 real  the  one  sticks  right  out  of  the 
 [ __ ]  bone  hey  cut  that  [ __ ]  off  yeah 
 that  [ __ ]  down  is  that  thing  sticking 
 into  your  leg  no  I  don't  well  I  feel  the 
 plate  every  single  time  I  move  yeah  so 
 every  time  so  because  it's  like 
 connected  to  the  hamstring  so  whenever  I 
 [ __ ]  whenever  I  move  that  plate  is 
 very  irritating  so  every  step  even  like 
 when  I  walk  when  I  run  it's  just  it's  a 
 very  irritating  thing  and  then  you  got 
 to  wait  for  so  long  for  that  leg  to 
 start  getting  back  into  place  and  if  you 
 see  that  other  picture  I  sent  of  the 
 foam  my  my  foam  leg  that  I  put  my  hand 
 in  I  think  Jennifer  sent  it  to  you  Jamie 
 with  the  foam  leg  you'll  see  this  in  a 
 second  this  is  [ __ ]  up  so  like  the 
 swelling  in  that  leg  was  [ __ ]  nuts  oh 
 when  you  had  EMA  yeah  you  showed  it  to 
 me  in  Vegas  you  you  were  sticking  your 
 thumb  into  your  sh  I  grabbed  it  yeah 
 yeah  so  it  was  it  was  pretty  nuts  but  um 
 you  know  once  again  it's  just  things  you 
 uh  things  I  was  willing  to  endure  to  get 
 it  right 
 there  so  that's  just  all  post  surgery 
 swelling  yeah  so  when  the  doctor  said 
 this  to  you  and  he  he  said  look  this  is 
 how  [ __ ]  up  your  knee  is  did  he  say 
 you  need  a  replacement  what  what  was  he 
 saying  basically  I  had  two  options  so  I 
 went  to  the  first  guy  had  the  surgery 
 done  that's  in  the  book  I  talked  about 
 that  but  then  the  second  guy  so  after 
 the  first  surgery  I  was  done  so  this  is 
 the  first  surgery  after  buds  no  so  this 
 is  like  back  in  uh  looking  at  2000  so  me 
 and  Cameron  this  is  recently  so  I  didn't 
 have  any  surgery  going  through  buds 
 really  I  didn't  have  any  surgery  at  all 
 so  I  went  through  in  2001  I  [ __ ]  up  20 
 2001  whatever  it  was  I  messed  up  my  leg 
 real  bad  and  hell  we  kept  on  going  on  it 
 just  kept  on  going  kept  what  did  you  do 
 to  it  in  how  week  it  was  like  I  I  [ __ ] 
 it  up  somehow  like  running  or  whatever  I 
 Happ  it  it  can't  hurt  me  but  um  it  was 
 uh  I  think  the  boat  I  fell  it  twisted 
 but  over  a  period  of  time  it's  got  worse 
 and  worse  and  worse  so  I  was  getting 
 like  Tor  all  shots  every  day  and  then 
 just  got  worse  but  I'm  like  [ __ ]  it  I'm 
 good  so  I  kept  going  on  it  so  it  kind  of 
 healed  all  [ __ ]  up  so  this  kept  going 
 kept  going  kept  going  years  later  years 
 later  just  kept  going  on  it  so  I  stopped 
 squatting  so  it  became  like  okay  my 
 knee's  [ __ ]  up  my  align  is  messed  up 
 my  hips  are  messed  up  I  can't  squat  so 
 but  I  still  run  it's  okay  I  started 
 running  cuz  running  doesn't  require  you 
 to  bend  down  and  [ __ ]  so  I'm  running  a 
 lot  and  it  got  to  um  20  years  later 
 pretty  much  and  it  was 
 2020  or  i  g  get  this  right  camon  Haynes 
 came  down  we  went  for  a  20  mile  run  my 
 knees  were  [ __ ]  up  for  like  10  years 
 long  story  short  it  was  like  okay  man  I 
 got  to  get  this  thing  looked  at  so  when 
 got  looked  at  the  doc  was  like  oh  we  can 
 go  in  there  and  just  do  a  quick  little 
 [ __ ]  you  know  cleanup  job  and  the 
 cleanup  job  went  so  quick  guy  was 
 breaking  tools  and  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  up  like 
 literally  broke  tools  and  I  have  it  in 
 there  he  he  was  breaking  tools  I  talked 
 to  him  I  know  he  told  me  your  meniscus 
 was  the  hardest  meniscus  he's  ever 
 experienced  in  his  life  he's  like  dude 
 he  goes  I  didn't  know  that  miniscus 
 could  get  that  way  he  goes  like  he's  not 
 human  he  goes  when  I  was  cutting  into 
 meniscus  it  broke  the  scalpel  yep  Wolf's 
 lost  and  Joie  said  Wolf's  lost  something 
 yeah  yeah  he  said  normally  when  you  cut 
 in  meniscus  it  just  slices  right  through 
 like  butter  he's  like  I  couldn't  cut  it 
 yeah  might  went  butter  I  went  butter  so 
 all  those  [ __ ]  who  think  I  went 
 putting  them  100  while  weeks  go  [ __ ] 
 yourself  [ __ ]  you  don't  get  no  [ __ ] 
 like  that  baby  i  s  on  the  [ __ ]  couch 
 no  I  mean  that's  the  craziest  thing  I've 
 ever  heard  like  you've  hardened  your 
 meniscus  just  through  constant  pressure 
 and  pounding  yeah  so  he  went  in  there  to 
 clean  it  up  and  then  what  happened  so 
 basically  that  little  meniscus  that 
 whatever  the  [ __ ]  was  in  there  so  my  so 
 my  alignment  was  so  bad  the  only  thing 
 that  was  keeping  me  able  to  do  anything 
 was  that  little  [ __ ]  up  messed  up  um 
 meniscus  it  was  all  Jarred  up  and  jacked 
 up  but  the  second  that  thing  got  out 
 dude  it  was  like  I  was  have  you  seen 
 Star  Wars  those  those  storm  thing  those 
 those  those  those  big  [ __ ]  um  things 
 that  what  they  called  um  they  have 
 wobbly  legs  when  they  hit  like  logs 
 robot  things  yeah  robot  things  that's 
 how  my  leg  was  it  was  it  had  nothing  it 
 was  just  like  a  little  dangling  [ __ ] 
 like  so  from  my  knee  down  the  shin  the 
 tip  FIB  it  just  dangled  like  there  was 
 nothing  and  I  was  like  okay  man  this  so 
 was  worse  after  the  cleanup  much  worse 
 like  I  was  done  I  went  from  running  200 
 M  to  I  I  did  240  mile  race  in  in  20120 
 October  2020  it  was  Moab  went  out  there 
 got  second  place  6  2  hours  knee  was 
 [ __ ]  up  getting  it  drained  before  the 
 [ __ ]  race  but  I  still  ran  240  miles 
 literally  5  or  6  days  before  the  race 
 I'm  getting  it  drained  and  it  was  a 
 baseball  siiz  [ __ ]  um  it's  called  a 
 baker's  assist  so  they  drained  it  and  I 
 went  in  there  did  the  race  finished  it 
 and  I  was  like  okay  here  we  go  went  on 
 to  do  some  more  races  I  did  like  another 
 200  mile  did  a  couple  more  races  and 
 then  like  I  said  cam  came  down  but  after 
 that  I  went  and  got  this  surgery  done 
 and  I  went  from  running  every  day  to  now 
 I  have  some  [ __ ]  leg  that  just 
 dangles  and  after  that  surgery  it  just 
 [ __ ]  dangled  I  was  like  okay  man  I'm 
 [ __ ]  and  just  from  that  little  piece 
 of  manessa  just  that  little  piece  of 
 meniscus  and  I'm  sitting  there  thinking 
 okay  man  this  is  not  this  doesn't  make 
 any  sense  to  me  this  there's  something 
 [ __ ]  I  don't  understand  why  I  can't  I 
 can't  put  any  pressure  on  my  leg  the  the 
 amount  of  blood  they  were  taking  out  was 
 was  unbelievable  so  there's  the  blood 
 right  there  Jesus  Christ  that's  the 
 blood  dude  oh  my  god  there  one  two  three 
 four  five  you  see  the  black  blood  yeah 
 that  is  deoxygenated  blood  so  whatever 
 was  going  on  whatever  the  [ __ ]  was  going 
 on  that's  why  it  looks  different  color 
 so  the  red  blood  is  the  the  blood  that 
 has  oxygen  right  and  that  was  just  like 
 coagulated  [ __ ]  up  blood  yep  Jesus 
 yeah  so  that  so  after  surgery  I'm  like 
 I'm  like  seven  seven  days  out  or 
 whatever  the  [ __ ]  it  was  and  once  again 
 I  don't  know  the  exact  times  but  I  have 
 them  in  the  book  I  have  everything 
 [ __ ]  dialed  in  um  I  went  back  I  was 
 like  man  I'm  I'm  [ __ ]  up  I  mean  it's  a 
 simple  miniscus  surgery  man  like  people 
 go  back  a  week  later  they're  playing  two 
 weeks  three  weeks  tops  I'm  like  man  I'm 
 never  going  to  [ __ ]  run  again  I'm  G 
 to  walk  with  the  [ __ ]  limp  so  I'm 
 going  back  I'm  getting  [ __ ]  like  um 
 literally  getting  my  knee  drained  every 
 week  getting  PRP  I'm  like  man  but  in  the 
 back  of  my  mind  I  I  know  how  far  I  can 
 push  myself  I  know  my  body  so  [ __ ] 
 well  so  well  and  I'm  like  this  is  um 
 this  is  wrong  I  go  I'm  never  gonna  run 
 again 
 I'm  never  going  to  run  again  I  walk  with 
 the  limp  so  this  went  on  for  about  six 
 six  months  so  I  had  the  surgery  done  in 
 February  it  was  uh  February  March  April 
 May 
 June  about  four  months  four  months  after 
 surgery  four  or  five  months  I'm  like  hey 
 Jennifer  um  I  gotta  find  another  you 
 know  somebody  else  look  at  my  [ __ ] 
 knee  so  I  try  to  keep  my  [ __ ]  together 
 but  imagine  when  you  go  from  every  day 
 of  your  [ __ ]  life  grinding  and  you  go 
 to  nothing  mhm  like  literally  like 
 90minut  surgery  done  that's  crazy  that 
 it  was  just  a  little  meniscus  scope  90 
 minute  surgery  done  and  I  was  like  okay 
 man  this  is  anyway  so  I  found  this  guy 
 named  Dr  Gamal  out  of  New  York  and  we 
 fly  there  but  I'm  like  he  can't  fix  this 
 man  because  I  knew  it  was  a  lot  more 
 than  knes  it  was  just  it  was  all  kind  of 
 this  [ __ ]  up  body  [ __ ]  and  I  walk  in 
 the  office  and  he  decides  to  see  me  and 
 me  and  Jennifer  in  there  Jennifer's 
 happy 
 she's  happy  as  [ __ ]  it's  like  oh  my  God 
 man  this  guy's  going  to  be  able  to  get 
 you  a  a  [ __ ]  miniscus  replacement  he 
 he  was  all  kind  of  Guru  out  but  I'm  a 
 realist  bro  I  will  push  myself  and  I 
 will  go  as  far  as  I  can  but  I  also  am  a 
 realist  I  also  knew  in  the  back  of  my 
 mind  I'm  not  gonna  try  to  ruin  your 
 [ __ ]  party  Jennifer  this  what  I'm 
 saying  myself  but  this  shit's  done  it's 
 over  so  but  I  went  just  to  pretty  much 
 appease  her  and  just  see  you  know  if 
 there  anything  left  so  walk  in  the 
 office  and  the  doctor's  like  uh  yeah  I'm 
 looking  at  your  X-rays  and  that's  the 
 Doctor  Who's  like  I  don't  know  how  this 
 is  one  the  Dr  Gamal  look  him  up  world 
 renowned  [ __ ]  dude  and  when  this 
 guy  looked  at  me  straight-faced  he  said 
 man  I  don't  know  how  you  did 
 anything  with  those  knes  anything  let 
 alone  run  200  miles  back  to  back  240 
 miles  what  the  [ __ ]  you  did  I  don't  know 
 how  you  did  it  and  so  I'm  like  okay 
 whatever  can  we  get  it  fixed  and  he 
 didn't  want  to  get  get  there  cuz  he  knew 
 I  was  [ __ ]  he's  like  no  you  know  we  we 
 can  maybe  you  know  try  an  in  un  loader 
 brace  maybe  an  un  loader  brace  will  help 
 you  out  and  I  was  like  what's  an 
 unloaded  brace  so  basically  my  knee  went 
 in  on  the  miniscus  side  on  the  inside  so 
 it  was  like  jamming  in  the  inside  so 
 this  brace  kind  of  like  it  kind  of  helps 
 realign  the  knee  a  little  bit  so  then 
 you  cannot  have  so  much  pressure  on  the 
 inside  of  your  leg  so  that's  it  right 
 there  one  side  yeah  so  basically  I'm 
 like  man  I'm  like  okay  I'm  not 
 so  this  is  all  you  have  for  me  I'm  like 
 you  can't  do  [ __ ]  for  me  and  he  was  like 
 um  no  and  he  was  walking  out  of  the 
 office  and  he  could  tell  I  was  like  I 
 wasn't  too  [ __ ]  up  but  I  was  like  CU  I 
 kind  of  was  preparing  myself  for  the 
 next  part  of  my  journey  I  don't  like  to 
 lay  in  my  [ __ ]  too  long  you  I  give 
 myself  a  couple  minutes  okay 
 [ __ ]  we  gota  man  the  [ __ ]  up  we 
 gotta  get  back  in  this  [ __ ]  like 
 what's  next  you  know  let's  go  let's  go 
 see  you  know  let's  let's  go  back  to 
 college  let's  let's  do  something  because 
 you're  you're  running  and  you're  let 
 Chris  done  so  he  got  to  the  door  he 
 opened  it  and  as  he  was  literally  he  was 
 shouldered  out  the  [ __ ]  door 
 and  I'm  looking  at  Jennifer  I'm  like 
 well  you  know  we'll  go  back  to  [ __ ] 
 you  know  go  back  to  Nevada  and  [ __ ] 
 start  again  and  he  was 
 like  try  the  unloaded  brace  out  and 
 there's  one  more  thing  we  could  possibly 
 do  for  you  and  I'm  like  [ __ ] 
 like  get  your  little  monkey  [ __ ]  ass 
 back  in  here  bro  like  what  is  is  it  like 
 like  like  what  the  [ __ ]  going  on  so  he 
 was  like  yeah  there's  this  surgery 
 called 
 HTO  and  he  was  like  you  can  go  in  we  can 
 [ __ ]  you  know  pretty  much  break  your 
 tibia  it's  called  high  tibia  osteotomy 
 they  go  in  and  they  break  your  tibia 
 they  they  they  like  slice  into  it  and 
 they  they  wedge  it  to  the  point  where 
 they  realign  your  leg  back  up  it's  a 
 very  painful  surgery  it's  very  painful 
 afterwards  painful  as  [ __ ]  afterwards 
 and  they  put  that  plate  the  plate  you 
 saw  back  on  and  then  your  leg  is  so  so 
 your  knee  is  still  where  it  was  because 
 this  doesn't  get  fixed  so  it  takes 
 several  months  for  that  knee  to  start 
 working  it  way  back  into  where  that 
 alignment  is  so  now  my  leg  is  just  now 
 so  here  it  is  you  see  it  on  the  image 
 yeah  so  they  they  take  a  slice  out  of  it 
 because  it's  deformed  yep  and  that  slice 
 lowers  the  part  that's  deformed  and 
 tries  to  make  it  a  more  natural  shape 
 but  you're  still  dealing  with  bone  on 
 bone  so  you're  still  deal  you're  still 
 dealing  with  the  pain  of  arthritis 
 essentially  cuz  do  you  have  any 
 cartilage  in  your  knees  not  much  not 
 much  at  all  if  any  so  the  thing  about  it 
 it  takes  that  pressure  off  of  that  so  it 
 was  complete  bone  on  bone  right  what 
 that  surgery  does  is  it  takes  it  over  to 
 the  lateral  side  so  on  the  outside  so  I 
 I  have  a  nice  meniscus  over  there  that 
 thing  wasn't  touched  for  years  because 
 how  I  was  born  all  the  pressure  was  on 
 the  uh  my  um  medal  meniscus  so  your  knee 
 had  been  misaligned  your  whole  life 
 whole  life  that's  what  yeah  that's  my 
 whole  life  has  been  [ __ ]  up  so  my 
 Meniscus  on  my  lateral  side  is 
 pristine  so  now  the  way  he  did  it  is 
 that  all  of  my  pressure  is  going  on  to 
 that  pristine  miniscus  okay  so  now  it's 
 all  about  getting  that  leg  back  aligned 
 which  is  taken  forever  and  it's  still 
 not  aligned  it's  getting  there  it's 
 getting  there  yeah  it's  getting  there 
 cuz  M  was  so  [ __ ]  up  can  they  do  a 
 meniscus  replacement  on  you  no  so  that's 
 what  I  wanted  to  get  done  but  if  your 
 knee  is  so  far  gone  like  mine  was  there 
 was  no  option  for  that  why  is  that 
 because  my  knee  was  so  far  gone  so  it 
 would  like  when  you  put  that  meniscus  in 
 there  however  it  works  he  said  it 
 wouldn't  have  taken  it  like  basically  it 
 would  have  taken  it  but  it  would  have 
 [ __ ]  destroyed  it  because  your  leg  is 
 so  your  knee  is  so  [ __ ]  up  so  this  was 
 the  only  option  for  me  don't  they  make 
 like  an  artificial  meniscus  now  as  well 
 yep  and  this  with  this  guy  really  is 
 specializes  in  so  he's  he's  like  the  guy 
 to  go  to  for  that  stuff  what  is  an 
 artificial  meniscus  consist  of  I  guess 
 it's  just  I  have  no  idea  I'm  not  even 
 going  to  get  into  that  [ __ ]  see  if  we 
 can  find  out  what  that  is  cu  I  got  some 
 [ __ ]  up  knees  too  not  like  yours 
 though  if  I  ever  think  about  complaining 
 I  look  at  yours  yes  sir  see  world's 
 first  artificial  meniscus  available  in 
 Israel  and  there  you  go  Andreas 
 gal  yeah  there  he  is  and  so  this  it 
 looks  like  some  sort  of  a  clear  gel 
 looking  stuff  and  which  is  you  know  the 
 the  meniscus  is  just  a  cushioning  in 
 between  the  two  bones  and  the  cartilage 
 and  this  is  uh  oh  look  at  that 
 yep 
 H  and  but  they  can't  do  that  to  you  no 
 you  have  to  be  a  good  candidate  for  that 
 so  your  knee  has  to  be  in  a  certain 
 certain  condition  and  mine  was  not  in 
 that  condition  it  was  it  was  F  if  if  you 
 were  candidate  for  that  would  they  be 
 able  to  do  it  and  you  be  able  to  run  or 
 is  that  just  like  to  move  around  and 
 walk  from  what  I  read  about  you  can  you 
 can  run  you  can  do  everything  you  want 
 to  do  but  sometimes  if  you  do  a  lot  it 
 wears  it  out  so  you  but  you  could  get  a 
 new  one  get  a  new  one  yeah  that's  not 
 that  bad  not  that  bad  man  for  you  it 
 doesn't  work  no  because  basically  it 
 wouldn't  even  work  for  me  because  my 
 knee  was  gone  but  the  way  he  reshaped  it 
 wouldn't  that  correct  I  mean  he  kind  of 
 like  changed  your  alignment  of  your  knee 
 and  made  it  more  normal  I  think  it  had 
 he  made  it  more  normal  but  from  what  I 
 understand  um  if  you  put  that  in  there 
 structurally  like  like  structure-wise 
 what  what  makes  it  more  normal  is  the 
 surgery  he  did  so  right  now  there's  no 
 bone  on  bone  for  me  so  there's  no  need 
 for  that  meniscus  at  all  so  a  lot  of 
 people  get  their  meniscus  taken  out  if 
 you  have  the  right  alignment  and  your 
 body  can  do  what  it's  supposed  to  do 
 really  yeah  but  if  you  get  your  KNE  your 
 miniscus  taken  out  you're  just  cartilage 
 on  cartilage  if  you  know  um  Dwayne  Wade 
 Dwayne  basketball  player  yeah  I  believe 
 Dwayne  Wade  played  years  years  if  I'm 
 correct  with  no  meniscus  yeah  I  I  think 
 in  both  his  knees  Jesus  yeah  years  he 
 had  he  end  up  having  like  really  bad 
 knee  problems  but  his  meniscus  was 
 messed  up  back  in  the  day  they  used  to 
 take  it  out  so  if  you  look  here  here  it 
 is  was  in  college  wow  surgery  to  remove 
 the  meniscus  in  his  left  knee  11  years 
 ago  while  he  was  at  Marquette  led  to 
 ongoing  knee  problems  he's  had  with 
 Miami  Heat  I'm  so  glad  that  you  have 
 this  [ __ ]  thing  to  pull  up  Jamie 
 because  I  would  be  talking  out  my  ass 
 half  the  damn  time  that's  I  do  man  you 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  squar  me  away  brother 
 knees  are  a  problem  man  yeah  and  the 
 fact  that  you  require  your  knees  to  do 
 what  you  do  like  your  your  whole  thing 
 is  endurance  athlete  right  and  to  be  an 
 endurance  athlete  you  got  to  be  able  to 
 move  your  legs  you  got  to  be  able  to 
 move  them  but  what  I  like  about  and  this 
 was  this  was  like  literally  a  a  trained 
 skill  for  me  was  I'm  I'm  always 
 preparing  for  like  not  being  a  [ __ ] 
 like  a  lot  of  people  get  to  a  point  like 
 for  instance  like  if  Jennifer  can't  do 
 something  like  if  you  know  if  if  if  she 
 can't  go  for  a  run  or  whatever  just  like 
 cuz  she  something's  wrong  like  some 
 simple  [ __ ]  it's  G  to  bother  her  I  got 
 to  a  point  in  my  life  where  I  realize 
 this  is  life  and  so  I  move  on  past 
 things  real  quick  so  people  like  oh  my 
 God  what  are  you  gonna  do  David  if  you 
 can't  run  [ __ ]  I'll  swim  or  I'll 
 go  to  college  or  I'll  do  something  else 
 this  like  like  this  isn't  my  life  so  I'm 
 I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  very  aware  how  quick 
 life  can  take  [ __ ]  from  you  and  I've 
 always  prepared  my  mind  for  the  next 
 chapter  and  what  happened  with  me  was  I 
 started  this  thing  called  front  loading 
 so  when  I  was  young  I  used  to  be  a 
 little  piece  of  [ __ ]  you  know  like 
 [ __ ]  oh  I'm  not  good  enough  I  can't 
 do  this  I  can't  do  that  but  the  second  I 
 got  my  head  out  of  my  ass  and  I  realized 
 man  you  can  achieve  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  if  you 
 get  off  your  ass  and  you  start  moving 
 and  you  start  motivating  yourself  start 
 becoming  a  self  motivator  so  I  started 
 front  loading  and  front  loing  is  people 
 man  you've  done  so  much  by  47  because  I 
 don't  know  what  tomorrow  is  going  to 
 bring  me  so  my  my  military  resume  is  fat 
 you  know  I  [ __ ]  did  a  lot  in  the 
 military  I  did  a  lot  outside  the 
 military  I've  I've  I've  made  money  I've 
 I've  I've  done  almost  every  race  out 
 there  hard  race  in  the  world  I've  broken 
 pull-up  records  I've  done  a  lot  of  [ __ ] 
 so  when  these  bad  times  come  and  also 
 not  like  like  not  only  that  like  work 
 your  ass  off  so  so  you  can  enjoy  yeah 
 yeah  you  taking  a  shot 
 you  know  you  you  may  not  live  to  be  old 
 but  what  if  you  do  and  you  worked  your 
 ass  off  when  you  were  able  and  you  were 
 able  to  [ __ ]  get  up  early  able  to 
 grind  if  you  frontload  it  properly  the 
 back  half  of  your  [ __ ]  life  is  money 
 and  that's  what  I  did  the  second  I 
 realized  that  man  you  are  a  piece  of 
 [ __ ]  we  got  to  get  going  because  at  47 
 man  you're  not  GNA  be  able  to  do  any  of 
 this  [ __ ]  50  whatever  you  are  so  I  front 
 loaded  so  all  these  bad  things  have 
 happened  to  me  I  sit  back  man  how  are 
 you  handling  this  so  well  [ __ ] 
 i'  I've  done  it  I  front  loaded  I  have 
 the  money  I  need  I  have  the  success  I 
 need  I  have  the  [ __ ]  the  the 
 determination  the  willpower  and  also  the 
 pride  in  myself  so  when  I  wake  up  every 
 morning  I  know  who  the  [ __ ]  I  am  I 
 frontload  it  perfectly  so  I  don't  care 
 what's  taken  from 
 me  but  it's  got  to  still  there  got  to  be 
 a  strange  position  to  be  in  where  your 
 body  is  your  medium  the  body  is  the 
 vehicle  for  you  to  express  yourself 
 right  and  your  body's  breaking  down  mhm 
 and  I  know  that  they  considered  doing 
 knee  Replacements  on  you  too  yep  and 
 what  was  that  conversation  like  it  was 
 it  was  very  basic  man  it's  like  hey  you 
 know  you're  you're  not  going  to  be  able 
 to  do  some  of  the  [ __ ]  that  you've  done 
 even  though  obviously  people  are  but 
 that  was  a  conversation  and  I  know  it 
 sounds  weird  it  was  totally  fine  with  me 
 it  was  fine  because  I  had  dude  people 
 don't  understand  this  this  wasn't  like  a 
 a  part-time  job  man  when  you've  done 
 without  like  Kobe  Bryant  when  Kobe  [ __ ] 
 retired  at  last  game  he  like  60  points 
 or  some  [ __ ]  he  walked  off  the  court  he 
 didn't  [ __ ]  cry  he  said  oh  my  God  I'm 
 going  to  miss  the  sport  what  the  [ __ ]  he 
 walked  off  he  gave  he  gave  everything  he 
 could  man  when  you  [ __ ]  give  what 
 I've  given  and  [ __ ]  like  to  say 
 oh  you  [ __ ]  you  you  don't  [ __ ]  know 
 [ __ ]  which  makes  me  who  I  am  I've  given 
 everything  people  make  oh  you  you  ran  on 
 [ __ ]  up  knees  you  taped  your  feet  up 
 you  blah  blah  you  had  two  heart  surg  you 
 kept  on  going  yep  sure  did  I  had 
 somewhere  to  [ __ ]  go  I  had  somewhere 
 to  [ __ ]  go  and  I  got  there  and  Buddy 
 when  [ __ ]  tell  you  you  can  take 
 a  break  now  hey  you're  [ __ ]  up  as  long 
 as  my  knees  are  halfway  worked  I  got  to 
 run  you're  telling  me  man  may  maybe 
 chance  I  can't  run  no  more  H  give  me  an 
 excuse  to  [ __ ]  not  do  [ __ ]  but  as 
 long  as  I  have  no  excuse  I  gotta  do  it 
 but  I  I  was  I  was  happy  where  I  was  I 
 gave  everything  I  give  everything  to  who 
 I  am  and  that's  why  I'm  people  I  don't 
 believe  that  don't  don't  believe  it  I 
 gave  everything  and  when  you  give 
 everything  man  you  have  no  regret  people 
 didn't  understand  me  people  don't 
 understand  me  now  I  don't  give  a  [ __ ]  I 
 know  exactly  what  I  was  doing  I'm  not  a 
 masochist  I'm  not  crazy  I'm  not  this  and 
 that  people  try  to  title  me  and  label  me 
 no  I  had  something  to  [ __ ]  do  well 
 the  way  I  describe  it  to  people  when 
 people  ask  me  like  why  does  he  do  all 
 these  things  like  what  is  what  is  the 
 motivation  here  I  go  he's  on  a  mental 
 Journey  that  very  few  people  have  ever 
 been  on  because  the  what  people  don't 
 understand  you  they  or  they 
 misunderstand  you  or  they  purposely 
 misinterpret  the  way  you're  living  your 
 life  you're  trying  to  understand  your 
 mind  in  a  way  that  very  few  human  beings 
 ever  get  to  understand  their  mind 
 because  you're  taking  your  mind  into 
 these  terrible  Dark  Places  all  the  time 
 and  you're  trying  to  pull  things  out  of 
 that  you're  trying  to  to  learn  things 
 about  yourself  and  about  your  potential 
 from  that  that's  exactly  it  and  that's 
 what  people  don't  understand  I  studi  the 
 darkness  you  you  find  no  [ __ ]  answers 
 in  the  light  none  it's  too  happy  it's 
 too  nice  and  we're  not  we  don't  need  to 
 be  taught  how  to  live  in  happiness  that 
 that  just  comes  naturally  to  us  happy 
 moments  but  the  dark  times  man  you  can't 
 and  you  can't  get  there  unless  you  put 
 yourself  there  life  will  take  you  there 
 but  when  you  get  into  those  dark  moments 
 that's  why  people  that's  why  people  how 
 are  you  able  man  I  couldn't  [ __ ]  read 
 and  write  to  I  was  a  junior  in  high 
 school  how  are  you  able  to  write  like 
 this  man 
 [ __ ]  I  go  to  such  places  in  my 
 mind  and  I  study  the  darkness  like  it's 
 not  just  physical  when  I  was  growing  up 
 and  I  saw  my  mom  getting  beat  and  I  got 
 beat  and  I  was  some  stuttering  little 
 black  kid  in  allh  school  and  I'm  on 
 stage  and  I  gotta  say  one  line  one 
 [ __ ]  line  in  front  of  [ __ ]  15 
 people  and  I  walk  up  stage  kind  with 
 [ __ ]  stutter 
 all  those  insecurities  and  all  those 
 [ __ ]  things  man  I  used  to  go  home  and 
 [ __ ]  cry  like  my  God  man  I'm  [ __ ] 
 up  I'm  just  all  [ __ ]  up  I  I'm  hang  on 
 man  as  I  got  older  we  got  to  study  this 
 [ __ ]  man  the  only  way  we're  g  to  [ __ ] 
 get  through  this  if  we  study  it  so  every 
 time  I'm  in  a  dark  moment  and  life's 
 [ __ ]  up  around  me  whether  it  be 
 physical  or  just  life  I  get  in  it  man 
 with  a  [ __ ]  pen  and  paper  I'm  like 
 okay  this  [ __ ]  sucks  I  can  feel  like 
 I'm  [ __ ]  losing  my  [ __ ]  but  let's 
 [ __ ]  study  this  let's  come  out  of  the 
 this  [ __ ]  genius  you  know  I 
 studed  the  I  studied  the  the  the  the 
 black  matter  of  the  Mind  the  dark  matter 
 you  know  like  [ __ ]  stepen  Hawkins 
 that's  if  that's  [ __ ]  his  name  I  said 
 it  right  that  [ __ ]  studied  the 
 space  and  [ __ ]  yeah  that's  where  I 
 consider  myself  man  you  know  I  I  was  on 
 a  journey  just  like  you  said  I  mean  you 
 you  you  couldn't  have  said  any  better 
 and  so  many  people  get  it  wrong  and  I 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  man  you  can't  for  me  I 
 cannot  help  people  there's  a  lot  of 
 cookie  cutter  [ __ ]  out  here  in  this 
 world 
 discipline  wake  up  early  take  coach 
 shower  [ __ ]  this  [ __ ]  that  whatever  it's 
 all  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  it's  not  but  what 
 they  don't  teach  you  within  the  cookie 
 cutter  is  like  our  minds  are  like  a 
 [ __ ] 
 garage  and  the  garage  if  you  open  a 
 garage  and  it's  all  cluttered  up  it's 
 all  [ __ ]  up  you  can't  put  your  car  in 
 there  you  got  [ __ ]  boats  and  you  got 
 [ __ ]  kids  toys  and  [ __ ]  everywhere 
 but  if  you  organize  that  [ __ ]  garage 
 and  you  put  everything  rightful  spot  you 
 can  pull  that  car  in  there  you  can  put 
 two  cars  in  there  you  can  put  bikes  in 
 there  and  that's  like  with  the  Mind 
 people  talk  about  discipline  and  [ __ ] 
 determination  and  [ __ ]  you  know 
 repetitions  and  all  this  [ __ ] 
 consistency  why  people  fall  off  the 
 wagon  so  often  is  because  their  mind  is 
 full  of  [ __ ]  there's  no  room  in  that 
 mind  for  discipline  there's  no  room  for 
 consistency  they  may  do  it  once  or  twice 
 but  then  the  mind  takes  over  in  that 
 cluttered  [ __ ]  garage 
 comes  in  and  then  it's  like  a  circuit 
 breaker  man  a  circuit  breaker  just 
 overloads  and  it  [ __ ]  Sparks  and  our 
 minds  that's  that's  our  mind  man  it's 
 like  a  [ __ ]  circuit  breaker  that  so 
 much  [ __ ]  in  it  you  keep  on  loading  it 
 you  can't  put  any  more  into  it  so  I've  I 
 talk  about  it  in  there  man  so  much  about 
 clearing  space  in  your  [ __ ]  mind  so 
 then  you  have  room  for  all  those 
 discipline  waking  up  early  taking  those 
 because  they  they  they  do  mean  something 
 but  we  don't  get  to  that  [ __ ] 
 dark  matter  that  is  keeping  you  from 
 clearing  out  that  mental 
 garage  that's  a  good  way  to  put  it 
 because  that  is  the  mind  of  most  people 
 is  filled  with  stuff  that  they  have  to 
 move  around  to  get  to  what  they  want  and 
 it's  constantly  piling  up  and  there  [ __ ] 
 unorganized  and  organized  mind  man 
 you're  looking  at  the  [ __ ]  I  got  to 
 take  care  of  the  kids  the  kids  scals  was 
 all  [ __ ]  up  my  husband  my  my  wife  you 
 know  I'm  I  I  [ __ ]  I'm  going  by 
 McDonald's  to  get  this  and  I'm  in  my 
 schedule  everything's  just  [ __ ]  I  wish 
 I  was  doing  this  but  I'm  doing  that  and 
 that  and  this  and  I  want  a  raise  but  I 
 can't  get  one  my  boss  an  [ __ ]  where's 
 greatness  in  that  man  you  can't  you  you 
 can't  fit  discipline  into  that  you  can't 
 fit  structure  you  can't  fit  consistency 
 you  can't  fit  to  grind  and  then  when  you 
 try  it  just  gets  [ __ ]  it  gets  [ __ ] 
 overrun  by  the  [ __ ]  clutter  in  your 
 [ __ ]  up  mental  garage  when  you  are  in 
 these  dark  places  and  you're  Gathering 
 up  these 
 lessons  how  difficult  is  it  to  try  to 
 bring  that  back  and  convey  it  to  people 
 when  you're  not  in  that  space  like  when 
 you're  in  that  space  when  you're  in  the 
 Moab  240  and  you're  going  uphill  and 
 you're  in  the  middle  of  the  it's  just 
 deep  suck  right  how  do  you  convey  where 
 that  mental  fortitude  comes  from  how  do 
 you  bring  that  back  it's  almost  like 
 you've  got  something  you  can't  even  hold 
 in  your  hand  and  you  want  to  show  it  to 
 people  I  take 
 snapshots  so  every  time  I'm  in  a  bad 
 situation  like  you  know  I  I  study  it  and 
 that's  the  only  reason  I  do  have  to  [ __ ] 
 I  do  is  I'm  studying  this  [ __ ]  because  I 
 know  that  I  never  thought  I  was  G  to  be 
 writing  books  and  trying  to  help  people 
 get  better  but  I'm  I  was  always  trying 
 to  do  it  because  I  knew  I 
 sucked  and  so  when  you  know  you're 
 trying  to  get  somewhere  you  know  you 
 suck  you  know  that  you  you  believe  that 
 you're  a  born 
 loser  you  are  taking  snapshots  man  like 
 you  know  you  you  see  something  on  your 
 phone  like  oh  man  I'm  going  to  take  a 
 [ __ ]  snapshot  of  that  or  how  you  do 
 the  little  picture  [ __ ]  so  you  can  save 
 it  on  your  phone  I  do  that  in  my  mind  so 
 I  get  in  these  moments  I'm  like  [ __ ] 
 okay  wow  that's  some  [ __ ]  good 
 knowledge  right  there  man  I  snapshot  it 
 because  I  know  that  I  can  use  that  later 
 I  can  I  can  I  can  use  this  because  I'm 
 not  out  there  just  I'm  not  most  people 
 they  go  out  and  they  run  and  they  go  out 
 and  they  do  and  they're  like  oh  this  is 
 beautiful  look  at  the  [ __ ]  Mountains 
 and  the  [ __ ]  and  all  this  [ __ ]  no  I 
 don't  like  it  my  body  hurts  I'm  hurting 
 how  do  we  get  through  this  and  it's  a 
 [ __ ]  it's  a  it's  it's  a  lab  it's  my 
 mental  lab  and  I  and  so  when  I  come  home 
 I'm  not  forgetting  it  and  the  second  I 
 every  day  I  get  done  running  every  day  I 
 get  through  work  and  every  day  I  get 
 through  studying  whatever  it  is  that 
 brings  me  to  that  place  of  knowledge  I 
 come  home  and  that  book  was  mostly 
 written  on  scratched  piece  of  paper  in 
 hand  so  I  come  home  from  from  running 
 and  I  write  everything  out  I  write 
 everything  out  all  those  things  and  as 
 I'm  running  I'm  talking  about  it  so  all 
 these  things  that  pop  my  head  as  I 
 continue  to  run  I'm  going  through  it  I'm 
 I'm  starting  to  layer  it  down  I'm 
 starting  to  break  it  down  into  okay  that 
 happened  okay  now  now  let's  layer  this 
 because  that's  just  not  how  it  happened 
 it  just  didn't  happen  that  way  what  led 
 up  to  this  and  so  it  becomes  Me  by 
 myself  in  school  I'm  literally  going  to 
 school  right  now  and  I'm  learning  so 
 when  I  come  home  I  write  it  out  and  and 
 then  I'm  able  to  write  out  and  I'm  able 
 to  think  about  it  and  say  okay  oh  this 
 is  good  [ __ ]  this  is  this  will  help  me 
 later  on  and  then  it  becomes  what  it  is 
 now  and  when  you  try  to  convey  it  to 
 people  what  what  do  you  when  when  you're 
 writing  it  out  and  when  you're  talking 
 about  it  like  what  are  you  thinking  are 
 you  thinking  that  this  is  going  to  get 
 into  someone's  mind  and  this  is  going  to 
 help  them  motivate  themselves  are  you 
 just  trying  to  express  yourself  and  let 
 them  do  with  it  what  they 
 can  I'm  them  you're  them  I'm  them  I  and 
 the  [ __ ]  up  thing  about  me  why  I'm 
 able  to  do  it  the  way  I'm  able  to  do  it 
 I'm  not  above  them  I  was  never  above 
 them  a  lot  of  people  write  where  they 
 are  they  write  where  they  are  oh  yeah 
 like  [ __ ]  you  right  now  writing  you 
 have  a  good  life  man  you  have  a  [ __ ] 
 good  life  I  don't  write  from  that  place 
 I  write  from  the  place  that  I  am  the  the 
 the  the  the  place  that  created  who  I  am 
 I  go  back  to  that  place  I  call  going 
 back  to  scratch 
 I  can't  write  about  David  goggin  now 
 David  goggin  now  is  a 
 success  people  want  to  get  to  be  to  feel 
 whatever  success  is  for  them  they  want 
 to  feel  that  so  I  can't  write  it  here  at 
 David  goggin  successful  I  must  write  at 
 David  gogin  [ __ ]  man  I'm  a  [ __ ]  I 
 don't  feel  good  about  myself  and  every 
 day  I  go  through  that  Journey  so  that's 
 where  it  comes  from  it  comes  from 
 scratch  all  that  [ __ ]  all  my  knowledge 
 comes  from  going  back  to  where  the  real 
 growth  growth  doesn't  happen  when  you 
 make  it  so  far  in  life  you  make  it  so 
 high  up  the  whatever  it  is  whatever 
 you're  trying  to  be  there's  no  more 
 growth  there's  small  growth  but  you 
 remember  back  when  you  [ __ ]  tried  to 
 become  Joe  Rogan  you  are  now  how  much 
 growth  was  in  that  tons  of  growth 
 learning  lessons  learn  so  I  go  I  always 
 RIS  that's  why  I'm  a  [ __ ]  wildland 
 firefighter  now  wh  why  I'm  a  [ __ ] 
 smoke  jumper  I  don't  need  to  do  that 
 [ __ ]  at  all  but  I  don't  learn  learn 
 anything  from  where  I'm  at  now  there's 
 no  knowledge  up  here  the  knowledge  is 
 down  there  in  the  [ __ ]  muck  so  that's 
 where  I  write  that's  where  I  go  back 
 that's  where  I  learn  I  always  go  back  to 
 school  always  go  back  to  the  basics  I 
 always  go  back  to  first 
 grade  and  how  much  of  that  is  tied  to 
 doing  things  physically  though  there's 
 like  there's  a  there's  a  certain  kind  of 
 physical  struggle  that  you  go  through 
 particularly  with  what  you  excel  at 
 which  is  endurance  athlete  work  when 
 when  there's  a  mental  and  physical  thing 
 that  happens  when  the  two  of  them  are 
 together  it  doesn't  happen  in  anything 
 else  like  you  can  do  hard  work  hard 
 mental  work  and  it's  very  difficult  and 
 I'm  sure  you  can  learn  a  lot  from  that 
 right  but  it  doesn't  have  the  physical 
 pain  that  comes  with  the  suck  of 
 endurance  work  yes  there's  nothing 
 nothing  in  the  world  that  you're  able 
 I'm  able  to  get  let's  say  I  that  Moab 
 240  I  was  in  62  hours 
 [ __ ]  sucked  it's  just  with  blown  out 
 knees  blown  out  knees  literally  the  a 
 few  days  before  the  race  I'm  getting 
 them  drained  Before  the  Race  so  that's 
 in  your  [ __ ]  mind  man  like  it  ain't 
 like  oh  I  show  up  to  start  like  oh  this 
 is  [ __ ]  great  I'm  gonna  [ __ ]  have 
 a  good  time  out  here  no  I'm  thinking  all 
 right  let's  have  my  [ __ ]  knees 
 drained  like  I'm  I'm  in  pain  at  Mile 
 zero  and  that's  in  your  brain  I  have  240 
 miles  of  [ __ ]  ahead  of  me  and  there's 
 nothing  in  life  nothing  in  life  this  is 
 why  I  love  Endurance  Sports  so  much  I 
 love  it  and  I  hate  it  it's  LoveHate 
 relationship  62 
 hours  I  equate  that  to  [ __ ]  seven 
 years  of 
 life  you  can't  get  that  man  so  what  I 
 know  that  Ultra  does  for  me  is  it  packs 
 in  it  packs  in  I  can't  I  can't  live 
 several 
 lifetimes  I  can't  see  because  the 
 knowledge  I  need  to  gain  for  this  life  I 
 live  in  today  I  need  two  or  three  or 
 four  lifetimes  to  be  where  I  want  to  go 
 Ultra  gives  it  to  me  in  [ __ ]  high 
 definition  real  fast  62  hours  you  go  out 
 there  [ __ ]  suffer  you  come  back  oh 
 that  was  62  hours  I  gained  seven  [ __ ] 
 years  of  knowledge  the  ups  and  downs  the 
 pain  The  Suffering  The  the  you  you  learn 
 how  to  chunk  the  [ __ ]  down  like  oh  my 
 God  man  I'm  at  Mile  100  how  the  [ __ ]  am 
 I  get  toor 
 118  everything  becomes  you  you  start  to 
 learn  Life  out  there  and  you  learn  so 
 much  in  such  a  condens  period  of  time 
 and  nothing  in  the  world  can  do  it  like 
 pushing  yourself  to  the  absolute  limit  I 
 I  I  caught  like 
 so  people  have  talent  people  have  a  lot 
 of 
 talent  and  this  is  going  beyond  your 
 talent  so  when  Talent  when  there's  no 
 more  Talent  what  happens  happens  to  you 
 most  people 
 quit  people  only  go  to  their  talent 
 level  and  once  their  talent  level  is 
 gone  it  becomes  a  mental  game  that  that 
 whole  mental  game  sets  in  then  and  most 
 people  can  only  perform  to  their  talent 
 and  they  realize  man  why  am  I  always 
 messing  up  right  here  why  why  why  is 
 this  like  my  big  my  big  hurdle  it's 
 because  you're  performing  to  your 
 talent  and  then  after  that  your  mind  has 
 nothing  for 
 you  nothing  for  you  I  see  I  see  Fighters 
 I  see  Runners  I  see  people  who  they're 
 great  but  they  get  to  the  edge  of  their 
 talent  it's  like  [ __ ]  man  what  what's 
 what's  up  because  you're  now  at  the 
 point  now  where  you're  talented  could  do 
 [ __ ]  for  you  my 
 friend  now  it's  the  mental 
 game  and  that's  where  people  get  lost  in 
 life  get  lost  in  that  next  level  and 
 that  next  level  is  found  for  me  in  the 
 things  that  I  do  just  misunderstood 
 that's  a  giant  problem  with  Fighters  yep 
 there's  many  fighters  that  are  Elite 
 level  in  the  gym  but  when  they  get  tired 
 and  when  they  get  pushed  and  when  they 
 get  into  that  there's  a  when  the  world 
 starts  narrowing  and  the  walls  start 
 closing  in  and  they  can't  see 
 peripherally  anymore  Y  and  they're 
 exhausted  and  they  start  making  mistakes 
 so  all  of  their  understanding  of  what  to 
 do  next  gets  clapped  outed  because 
 they're  thinking  about  quitting  they're 
 thinking  about  being  exhausted  when  am  I 
 going  to  get  a  break  how  much  do  I  have 
 left  in  a  tank  can  I  even  push  forward 
 here  or  will  I  gas  out  and  risk  getting 
 stopped  and  that  is  exactly  what  you 
 said  goes  on  into  the  human  mind  yeah 
 when  Talent  when  you  have  a  talent 
 problem  yeah  it's  exactly  what  goes  on 
 your  mind  so  how  are  you  going  to 
 [ __ ]  defeat  that  bro  you're  sitting 
 there  getting  beat  the  [ __ ]  down  by  a 
 [ __ ]  just  on  you  [ __ ]  just 
 going  you  down  take  down  take  down  take 
 down  hit  in  the  face  hit  in  the  face  and 
 all  it's  going  through  your  mind  is  what 
 you  just  [ __ ]  said  there's  no 
 positivity  in  that  but  when  you  train 
 the  mind  the  way  I  train  mine  [ __ ] 
 ready  man  [ __ ]  ready  because  first  of 
 all  I  didn't  have  much  talent  so  I  had 
 to  train  one  [ __ ]  thing  you  better 
 train  your  [ __ ]  mind  because  my 
 talents  going  to  run  out  way  early  when 
 [ __ ]  got  hard  for  me  back  in  the  day  bro 
 I'm  done  I'm  out  see  you  okay  I  got  to 
 invent  a  [ __ ]  that  can  so  I 
 invented  goggin  I  invented  a 
 [ __ ]  that  that  that  realized 
 we're  not  good  enough  but  gogins 
 realizes  we're  mentally  strong  as  [ __ ] 
 and  we're  going  to  outstrength  these 
 [ __ ]  in  the  mind  there's  a  big 
 um  there's  an  understanding  in  fighting 
 that  sometimes 
 Talent  is  a  curse  because  some  people 
 are  very  talented  and  they  just  don't 
 work  as  hard  you  know  uh  khabib  Nur  off 
 talks  about  that  and  he's  one  of  the 
 greatest  mixed  martial  arts  fighters  of 
 all  time  one  of  the  rare  guys  to  retire 
 undefeated  but  he's  like  talented  guys 
 don't  work  hard  enough  no  he's  like 
 talented  guys  the  problem  with  talented 
 guys  is  they  can  get  by  early  they're 
 they're  like  faster  than  people  maybe 
 they  just  have  a  better  understanding  or 
 better  coordination  some  people  just  you 
 know  we're  not  even  like  people  are  not 
 even  in  their  abilities  when  it  comes  to 
 sports  some  people  are  just  very  gifted 
 yes  but  gifted  fighters  in  particular 
 they  just  there's  something  about  it 
 where  a  lot  of  them  never  realize  their 
 full  potential  no  because  they  don't 
 develop  that  mental  game  that  you're 
 talking  about  they  don't  have  to  because 
 they  could  piece  people  up  on  the 
 outside  they  win  fights  easy  they  stop  a 
 bunch  of  people  in  the  first  round  they 
 look  like  a  hero  but  then  when  someone 
 comes  along  that  can  survive  that  first 
 round  and  then  start  dragging  him  into 
 hell  that's  right  oh  and  you  see  and 
 that's  you  said  you  drag  a  [ __ ] 
 into  hell  who's  a  [ __ ]  who's  a  demon 
 yeah  you're  in  the  long  for  a  long  race 
 and  and  they're  hard  people  with  a 
 talent  problem  who  are  so  talented 
 they're  hard  to  train  they're  hard  to 
 push  if  if  if  you're  their  coach  and  you 
 trying  to  get  them  to  see  that  we  got  to 
 get  you  past  this  Talent  problem  we  got 
 we  got  to  get  you  to  the  point  where 
 you're  into  that  mental  Zone  because  we 
 got  to  get  you  way  past  your  talent  and 
 it's  it's  hard  for  coaches  to  take  these 
 these  f  or  whoever  past  their  talent  and 
 on  the  other  side  is  that  is  where  they 
 gain  true  true  levels  the  the  the  levels 
 Beyond  talent  that  that's  where  it 
 really  is  because  if  you're  able  to  take 
 a  [ __ ]  down  to  Deep 
 End  while  [ __ ]  just  putting  his 
 toe  in  feeling  the  water  and  [ __ ]  if  it 
 my  first  in  the  deep  end  he  would  take 
 you  down  there  and  he's  mentally  strong 
 it's  over  it's  over  man  they  because 
 they  because  they  live  in  the  deep  end 
 they  live  in  it  man  they  thrive  in  it 
 you  it's  almost  like  you  have  to  have 
 the  ability  to  go  to  the  deep  end  no 
 matter  whether  or  not  you'll  ever  go 
 there  right  yes  and  some  people  are  like 
 well  I'm  never  going  to  go  to  the  deep 
 end  but  you  should  be  able  to  yes  100% 
 you  have  to  be  trained  to  do  it  you  have 
 to  be  trained  for  it  for  that  time  comes 
 you're  like  okay  I'm  deep  in  qualified 
 yeah  I  am  deep  in  [ __ ]  qualified  I 
 got  my  [ __ ]  deep  in  certification  but 
 you  know  what's  interesting  about  this 
 book  is  you  talk  about  how  there  was 
 moments  even  though  you're  clearly  deep 
 end  qualified  clearly  deep  end  certified 
 yes  sir  you  took  some  time  and  you 
 hadn't  been  a  deep  end  for  a  while  and 
 you  like  I'm  kind  of  a  part-time  Savage 
 now  right  this  is  kind  of  [ __ ]  and 
 you're  recognizing  it  in  yourself  even 
 though  you  know  your  ability  you  know 
 your  history  you  know  what  you've  been 
 capable  of  doing  in  the  past  you're  like 
 but  I  haven't  been  there  nope  I  haven't 
 been  there  in  a  while  and  you  had  to  go 
 back  what's  funny  about  that  part-time 
 Savage  thing  in  there  man  where  I 
 [ __ ]  totally  dogged  myself  because 
 the  truth  um  all  this  became  nice 
 waking  up 
 [ __ ]  bakon  in  eggs  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  protein  shake  early  morning 
 [ __ ]  and  I  stopped  having  those  hard 
 conversations  with 
 myself  boy  my  whole  life  that's  why 
 motherfu  hate  my  ass  boy  because  I'm 
 hard  on  me  if  I'm  hard  on  me  I  don't 
 give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  I  don't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  about  what  you  think  I  don't  give  a 
 [ __ ]  you  think  about  me  nothing  else 
 hard  on  myself  bro  every  morning  I  woke 
 up  all  right  [ __ ]  I  call  my 
 morning  meeting 
 my  morning  me  we  all  have  these  [ __ ] 
 meetings  all  [ __ ]  day  long  you  know 
 we  go  to  work  we're  we're  working  for 
 somebody  else  they  want  a  meeting 
 because  they  want  to  be  successful  so  we 
 all  sit  our  ass  down  try  to  make  them 
 better  try  to  make  them  more  money  try 
 to  make  them  more  powerful  we  don't  do 
 that  for  ourselves  so  every  morning  I 
 wake  up  I  used  to  I  I  had  to  get  back 
 into  it  again  because  in  that  chapter 
 you  see  I  became  a  little  [ __ ]  that 
 morning  meeting  I  wake  up  okay  goggin 
 what  did  you  do  [ __ ]  up  yesterday 
 where  were  you  at  and  I  go  through  and 
 analyze  my  life  and  then  went  through  a 
 period  of  time  there  man  where  I  stopped 
 having  those  conversations  you  know  how 
 you  let's  say  you  and  your  wife  go  out 
 let's  say  I  don't  I  don't  know  just  make 
 up  a  story  here  you  and  your  wife  go  out 
 and  you  see  your  cousin  and  your 
 cousin's  fat  as  [ __ ]  I  don't  know  I 
 don't  know  they  are  not  hopefully  not  if 
 they  are  apologize  maybe  so  they  go  out 
 and  you  see  your  cousin  she's  fat  as 
 [ __ ]  he's  fat  as  [ __ ]  whoever 
 and  you  guys  get  back  in  the  car  and  you 
 guys  man  you  see  [ __ ]  Mary  Joe 
 how  that  she  was  that's  what  we  do  we  go 
 back  in  the  hard  conversation  that  you 
 should  be  having  with  Mary  Joel  hey  Mary 
 Joel  you  [ __ ]  gained  some  weight  huh 
 sister  [ __ ]  kind  of  big  that's  what  I 
 do  to  myself  a  lot  of  people  that  we  see 
 all  day  long  we  see  them  you  don't  have 
 the  hard  conversation  with  we  we  walk 
 around  I  rather  you  [ __ ]  hate  me  and 
 get  better  than  like  me  and  stay  the 
 same  and  that's  how  I  feel  about  David 
 Goggins  [ __ ]  I  rather  me  hate  I 
 hating  you  David  man  I  hate  you  David 
 but  I  get  better  from  it  I  get  better 
 from  it  and  that's  why  when  people  see 
 me  and  I  know  you  you're  you're  in  my 
 little  Foxhole  if  you're  in  my  Foxhole 
 and  you  become  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  hey  come 
 here  brother  let  me  talk  to  you  real 
 quick  Brother  people  don't  like  that 
 [ __ ]  man  but  I'm  not  going  to  allow  you 
 to  go  to  a  place  that's  going  to  be  hard 
 to  get  out  of  it's  G  to  be  hard  if  I 
 allow  you  gain  five  more  pounds  or  allow 
 you  take  four  more  days  off  of  school  or 
 like  to  keep  on  procrastinating  in  your 
 [ __ ]  life  and  I  see  and  I  tell 
 Jennifer  behind  your  back  I'm  doing  you 
 no  [ __ ]  Justice  zero  justice  so  where 
 this  world  is  now  you  can't  say  a 
 [ __ ]  thing  I  do  I  still  do  and 
 I  always  will  don't  like  me  don't  like 
 me  I'm  good  with  that  that's  exactly 
 what's  going  on  with  like  fat  models 
 that's  it  I'm  proud  like  you're 
 beautiful  no  matter  what  but  that's  not 
 true  and  the  thing  about  it  is  I  have  no 
 problem  if  you  want  to  be  fat  I  have  no 
 problem  with  anybody  if  you  want  to  be 
 whatever  the  [ __ ]  you  want  to  be  but 
 make  sure  you  [ __ ]  if  you're  fat 
 [ __ ]  go  go  be  fat  go  be  real 
 [ __ ]  fat  but  let's  be  real  nobody 
 wants  to  be  fat  nobody  does  that's  why  I 
 said  it  man  nobody  does  that's  not  true 
 they  will  pretend  I'm  fine  with  it  but 
 if  I  could  give  you  a  button  that  you 
 could  push  and  boink  be  skinny  all  of  a 
 sudden  you'd  have  this  incredible  body 
 take  everybody  would  push  that  button 
 but  what  happens  is  man  we  get  in  this 
 world  where  it  gets  hard  yeah 
 and  so  the  harder  it  is  the  more  you 
 start  to  push 
 back  and  the  more  you  push  back  and  then 
 it's  not  right  for  people  to  talk  about 
 it's  not  right  for  like  let's  say  you 
 are  fat  I  was  fat  that's  why  I  talk 
 about  it  go  ahead  and  say  something 
 [ __ ]  I  was  fat  too  and  it  was 
 hard  as  [ __ ]  every  [ __ ]  day  to  get  up 
 I  know  what  it  feels  like  when  you  roll 
 your  fat  ass  out  of  bed  and  all  you  want 
 is  some  [ __ ]  damn  cinnamon  buns  and 
 [ __ ]  and  [ __ ]  CH  chocolate  milkshakes 
 I  I  know  what  it  is  I  know  exactly  what 
 it  is  but  I  can't  want  it  more  than  you 
 and  so  many  people  just  want  it  the  easy 
 way  it  I'm  sorry  man  it's  not  so  what 
 they  start  to  do  is  they  build  this 
 Narrative  of  it's  okay  when  the 
 narrative  should  be  you  need  to  [ __ ] 
 work  harder  you  need  to  [ __ ] 
 discipline  your  mind  better  we  need  to 
 help  people  more  than  just  saying  it's 
 okay  it's  okay  that  you're  not  [ __ ] 
 willing  to  [ __ ]  help  yourself  out 
 that's  not  not  okay  it's  not  okay  it's 
 not  acceptable  even  though  it's  your 
 life  if  that's  if  if  that's  acceptable 
 that's  unacceptable  and  there's  a  lot  of 
 people  in  this  world  me  included  that  if 
 I  accepted  that  I  wouldn't  be  anywhere 
 so  yeah  a  lot  of  people  just  [ __ ] 
 they  they  start  creating  a  narrative 
 about  themselves  that  make  it  okay  the 
 ultimate  get  out  jail  free  card  and  now 
 the  world  is  set  up  to  have  so  many  gel 
 free  cards  everything  is  okay  and  you 
 can't  say  a  [ __ ]  thing  about  it 
 this  is  what  it's  interesting  though  is 
 that  when  you're  talking  about  how  you 
 had  to  come  to  this  realization  that 
 You'  become  a  part-time  Savage  this  is 
 recently  yeah  that's  uh  you're  looking 
 at 
 200 
 no  2018  yeah  yeah  2018  not  that  long  ago 
 no  [ __ ]  no  yeah  so  even  though  you've 
 been  through  all  those  things  and  you 
 have  all  this  information  in  your  head 
 it's  like  there's  no  rest  no  you  never 
 get  a  chance  and  if  you  do  take  a  little 
 time  and  start  enjoying  it  all  of  a 
 sudden  that  General  in  the  back  of  your 
 head  is  like  hey  hey  look  what  you're 
 doing  exactly  you're  being  a  little 
 [ __ ]  and  so  in  your  mind  you  had  gotten 
 soft  oh  100%  And  my  softness  was  still 
 two  days  so  if  you  look  in  there  two  a 
 days  was  you  being  soft  my  part-time 
 Savage  was  me  running  like  50  miles  a 
 week  me  [ __ ]  not  you  know  because 
 what  what  I  used  to  do  and  what  I  do  now 
 is  I  got  to  a  point  I  be  running  I  was 
 like  okay  man  we  could  do  10  miles  today 
 I  get  I  get  to  10  miles  like  oh  no 
 [ __ ]  that  [ __ ]  demon  that  I 
 let  out  every  [ __ ]  morning  that  walks 
 the  streets  at  night  he  comes  say  no 
 [ __ ]  not  today  man  there's  somebody  out 
 there  that  you  don't  know  have  never 
 [ __ ]  met  in  your  entire  life  that  is 
 doing  12  13  14  going  to  do  another  one 
 and  when  you  meet 
 him  you  ain't  gonna  be  [ __ ]  ready  so 
 goggin  kept  on  running  so  you  talk  about 
 that  and  uh  you  talk  about  how  cam  came 
 to  visit  you  in  Vegas  and  gave  you  a 
 spot  check  oh  yeah  oh  yeah  I'm  always 
 ready  for  a  [ __ ]  like  cam  I'm 
 always  ready  for  a  mother  like  cam  so 
 out  of  nowhere  dude  this  guy  calls  me 
 literally  and  this  is  one  thing  about 
 life  this  is  why  you  always  must  be 
 ready  always  be  ready  never  get  ready 
 people  go  oh  hey  what  do  you  training 
 for  David  I  ain't  training  for  [ __ ]  when 
 something  pops  up  I'll  be  [ __ ]  ready 
 so  when  Cam  Pop  the  [ __ ]  up  and  cam 
 calls  hey  man  I'm  going  to  be  in  uh  Las 
 Vegas  you  want  to  go  for  a 
 run  sure  do  sure  do  brother  sure  do 
 while  the  Run  sucked  I  was  ready  well 
 you  guys  were  doing  like  six  minute 
 miles  for  like  26  miles  it  was  Brut  it 
 was  20  miles  and  Jennifer  was  with  us 
 and  so  Jennifer  can  run  her  [ __ ]  ass 
 off  she's  fast  as  [ __ ]  so  we  went  out 
 but  she's  not  a  six-minute  mile  Runner 
 so  we  went  out  for  the  first  first  10 
 and  Jennifer  is  with  us  she  was  with  us 
 for  the  first  seven  she  turned  around  I 
 think  she  did  like  15  miles  so  me  and 
 Cam  went  out  after  we  left  Jennifer  she 
 went  back  for  another  three  to  go  out 
 and  get  10  and  come  back  10  but  my  whole 
 idea  was  I  know  the  course  [ __ ]  I'm 
 about  to  drop  your  [ __ ]  ass 
 [ __ ]  so  we  go  out  cause  because 
 going  out  is  a  little  bit  um  as  old  I 
 think  it  was  a  little  bit  uphill  no  a 
 little  bit  downhill  a  little  bit 
 downhill  so  a  little  bit  downhill  so  we 
 turn  around  10  Mile  Mark  come  back  and  I 
 could  tell  Cam  was  hurting  boy  but  Cam's 
 a  prideful  [ __ ]  dude  prideful 
 [ __ ]  love  that  dude  so  we  get  to 
 about  mile  16  17  and  I  could  tell  now  he 
 kind  of  comes  off  my  shoulder  slightly 
 and  I'm  like  oh  [ __ ]  in  the  armor  I 
 feel  it  you  know  you  eyes  kind  looking 
 at  you  know  out  you  know  out  of  your 
 prip  vision  but  I'm  like  this  is  a 
 prideful  [ __ ]  man  and  keep  on 
 going  man  holding  sixes  we  gets  about 
 mile  18  I  look  Cam's  right  back  on  the 
 shoulder  I  just  smiled  I  said  you  are 
 exactly  who  the  [ __ ]  I  thought  you  were 
 a  [ __ ]  and  so  we  went  out  tested 
 each  other  man  good  day  went  to  the  gym 
 worked  out  hard  went  and  got  some  steak 
 same  day  same  oh  we  [ __ ]  worked  it 
 out  dude  whenever  meet  him  together  you 
 can  guarantee  it's  G  to  be  two  people 
 that  love  each  other  but  are  waiting  for 
 the  other  [ __ ]  to  break 
 100%  dude  it's  like  this  thing  in  the 
 back  of  her  head  okay  maybe  this  will 
 break  them  maybe  this  will  break  him  so 
 we  haven't  broken  each  other  yet  but  I'm 
 sure  the  day  will  come  so  so  you  run  20 
 miles  and  then  you  lift  weights  but  see 
 lifting  weights  people  like  people  don't 
 get  it  man  it's  not  like  lifting  weights 
 it's  like  you  know  we  go  and  do  like  so 
 many  reps  like  people  go  oh  you're  only 
 doing  um  was  like  90  some  pounds  on  the 
 incline  [ __ ]  do  five  sets  of  2 
 five  with  a  super  set  of  push-ups  super 
 set  of  curls  super  set  of  pull-ups  super 
 set  of  triceps  super  set  of  what  the 
 [ __ ]  else  was  I  forget  it's  a  super  set 
 man  so  we're  going  through  lifting 
 lightweight  but  for  massive  massive 
 amounts  of  reps  and  so  you're  like 
 totally  swollen  and  like  it's  just  the 
 some  some  of  the  best  workouts  in  the 
 world  between  me  and  him  some  of  the 
 best  workouts  in  the  world  man  and  then 
 you  had  steak  and  then  we  had  steak 
 that's  right  then  and  then  I  treat  can 
 to  a  steak  right  and  that's  a  mental  aid 
 station  mental  oh  yes  mental  Aid 
 stations  baby  I  think  one  of  the  most 
 important  parts  about  the  way  you 
 express  yourself  in  your  books  is  that 
 you  do  talk  about  your  weaknesses  and 
 you  you  do  talk  about  your  past  and  how 
 you  started  off  on  this  journey  and  you 
 talk  about  how  there  are  those  moments 
 that  you  doubt  oh  yeah  and  you  but  you 
 still  go  oh  yeah  sometimes  like  you  know 
 I  call  it  uh  you  got  call  an  audible  you 
 know  the  line  of  scrimmage  man  like  some 
 of  the  great 
 quarterbacks  they'll  be  at  the  line  of 
 scrimmage  and  they'll  look  at  the 
 defense  the  defense  is  oh  [ __ ]  defense 
 is  Shifting  then  he  calling  audible  in 
 my  mind  a  lot  of  times  man  I'm  like  it 
 doesn't  mean  I  quit  I  don't  quit  you 
 know  I  may  not  make  it  the  first  time 
 but  I'll  come  back  I  gota  call  an 
 audible  I  gotta  [ __ ]  I  gotta  I  gotta 
 [ __ ]  get  my  head  back  in  the  game  I 
 gotta  I  gotta  figure  this  [ __ ]  out  it 
 doesn't  mean  you  leave  it  means  you 
 study  it  more  it  means  you  study  it  more 
 and  and  whenever  I  feel  at  something 
 people  I  say  man  how  do  you  handle 
 failure  man  I  fail  a  lot  dude  I  fail  all 
 the  [ __ ]  time  they  go  how  do  you 
 handle  it  what  I'm  trying  to  do  and  this 
 isn't  being  arrogant  man  I  I  it's  being 
 real  not  many  people  are  trying  to  do  so 
 there's  not  many  people  that  who  who  can 
 even  open  their  [ __ ]  mouth  and 
 criticize  me  when  I  do  fail  because  I'm 
 on  I'm  I'm  I'm  trying  to  do  [ __ ]  man 
 that  many  people  aren't  trying  to  do  but 
 I  don't  look  at  failure  as  failure  I 
 look  at  failure  as  your  first  second 
 third  fourth  fifth  attempt  I  look  at 
 them  as  attempts  I  don't  look  at 
 anything  as  failure  because  when  you're 
 willing  to  try  to  do  some  not  trying  is 
 failure  that's  that's  and  that's  not 
 some  after  school  special  [ __ ]  but  when 
 you're  able  to  go  out  there  there  there 
 is  no  failure  it's  attempts  because  when 
 you're  trying  to  do  something  that's 
 bigger  than  you  whatever  you  are  whoever 
 you  are  if  if  if  you're  paralyzed  you 
 trying  to  walk  one  step  and  you  didn't 
 you  didn't  fail  [ __ ]  that  was 
 your  first  attempt  if  that's  your 
 biggest  thing  that's  how  your  mindset 
 needs  to  go  into  everything  so  I  don't 
 look  at  it  as  failure  is  a  big  word  like 
 that  gets  people  down  and  [ __ ]  we  give 
 so  much  power  to  words  I  don't  I  take 
 the  power  right  away  I  didn't  feel  [ __ ] 
 do  you  ever  have  conversations  with  Cam 
 about 
 mindset  we  no  we  we  we  really  don't  go 
 there  too  much  at  all  about  mindset  like 
 whenever  we  get  together  it's  really 
 about  breaking  the  [ __ ]  down 
 like  it's  like  it's  like  but  wouldn't 
 you  be  interested  though  in  how  he 
 approach  because  I  don't  know  if 
 everybody  shares  your  approach  I  know 
 there's  not  very  many  people  like  you 
 right  cam  is  one  of  them  right  so  like 
 how  many  of  them  are  like  you  and  how 
 many  of  them  have  that  sort  of  similar 
 approach  and  how  many  of  them  are 
 willing  to  discuss  their  own  demons 
 because  a  lot  of  people  that  are  like 
 super  endurance  athletes  or  very  hard 
 people  they  don't  ever  want  to  even 
 discuss  the  weakness  they  don't  want  to 
 shine  any  light  on  it  no  people  hate 
 that  yeah  people  hate  it  man  and  I  love 
 it  and  the  re  hate  it  to  me  this  is  just 
 my  own  theory  is  because  you  haven't 
 beat 
 it  that's  why  people  go  man  why  are  you 
 so  open  and  vulnerable  I'll  tell  you 
 everything  I  lied  about  everything  I 
 [ __ ]  up  with  every  I'll  tell  you 
 everything  I  am  an  open  [ __ ]  book  I 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  the  only  reason  why  I 
 don't  give  a  [ __ ]  anymore  is  because  I 
 overcame  it  and  I  beat  it  so  I'm  will  to 
 talk  about  it  why  most  people  aren't 
 willing  to  go  to  that  darkness  and  that 
 vulnerability  is  because  they're  still 
 dealing  with  it 
 when  people  who  have  overcome  it  they're 
 open  [ __ ]  book  bro  because  they're 
 proud  they're  [ __ ]  proud  that's  why  I 
 speak  man  man  why  are  you  always  yelling 
 guys  [ __ ]  you  this  how  I  talk  [ __ ]  cuz 
 I'm  proud  motherfu  you  know  what  I'm 
 saying  I'm  a  proud  [ __ ]  man  it's 
 not  proud  like  look  at  me  it's  like 
 [ __ ]  I  know  where  I  [ __ ]  came 
 from  [ __ ]  I  shouldn't  be  here  right  now 
 talking  to  you  shouldn't  be  talking  to 
 you  [ __ ]  I  shouldn't  be  here  I 
 us  a  fat  sloppy  [ __ ]  I'm  proud 
 so  I'm  able  to  tell  you  I  was  [ __ ]  up 
 many  people  can't  you  know  that's  a 
 common  thing  that  people  say  when  I 
 interview  them  after  fights  like  I'm  not 
 supposed  to  be  here  this  is  not  supposed 
 to  happen  to  me  I  not  there's  a  common 
 thing  when  I've  had  conversations  with 
 people  and  they  you  know  they've  won  a 
 big  fight  they've  had  this  big  event 
 right  they  they  say  I  wasn't  supposed  to 
 be  here  right  statistically  like  Chris 
 Gutierrez  just  said  that  uh  last  UFC 
 fight  when  I  interviewed  him  he  like  I'm 
 not  supposed  to  be  here  right  probably 
 because  they  come  from  a  bad  place 
 exactly  you  know  they  and  when  you're  in 
 a  bad  especially  when  you're  young  you 
 know  redevelop 
 self-esteem  you  know  by  the  age  of  seven 
 if  you're  if  if  if  you're  not  good  by 
 the  age  of  seven  or  eight  years  old  you 
 have  a  good  chance  of  being  [ __ ]  the 
 rest  of  your  life  yeah  so  if  your 
 parents  or  or  you  came  up  wrong  and  then 
 seven  or  eight  if  you  don't  have  the 
 self-esteem  but  you  [ __ ]  grind  you're 
 like  I  want  to  be  better  when  you  get  to 
 that 
 UFC  Championship  or  you  get  to  where 
 where  I  got  or  where  I 
 am  it's  almost  like  you  can't  believe 
 the  journey  like  I  talked  about  in  that 
 [ __ ]  VFW  and  I'm  in  the  first  chapter 
 of  that  book  man  I'm  sitting  in  that 
 audience  all  those  [ __ ]  people  and 
 I'm  about  to  get  the  you  know 
 americanism  award  and  I  was  grinding  so 
 hard  I  never  took  time  to  reflect  in  my 
 life  and  this  was  like  time  to  reflect 
 and  I  was  all  kind  of  [ __ ]  up  I  got  on 
 stage  man  just  [ __ ]  cried  for  like  59 
 seconds 
 and  it  was  such  an  emotional  moment  for 
 me  that  I  [ __ ]  that  I  [ __ ]  did 
 what  I  did  and  I  I  overcame  and  it  was 
 it  was  alone  man  you  know  a  lot  of 
 people  have  [ __ ]  like  teammates  and 
 [ __ ]  like  you  know  family  push  my  my 
 mom  was  struggling  bro  she  was  strug  so 
 it  was  like  me  and  my  mom  and  so  it's  a 
 lot  of  just  me  so  when  you're  waking  up 
 every  morning  by  yourself  and  you're 
 [ __ ]  getting  after  by  yourself  and 
 and  it's  the  it's  the  hidden  work  people 
 see  one  minute  you  know  video  of  me 
 running  and  [ __ ]  like  and  like  these 
 Fighters  you  know  they  they  see  during 
 the  fight  or  after  the  fight  they  don't 
 see  these  [ __ ]  man  what  they 
 deal  with  every  [ __ ]  day  I'm  not  good 
 enough  I'm  not  good  enough  I  shouldn't 
 be  here  I  shouldn't  be  here  because 
 every  day  even  though  they're  [ __ ] 
 the  best  in  the  world  that  little 
 [ __ ]  at  seven  or  eight  years  old 
 is  still  in  there  saying  oh  man  we  we 
 don't  have  so  we're  not  good  enough 
 we're  not  we  shouldn't  be  here  so  you're 
 always  fighting  that  [ __ ]  even 
 though  you  beat  it  you  never  truly  beat 
 it  so  when  they  get  on  stage  and  talking 
 to  Joe  Rogan  it's  it's  a  it's  not  even 
 real  it's  not  even  real  all  those 
 mornings  that  you  didn't  want  to  [ __ ] 
 get  up  and  and  I  look  at  it  as  like  a 
 [ __ ]  like  a  rock  and  you  find  this 
 [ __ ]  rock  and  that  rock  is  you  and 
 every  day  you  [ __ ]  fight  not  wanting 
 to  get  up  and  you  do  anyway  you  chip 
 another  piece  off  that  [ __ ]  rock  and 
 every  day  you  [ __ ]  eat  the  right 
 foods  and  every  day  you  go  to  train  you 
 train  harder  and  harder  and  harder  and 
 harder  and  you  get  up  earlier  and  all 
 these  things  you  do  to  start  forming 
 yourself  you're  chipping  another  [ __ ] 
 piece  of  that  rock  up  before  you  know  it 
 you  have  this  beautiful  [ __ ]  piece  of 
 of  of  of  artwork  that  that  you  built  but 
 people  don't  and  then  once  you  get  there 
 you  see  it  and  it  becomes  real  like  oh 
 my  God  I  [ __ ]  did  this  [ __ ]  and  so 
 like  the  [ __ ]  Journey  becomes  so  real 
 then  but  so  many  people  aren't  willing 
 to  [ __ ]  chip  away  at  that  stone  that 
 is  them  to  start  chipping  off  those 
 [ __ ]  rough  edges  that's  the  fear  the 
 fear  is  never  reach  ing  your  potential 
 that's  it  that  always  falling  short 
 always  quitting  before  you're  done 
 always  procrastinating  always  not  doing 
 the  right  thing  and  then  one  day  you're 
 an  old  man  yep  and  you  look  back  and  go 
 God  I  could  have  been  great  yep  I  could 
 have  been  great  I  never  forget  one  time 
 I  was  running  by  a  graveyard  and  I  was 
 [ __ ]  just  trying  to  become  I  was  fat 
 and  I  ran  by  a  graveyard  and  I  looked 
 out  there  and  I  have  all  these 
 epiphanies  man  I  have  all  these  [ __ ] 
 moments  of  like 
 of  it's  crazy  man  of  of  this  thought  I'm 
 always  by  myself  I'm  always  in  deep 
 [ __ ]  thought  about  how  to  be  better  I 
 look  out  there  I'm  like  man  I  wonder  how 
 many  of  you  [ __ ]  in  there 
 [ __ ]  just  are  so  upset  with  how  you 
 lived  your  life  and  [ __ ]  just  regret 
 how  you  lived  it  and  I'm  running  at  300 
 pound  man  thinking 
 man  don't  [ __ ]  die  like  this  bro 
 don't  die  like  this  so  people  wonder 
 where  this  [ __ ]  comes  from  from 
 me  it  comes  from  such  deep  thought  of 
 trying  to  see  what  this  is  all  about 
 what  is  this  life  all  about  what  am  I 
 all  about  why  am  I  here  you  know  I  had 
 to  I  had  to  find  purpose 
 and  my  suffering  it  had  a  purpose  it  had 
 a  [ __ ] 
 purpose  do  you  talk  to  other  people  that 
 are  like  you  and  try  to  understand  if 
 they're  going  through  the  same  thing  are 
 they're  trying  to  gather  knowledge  as 
 well  are  they  just  doing  it  because 
 they're  addicted  to  Runner's  High  are 
 they  doing  it  because  they  enjoy  the 
 challenge  like  how  many  people  do  you 
 talk  to  that  are  like  you  I've  never 
 talked  to  anyone  that  and  most  people 
 don't  even  believe  what  I  say  half  the 
 time  that  I  I  I  do  it  to  [ __ ]  gain 
 knowledge  and  all  that  [ __ ]  I  haven't 
 met  one  that  goes  out  there  people 
 really  enjoy  a  lot  of  the  [ __ ]  that  they 
 do  like  like  they  I  don't  know  many 
 people  can  go  out  and  run  240  miles  at 
 one  time  if  you  don't  enjoy 
 it  if  if  you  just  don't  don't  really 
 enjoy  it  so  you  know  I  I 
 had  many  people  build  confidence 
 different  ways  and  they  build  belief  in 
 different  ways  coming  from  where  I  came 
 from  I  didn't  have  any  belief  in  myself 
 so  some  people  can  go  read  a  book  and 
 get  belief  some  people  can  go  take  a 
 yoga  class  have  good  parents  I  had  to 
 put  myself  some  where  I  came  from  was  so 
 far  down  underneath  like  soil  that  I  had 
 to  build  belief  by  truly  ingraining  it 
 in  my  brain  so  the  things  I  do  I'm 
 always  every  day  building  belief  and  my 
 belief  had  to  be  where  it  is  because  I 
 was  so  far  down  so  it  may  take  a  200 
 mile  run  for  me  it  may  take  a  100  mile 
 run  it  may  take  late  nights  in  the  gym 
 but  without  belief  you  have  nothing  and 
 I  realized  that  when  I  was  a  young  kid  I 
 have  no  belief  I  have  to  build  it  and  a 
 fivemile  run  didn't  do  it  I  had  to  push 
 myself  to  such  extremes  because  I  came 
 from  people  judge  me  by  not  knowing 
 where  I  came 
 from  so  unless  you're  me  and  you  came 
 from  where  I  came  from  I  guarantee  you 
 would  have  made  it  out  guarantee  it  and 
 I  knew  that  so  my  belief  comes  from 
 going  I  had  to  build  it  and  that's  how  I 
 build  it  man  I  build  it  by  the  things  I 
 do  it's  so  painful  reading  about  your 
 childhood  and  the  experiences  with  your 
 father  and  then  when  you  went 
 back  and  met  your  father  as  an  adult  and 
 got  with  them  and  watched  him  get  drunk 
 and  then  watch  him  get  belligerent  and 
 and  experience  it  all  over 
 again  and  then  think  about  what  happened 
 to  him  to  make  him  who  he  is  yeah  that 
 [ __ ]  me  up  dude  but  I  had  to  go 
 like  I  realized  I  was  [ __ ]  I  was  I  was 
 just  a  sorry  [ __ ]  you  know  I 
 quit  peir  rescue  I  spray  the  water  every 
 time  [ __ ]  got  hard  like  I  said  I  didn't 
 have  talent  you  know  I  I  [ __ ]  didn't 
 have  [ __ ]  and  whenever  [ __ ]  got  hard  for 
 me  I  thought  I  was  on  my  way  out  and  and 
 I  got  suck  back  in  I  become  I  become  a 
 loser  again  real  quick  and  I  see  him  all 
 the  time  there's  a  lot  of  [ __ ]  losers 
 out  here  that  won't  face  it  I  like  oh 
 man  gota  go  back  and  visit  this 
 [ __ ]  I  I  haven't  seen  my  dad  in 
 [ __ ]  years  man  years  but  I  knew  where 
 I  came  from  I  knew  where  my  mindset  came 
 from  I  knew  where  my  demons  were  so  my 
 whole  idea  when  I  went  back  to  see  my 
 dad  was  I  was  hoping  that  I  could  just 
 [ __ ]  call  myself  a  losion  it's 
 because  of  you  Dad  so  I  was  hoping  to  go 
 back  and  get  the  confirmation  that  I 
 always  wanted  that  wasn't  my  fault  that 
 voice  in  my  head  was  so  loud  it's  not 
 your  fault  David  it's  not  your  fault  you 
 can't  read  and  write  it's  not  your  fault 
 that  people  call  you  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  it's 
 not  your  fault  it's  not  your  fault  this 
 not  your  fault  that  it's  not  your  fault 
 that  you're  fat  it's  not  your  fault  that 
 you're  that  that  you  quit  [ __ ]  it's  not 
 your  fault  so  so  I  was  like  okay  man  I'm 
 going  go  back  visit  this  [ __ ]  so 
 I  can  just  squash  it  and  I  can  just  go 
 on  and  be  a  [ __ ]  loser  cuz  you  [ __ ] 
 me  up  and  when  I  got  there  went  drove  to 
 Buffalo  saw  my  dad  same  routine  as  it 
 was  when  I  was  8  years  old  man  walked  in 
 what's  up  went  to  Skate  Land  I  sat  on 
 that  [ __ ]  couch  that  he  would  cheat 
 on  my  mom  with  I  sat  on  that  couch  in 
 the  corner  and  I  was  like  God  what  the 
 [ __ ]  man  and  it  was  a  whole  normal  day 
 and  the  more  I  was  around  him  he  started 
 now  he  started  getting  drunk  and  and  I 
 won't  go  through  the  whole  thing  but  I 
 started  seeing  man  I  started  having  a 
 convers  I  always  have  these 
 conversations  with  myself  like  man  this 
 [ __ ]  he  came  from 
 Hell  his  dad  would  put  him  in  front  of  a 
 furnace  and  like  if  he  moved  he  get 
 burnt  so  when  when  when  my  dad  got 
 beat  um  his  dad  would  put  him  from  the 
 furnace  and  if  he  would  have  move  he'd 
 [ __ ]  get  burnt  up  so  my  dad's  had  to 
 sit  there  and  take  it  so  he  never  dealt 
 with  [ __ ]  demons  so  his  demons  became 
 mine  his  demons  became  mine 
 [ __ ]  think  you  die  and  and  and 
 the  demon  goes  with  you  man  don't  be  a 
 [ __ ]  fool  bro  you  know  like  that's 
 why  I'm  proud  of  myself  I  took  his 
 demons  and  mine  and  people  are  always 
 looking  for  some  great  [ __ ]  apology 
 you  know  oh  my  God  like  um  you  know  my 
 my  dad  need  to  say  sorry  people  who 
 [ __ ]  called  you  out  your  name  or 
 nobody  couldn't  come  back  and  say  sorry 
 to  you  you  [ __ ]  ain't  nobody 
 saying  [ __ ]  to  you  you  better  a  [ __ ] 
 man  the  [ __ ]  up  so  I  looked  at  him  he 
 didn't  face  his  demons  I'm  going  to  face 
 mine  so  on  that  drive  back  home  that's 
 what  I  started  doing  you  know  what's  one 
 of  the  most  most  [ __ ]  up  things  that 
 I've  learned  over  time  is  that  almost 
 all  like  truly  exceptional  and  mentally 
 strong  people  have  been  through  hell 
 it's  it's  very  few  that  put  themselves 
 through  hell  when  life  is  great  it's 
 just  not  usually  the  case  right  and  to 
 to  achieve  the  the  the  standards  that 
 you've  achieved  to  achieve  the  to  become 
 the  person  that  you  are  today  and  to 
 have  the  influence  that  you  have  this 
 Global  influence  on  people  do  you  how 
 many  people  have  laced  up  their  shoes 
 because  they  heard  your  voice  how  many 
 people  have  just  moved  into  action  and 
 changed  their  life  because  they've  heard 
 you  talk  or  seen  you  talk  it's  it's 
 there's  a  thing  that  happened  and  it 
 happened  out  of  hell  and  I  don't  think 
 it  ever  happens  without  that  it's  like 
 you  had  to  go  through  that  in  order  to 
 empower  all  these  other  people  in  order 
 to  become  who  you  are  and  that  as  an 
 example  and  then  your  words  as  an 
 example  and  your  describing  of  it  and 
 then  your  description  of  your  own 
 shortcomings  and  failures  that  give 
 people  confidence  that  you  it's  not  like 
 you're  this  superhuman  person  that  is 
 like  a  character  in  a  book  right  now 
 you're  a  real  human  being  who  has  real 
 insecurities  and  real  failur  in  your 
 past  and  and  and  real  demons  and  you 
 figured  out  a  way  to  harness  that  energy 
 and  just  keep  going  forward  yep  and  not 
 quit  that's  it  that's  it  I  mean  there 
 there  are  no  timeouts  you  know  people 
 like  I  you  know  there's  a  part  in  the 
 book  that  I  talk  about  a  prisoner  mind 
 and  that's  about  my 
 mother  and  you  know  she  just  um  that's  I 
 would  never  listen  to  that  part  again  in 
 that  book  that  was  hard  just  so  you  know 
 man  like  I  will  never  again  listen  to 
 that  [ __ ]  your  mother's  very  very  very 
 brave  oh  to  be  able  to  talk  like  that 
 yeah  to  be  able 
 to  to  be  able  to  talk  like  that  um  to 
 the  world  and 
 to  to 
 just  she  lost  her  life  she  lost  this 
 giant  chunk  of  her  life  with  this 
 abusive 
 man  and  to  hear  her  talking  about  him 
 hitting  her  and  what  it  was  like  and  the 
 fact  that  she  never  came  from  a  family 
 that  hit  her  she  had  never  been  hit 
 before  never  and  to  to  to  have  her 
 express  it  the  way  she  did  so  honestly 
 and 
 openly  very  powerful  and  the  whole  time 
 she's  talking  man  she's  on  the  cusp  of 
 like  losing  it  like  I'm  in  the  other 
 room  so  I'm  I'm  interviewing  her  and  I'm 
 hearing  this  [ __ ]  so  I  I  knew  a  lot 
 about  it  obviously  I  lived  it  and  that's 
 what  [ __ ]  me  up  the  most  man  when  you 
 see  like  I  said  I  wasn't  a  smart  kid 
 growing  up  but  who  whatever  made  me 
 whatever  the  [ __ ]  made  me  I'm  so  [ __ ] 
 my  mind  is  sharp  man  like 
 it's  it's  crazy  like  I  could  I  was  so 
 aware  of  so  much  [ __ ]  I  was  so  bright  in 
 that  way  and  to  see  your  mom  go  through 
 that  [ __ ]  as  that  young  kid  and  like  I 
 was  going  through  it  and  she  was  going 
 through  right  beside  me  like  when  I  got 
 my  ass  beat  she  got  her  ass  beat  it  was 
 it's  [ __ ]  up  man  like  you  you  you  just 
 can't  you  know  people  you  know  people 
 like  to  judge  who  you  are  man  why  you 
 cuss  so  much  man  my  life  wasn't  [ __ ] 
 PG 
 [ __ ]  like  you  know  you  can't 
 just  turn  who  the  [ __ ]  you  are  off  when 
 you  see  your  mom  going  that  kind  of  [ __ ] 
 and  then  I'm  coming  to  her  defense  at 
 seven  or  eight  years  old  and  she's 
 getting  her  [ __ ]  ass  beat  by  a  220  lb 
 man  and  I'm  [ __ ]  some  little  kid  know 
 what  kind  of  Courage  it  takes  to  Muster 
 that  up  to  go  help  her  out  and  to  see 
 her  [ __ ]  up  like  that  and  the  time  she 
 would  cry  and  be  bruised  up  and  [ __ ]  it 
 was  just  it  was  a  it  was  a  [ __ ] 
 nightmare  and  then  hear  her  talk  about 
 it  like  the  part  where  my  dad  says  I 
 brought  this  belt  from  Texas  this  belt 
 came  all  the  way  from  Texas  whip  your 
 ass  with  I  it  it  was  like  what  the  like 
 where  am  I  at  right  now  cuz  I  knew  no 
 other  households  right  were  [ __ ] 
 living  like  this  man  I  and  and  I  knew  it 
 I  knew  it  and  then  she  was  shut  off  she 
 was  shut  off  from  the  world  and  when  I 
 wrote  can't  hurt  me  she 
 refused  she  said  [ __ ]  don't  put  my  [ __ ] 
 in  there  she  was  so  embarrassed  you  know 
 like  like  I  put  in  there  man  she  [ __ ] 
 married  a  [ __ ] 
 prisoner  so  my  mom  was  so  [ __ ]  up  she 
 was  so  [ __ ]  up  by  this  [ __ ]  and  people 
 go  people  go  man  you're  a  mama's  boy 
 [ __ ]  I  know  mama's  boy 
 man  see  your  mom  go  through  this  [ __ ] 
 you're  gonna  make  sure  she's  taken  care 
 of 
 so  she  came  out  and  one  of  the  people 
 that  you  know  she  she  got  married  a  few 
 times  CU  she  was  looking  for  something 
 that  my  dad  stripped  from  her  and  she 
 was  out  she  was  gone  for  years  she  just 
 now  coming  back  she's  70s  she's  75  and 
 but  in  that  book  I  talk  about  man  she's 
 like  don't  don't  put  that  you  know  and 
 can't  hurt  me  but  now  she's  getting 
 better  and  she's  allowing  me  more  to 
 talk  more  about  my  life  which  was  also 
 some  of  her  life  the  part  about  marrying 
 a  prisoner  is  so  crazy  dude  it  was  a 
 [ __ ]  but  not  just  a  prisoner  but  a 
 prisoner  who  killed  a  woman  dude 
 this  so  it  was  so  [ __ ]  up  it's  hard 
 for  me  to  talk  about  because  it's  almost 
 like  it  I  was  I  had  a  front  row  seat  at 
 a  horror  show 
 so  when  my  mom  left  my  dad  she  went  to 
 wilmouth  and  he  got  murdered  I  talk 
 about  that  can't  hurt  me  he  got  murdered 
 so  that  took  her  all  the  way  over  the 
 edge  I  mean  he  got  shot  [ __ ]  six 
 times  and  the  last  shot  this 
 [ __ ]  got  right  up  up  on  his  head 
 and  made  sure  he  was  dead  like  forehead 
 shot  and  so  she  didn't 
 cry  she  didn't  cry  she's  loost  it  was 
 over  she  a  whole  another  person  became 
 and  so  I'm  [ __ ]  now  like  12  13  14 
 what  the  [ __ ]  I  was  I'm  watching  this 
 woman  every  day  front  row  seat  just 
 watching  her  just  go  through  life  [ __ ] 
 up  and  then  I'm  about  to  go  in  the 
 military  into  the  Air 
 Force  and  like  two  years  out  man  you 
 know  I'm  like  a  sophomore  in  high  school 
 phone  ringing  every  night  she  tell  me 
 don't  get  on  the  phone  don't  get  on  the 
 phone  don't  get  on  the  phone  15  minute 
 calls  hang  up  15minute  call  hang  up 
 15minute  call  hang  up  what  the  [ __ ]  is 
 going  on  but  see  the  way  I  was  grow  like 
 the  way  I  was  raised  you  don't  ask  your 
 Mom  what's  going  on  it  a  like  now  like 
 conversations  and  [ __ ]  with  the  parents 
 you  shut  the  [ __ ]  up  and  that's  I  didn't 
 ask  [ __ ]  but  I  knew  something  was  [ __ ] 
 cuz  like  3  four  hours  a  night  15  minute 
 hang  up  cuz  he  was  in  prison  this  guy 
 was  in  prison  so  he  only  had  15  minutes 
 on  the  phone  they  had  to  put  more  money 
 in  it  how  did  she  meet  him  she  started 
 working  so  she  was  always  about  helping 
 people  out  but  the  thing  about  it 
 was  like  I  was  right  in  front  of  her  and 
 needed  so  much  [ __ ] 
 help  and  that  it  was  [ __ ]  up  for  me 
 for  a  long  time  but  she  helped  out  so 
 many  people  but  I  guess  since  I  was  with 
 her  through  the  Journey  I  just  I  didn't 
 count  but  it's  all  good  man  it's  what 
 life's  about  you  got  to  understand  what 
 your  mom  went  through  so  that  I  can  be 
 good  with  it  you  know  like  I  saw  that  so 
 I  I  had  to  man  up  a  lot  more  than  what 
 so  she  saw  people  needed  help  so  she 
 started  teaching  in  the  prison  so  she 
 had  a  full-time  job  at  the  at  the  Paul 
 University  in  Green  Castle  Indiana  and 
 then  she  started  teaching  in  a  prison 
 and  she  met  this  prisoner  this  prisoner 
 obviously  I  don't  know  slitter  or  not  or 
 some  [ __ ]  like  that  and  you  know  she 
 was  looking  for  anything  she  was  looking 
 for  anybody  that  loved  her  because  my 
 dad  beat  the  [ __ ]  life  out  of  her 
 and  and  my  dad  so  my  dad  wouldn't  marry 
 my  mom  but  ended  up  marrying  a  woman 
 um  that  was  tied  to  like  I'm  not  even 
 gonna  go  there  I'm  not  trying  to  get 
 [ __ ]  sued  and  [ __ ]  right  now  man  but 
 he  he  married  somebody  that  was  [ __ ] 
 up  that's  [ __ ]  up  so  anyway  um  she  she 
 she  met  him  in  prison  and  um  the  phone 
 was  ringing  every  night  she  didn't  tell 
 me  about  it  cuz  how  you  can  tell  your 
 son 
 hey  David  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  in  love  with 
 the  prisoner  so  before  I  go  who  murdered 
 the  woman  oh  no  I'm  about  to  get  to  that 
 brother  so  I'm  [ __ ]  now  about  a  week 
 out  or  whatever  the  [ __ ]  was  from 
 leaving  for  boot 
 camp  and  she  lets  me  know  what's 
 up  and  so  I'm  about  to  leave  for  boot 
 camp  and  I'm  so  protective  of  my  mom  and 
 she  lays  this  on  me  yeah 
 um  sit  down  let  me  have  let's  have  a 
 talk  and  she  never  does  this  [ __ ]  man 
 she's  like  there  was  nothing  ever  hidden 
 from  me  that's  why  I  grew  up  so  fast 
 like  that  abusive  life  and  what  she  was 
 going  through  it  was  front  and  center 
 her  her  being  broke  everything  this  was 
 the  only  secret  she  kept  from  me  she  go 
 um  those  phone  calls  you  know  I've  been 
 uh  seeing  someone  in 
 prison  all  right  cool  whatever  but  I'm 
 thinking  what  the  [ __ ]  is  this  man  so 
 you  know  I  hated  I  didn't  want  to  ask 
 how  the  [ __ ]  did  you  get  to 
 prison  so  I'm  sitting  there  I'm  sitting 
 there  I'm  sitting  there  and  I'm  like 
 okay  man  I  got  to  [ __ ]  ask  this 
 [ __ ] 
 question  how  the  [ __ ]  you  know  what  what 
 happened  you  know  she's  like 
 well  does  one  of  those  things  you  know 
 cuz  she  knows  it's  [ __ ]  bad  well  he 
 was  in  the  drugs  and  stuff  like  that  I'm 
 thinking  okay  maybe  drug  dealer 
 something  like  that  he  was  in  the  drugs 
 that's  for  sure  but  he  literally  I  don't 
 know  how  it  went  down  but  he  choked  a 
 woman  to 
 death  over  some 
 drugs  and  I  don't  know  the  ins  and  outs 
 or  all  this  other  [ __ ]  and 
 um  that's  who  she  was  going  to  [ __ ] 
 be  with  and  he  was  getting  out  of  prison 
 literally  in  a  few  weeks  after  I  was 
 going  to  Air  Force  boot  camp  Jes  so  I'm 
 in  [ __ ]  Air  Force  boot  camp  thinking 
 about  my  mom's  about  to  [ __ ]  marry  a 
 [ __ ]  dude  who  got  sent  to  prison 
 marry  him  right  away  too  right  away 
 so  the  first  time  I  meet  this 
 [ __ ]  dude  is  at  my  [ __ ]  Air 
 Force  graduation  oh  Jes  my  [ __ ]  Air 
 Force  graduation  and  she  was  like  you 
 ain't  putting  that  [ __ ]  in  can't  hurt  me 
 she  was  embarrassed  about  it  and  then 
 she  saw  how  I  went  totally  like  [ __ ] 
 vulnerable  and  she  was  like  [ __ ]  it  go 
 ahead  so  there's  there's  so  much  more  to 
 it  but  he  ended  up  um  uh  I  think  it  was 
 last  year  or  maybe  this  year  he  ow 
 so  my  mom  divorced  him  obviously  after 
 it  it  it  it  didn't  work  out  and  she  was 
 telling  me  a  story  one  time  we  were 
 talking  about  this  book  she  started 
 opening  more  up  about  the 
 relationship  with  this  uh  with  this 
 prisoner  and  she  said  one  night  they  got 
 into  a  fight  you  know  not  not  physical 
 you  know  he  never  hit  her  like  like  my 
 dad  did  so  many  times  but  he  said  one 
 night  she  was  sleeping  and  had  had  her 
 back  to  him  and  all  she  thought  about 
 all  [ __ ]  night  was  because  she 
 started 
 slowly  realizing  like  I'm  [ __ ]  up  like 
 I  just  married  a  [ __ ]  guy  from  prison 
 that  killed  somebody  and  she  started 
 realizing  it  more  and  more  but  she's 
 laying  in  bed  and  she  and  she  was  like 
 is  this  [ __ ]  gonna  [ __ ]  kill 
 me 
 tonight  and  she  started  telling  me  these 
 [ __ ]  stories  man  and  I'm 
 like  and  I'm  just  like  what  the  [ __ ]  man 
 like  like  you  know  it's  it's  it  was 
 tough  it  was  it  was  it  was  a  tough  way 
 to  grow  up  man  it  was  tough  tough  way  to 
 grow  up  so  yeah  he  ended  up  um  so  they 
 got  divorced  uh  I  think  it  work  maybe 
 two  years  where  the  [ __ ]  it  was  whatever 
 it  doesn't  matter  and  then  um  I  think  he 
 ODed  last  year  he  OD  last  year  killed 
 himself  I  don't  he  killed  himself  he's 
 OD 
 so  the  the  idea  of  you  going  off  to  boot 
 camp  knowing  that  your  mom's  going  to  be 
 alone  with  this  guy  getting  out  of 
 prison  yeah  that  [ __ ]  must  have  been 
 haunting  yeah  [ __ ]  up  every  night  oh  my 
 God  every  night  I'm  I'm  I'm  sitting  in 
 the  [ __ ]  in  my  bunk  thinking  and  then 
 I  I  I  knew  the  date  he  was  getting  out 
 of  prison  and  like  you  know  you  can't 
 just  get  on  the  phone  and  call  hey  Mom 
 what's  going  on  you  know  no  you're  in 
 boot  camp  you  get  like  every  now  and 
 then  they  say  okay  you  have  like  a  phone 
 call  once  a  week  or  some  [ __ ]  I  think 
 every  Sunday  was  a  phone 
 call  and  I'll  never  forget  when  he  got 
 to  the  house  man  I  actually 
 got  I  was  [ __ ]  not  right  so  I  got 
 recycled  so  a  week  in  boot  camp  so  like 
 I  [ __ ]  I  don't  know  what  I  [ __ ] 
 did  something  in  boot  camp  and  [ __ ] 
 got  recycled  had  like  I  was  sneaking  the 
 Snickers  bars  I  was  just  all  kind  of 
 belligerant  and  [ __ ]  I  was  just  out  of 
 it  I  I  was  I  was  sneaking  out  and  this 
 [ __ ]  I  was  just  [ __ ]  not  right  I 
 was  wasn't  right  and  so  then  I  um  yeah 
 that's  it  was  [ __ ]  up  it's  it's  [ __ ] 
 up  what  was  it  like  when  you  met 
 him  I  try  to  be  supportive  cuz  that's 
 what  I  always  did  my  mom  whatever  made 
 her  happy  I  try  to  that  that  was  my 
 [ __ ]  number  one  priority  was  I  I 
 never  cared  about  myself  never  never 
 ever  which  makes  what  I  do  now  for 
 people  I  I 
 understand  because  I  care  about  people 
 even  though  I'm  an  introvert  I'm  an 
 introvert  because  my  [ __ ]  life 
 sucked  but  what  I  do  for  people  I  really 
 do  that's  why  I  want  to  make  sure  that 
 [ __ ]  like  that  that  [ __ ]  book  and 
 things  I  do  that's  why  I  don't  [ __ ] 
 like  why  don't  you  sell  [ __ ]  why  don't 
 you  always  you  know  why  aren't  you  like 
 promoting  this  and  that  and  no  man  no  I 
 care  that  you  understand  that  I  [ __ ] 
 want  to  see  you  [ __ ]  kill 
 [ __ ]  I  want  to  see  you  better  so  you 
 know  when  I  met  him  I  was  supportive  and 
 I  was  and  I  sat  back  and  looked  at  him 
 and  I  wanted  to  [ __ ]  beat  this 
 [ __ ]  down  so  bad  because  I  knew 
 like  you're  not  a  good  egg  bro  you're 
 not  a  good  egg  man  I'm  not  saying  yeah  I 
 mean  you  know  I'm  not  saying  prisoners 
 are  B 
 they  can  be  re 
 rehabilitated  but  I  always  had  these 
 feelings  about  people  if  I  get  around 
 you  I  can  [ __ ]  I  I  may  not  tell  you 
 but  when  you  grow  up  the  way  I  grow  up 
 man  you  have  this  you  have  these  ways  of 
 knowing  pieces  of  [ __ ]  I  became  an 
 expert  in  pieces  of  [ __ ]  I  used  to  be 
 one  my  dad  was  one  so  you  can  [ __ ] 
 pick  him  out  you  can  pick  out  liars  and 
 all  kind  of  K  artists  from  from  a  mile 
 away  cuz  [ __ ]  I  studied  it 
 studied  myself  I  know  who  you  are  so  you 
 can't  come  around  me  bullshitting  me  man 
 can't  right 
 so  it's  just  it  was  horrible  it  was 
 horrible  so  you  know  like  the  the  one 
 woman  I  cared  about  more  than  anything 
 in  the  world  cuz  I  saw  her  hell  I'm 
 looking  at  this  [ __ ]  now  and  now  I'm 
 have  to  go  to  [ __ ]  PA  rescue  school 
 and  all  this  other  [ __ ]  while  she's 
 [ __ ]  with  this  guy  so  there  are  a  lot 
 of  things  in  my  mind  that  that  just  made 
 hard  that  I  studied  I  studied  my  mind 
 during  these  times  I  started  and  this 
 this  process  to  become  who  am  today  of 
 learning  life  and  how  hard  life  is 
 that's  why  I  don't  speak  about  the  good 
 times  everybody  gets  so  mad  why  don't 
 you  speak  about  the  good  times  I  don't 
 need  to  help  you  through  those  brother  I 
 do  not  need  to  help  you  you  don't  turn 
 on  David  Goggins  to  for  the  good  times 
 you  turn  on  David  Goggins  when  you  don't 
 feel  like  doing  [ __ ]  you're  an  expert  in 
 dark  matter  dark  [ __ ]  matter 
 that's  what  I  am  so  yeah  I  know  it 
 really  well  so  it  wasn't  like  I  wished 
 for  it  one  of  the  things  that's 
 hilarious  in  the  book  is  that 
 you  you  read  all  the  [ __ ]  that  people 
 write  to  you  all  the 
 hate  and  you  record  it  and  then  you  play 
 it  back  brother  I'm  G  to  tell  you  right 
 now  man  that  started  honestly  when  this 
 [ __ ]  seal  from  SEAL  Team 
 Six  came  out  and  started  lying  his 
 [ __ ]  ass  off  about  me  this  is  an 
 important  subject  we  should  talk  about 
 this  cuz  your  military  career  and  the 
 what  you've  done  is  always 
 misrepresented  oh  yeah  even  by  people 
 that  should  know  better  oh  yeah  oh  they 
 know  better  but  what  what  makes  people 
 feel  good  like  when  when  you  become 
 successful  when  you  become  successful 
 and  I  had  to  realize  this  and  this  guy 
 made  me  realize  this 
 I  had  to  study  them  when  you  become 
 successful  especially  within  a 
 fraternity  like  that  like  this  is  this 
 is  a  fraternity  bro  this  isn't  like  a 
 [ __ ]  like  oh  like  in  the  Air  Force 
 you  know  it  was  this  is  a  very  different 
 world  so  several  seals  no  I'm  going  to 
 say  there's  a  lot  that  would  like  to  see 
 me  [ __ ]  a  lot  they  like  to  see  a  lot 
 of  people  not  do  well  and  them  do  great 
 yeah  and  like  they  all  know  we  eat  our 
 own  we  eat  our  own  and  that's  what  they 
 all  say  we  eat  our  own  is  that  all  seals 
 I  don't  know  all  seals  a  lot  of  seals  I 
 can't  speak  that  way  I  know  a  few  seals 
 is  it  just  the  hyper  competitive  nature 
 of  the  type  of  people  to  get  involved 
 yeah  it's  like  you  know  we  have  this 
 this  uh  this  this  this  mcho 
 stigma  that  you  know  like  you  know  we're 
 we're  the  best  of  the  best  we're  [ __ ] 
 we're  we're  we're  the  bad  [ __ ] 
 in  the  world  and  and  I  I  beg  to  differ 
 you  know  like  people  go  like  I've  had  so 
 many  people  in  art  like  the  news 
 oh  my  God  they  contact  me  all  they  want 
 me  so  bad  cuz  there's  been  some  things 
 that  came  up  you  know  the  Navy  SE 
 Community  um  this  this  guy  died  this 
 this  kid  going  through  training  died  and 
 some  Navy  Seals  I  don't  know  the  stories 
 they  can  Google  it  where  the  [ __ ]  I 
 guess  they  kill  somebody  over  in  Iraq 
 who  has  some  information  some  [ __ ]  so 
 they  always  want  to  get  me  on  so  I  can 
 [ __ ]  because  they  know  that  I  was  not  a 
 fan  of  a  lot  of  Navy  SEALs  and  a  lot  of 
 it  is  to  do  of  with  the  lies  the  [ __ ] 
 some  of  the  leadership  problems  some  of 
 the  character  issues  and  I  got  to  see 
 that  a  lot  when  I  got  out  and  I'm  the 
 one  to  say  it  I  had  a  lot  of  problems 
 myself  when  I  was  growing  up  and  it  took 
 a  long  time  for  me  go  so  I'm  not  judging 
 these  people  I  know  where  the  [ __ ]  comes 
 from  man  the  [ __ ]  comes  from  [ __ ]  you 
 haven't  handled  so  I  it  doesn't  even 
 bother  me  anymore  but  when  I  came 
 out  um  in  2018 
 this  this  still  from  still  Team  Six  he 
 had  and  Jennifer  it  pissed  Jennifer  off 
 so  [ __ ]  bad  and  I  was  cool  about  it 
 but  this  guy  started  YouTube  channels 
 saying  that  I  was  dishonestly  discharged 
 I  [ __ ]  was  kicked  out  of  the  SEAL 
 Teams  I  um  I  refused  to  fight  in  combat 
 I  never  went  to  combat  I  mean  every  bit 
 of  it  so  the  reason  why  in  my  and  can't 
 hurt  me  I  have  my  write  up  of  my  metal 
 from 
 Iraq  and  I  wasn't  going  to  put  that  in 
 there  but  Jennifer  started  getting  DMS 
 from  people  saying  do  you  know  I'm  not 
 I'm  not  even  going  to  name  his  name 
 that's  not  who  I  am  dude  and  I  just 
 showed  you  outside  about  that  one  cat 
 yeah  I'm  not  gonna  name  his  name  either 
 but  I'm  not  going  to  name  his  name 
 because  how  does  he  not  know  better 
 though  that's  the  the  the  that  was  one 
 of  the  things  that  people  bring  up  that 
 you  never  deployed  right  yep  why  would 
 they  say  that  why  you  think  Joe  think 
 about  it  man  think  about  it  see  like 
 this  the  thing  but  that's  something 
 that's  easily  proven  exactly  but  guess 
 what  this  guy  had  Black  Ops  literally  he 
 was  he  was  he  had  like  YouTube  channels 
 dming  people  because  people  like  at  this 
 time  I  started  getting  a  little  bigger  I 
 started  getting  a  little  more  profile 
 and  he  was  coming  out  of  the  SEAL  Teams 
 I'm  not  gonna  say  his  name  because  I'm 
 not  going  to  try  to  take  food  out  of  his 
 mouth  and  this  is  one  thing  I  learned 
 from  all  of  this  I  had  this  I  was  so 
 [ __ ]  pissed  man  I  was  so  [ __ ] 
 pissed  I  didn't  deploy  I  mean  the 
 [ __ ]  lies  were  insane  how  many  times 
 did  you  deploy  twice  one  to  Guam  and  one 
 to  Iraq  and  then  what  they  don't  talk 
 about  though  is  the  reason  I  didn't 
 deploy  more  is  I  had  two  heart 
 surgeries  so  I  was  out  of  the  [ __ ] 
 teams  for  deploying  for  like  three  four 
 years  because  the  heart  surgeries 
 because  when  you  get  a  heart  Sur  you 
 can't  go  back  to  deploy  you  were  born 
 with  like  holes  in  your  heart  right  with 
 a  hole  in  my  heart  and  the  first  surgery 
 it  didn't  you  know  it  didn't  take  try  to 
 get  another  surgery  so  that  took  so  much 
 time  having  these  heart  surgeries  so  I 
 was  in  um  recruiting  at  the  time  so  this 
 kept  me  in  recruiting  so  this  even  added 
 to  the  whole  [ __ ]  this  added  to  the 
 whole  [ __ ]  so  they  were  loving  it 
 because  right  now  like  I  said  I  wouldn't 
 like  the  most  famous  seal  within  the 
 SEAL 
 Teams  I  didn't  take  [ __ ]  man  it  [ __ ]  was 
 [ __ ]  up  I  called  it  I  called  it 
 there's  there's  no  secret  there  there's 
 no  secret  [ __ ]  here  man  and  and  and  I 
 knew  what  happened  when  I  when  I  got  out 
 and  this  guy  started  doing  this  [ __ ]  and 
 I  I  knew  why  he  was  doing  it  because  the 
 biggest  thing  like  he  wanted  to  take  my 
 character  and  destroy  it  right  that's 
 all  he  wanted  to  do  and  so  when  you're 
 in  these  kind  of  communities  like  this 
 man  people  like  oh  no  there's  no  way  he 
 was  trying  to  do  that  man  I  wish  I  can 
 get  Jennifer  here  right  now  we  have  all 
 the  screenshots  and  I  had  to  get  a 
 [ __ ] 
 lawyer  I  mean  this  guy  went  so  far  and 
 then  what  happened  was  over  a  period  of 
 time  he  [ __ ] 
 literally  apologized  went  away  [ __ ] 
 took  all  this  [ __ ]  down  I  mean  but  he 
 came  out  and  but  what  happened  was  that 
 rumor  mill  spread  like  wildfire  did  he 
 have  to  know  did  he  have  to  be  told 
 about  your  actual  record  no  he  knew 
 never  I  deployed  with  him  what  I 
 deployed  with  him  in  Iraq  no  in  Iraq  he 
 was  just  lying  in  Iraq  I  deployed  with 
 him  in  the  only  [ __ ]  see  man  you  got  get 
 me  to  the  point  where  I  say  his  [ __ ] 
 name  because  I  swear  to  God  so  I 
 deployed  with  his  ass  that's  why  I  put 
 the  [ __ ]  right  up  in  there  so  I  got  a 
 medal  over  there  in  Iraq  I  got  a  medal 
 in  Iraq  so  I  did  go  to  war  and  I  put  it 
 in  the  book  Because  when  because 
 Jennifer  started  getting  all  this  [ __ ] 
 and  she  goes  you  got  to  put  that  [ __ ] 
 award  in  there  because  this  [ __ ] 
 is  just  ly  his  ass  off  I  didn't  go  to 
 Ranger  school  all  this  [ __ ]  so  I  put  the 
 Ranger  school  everything  he  said 
 I  put  in  can't  hurt  me  because  he  was 
 just  literally  lying  trying  to  literally 
 ruin  who  I  was  cuz  I'm  the  world's 
 toughest  man  that  doesn't  sit  right  with 
 some  [ __ ]  Alpha  [ __ ]  dude 
 and  these  [ __ ]  dude  some  of 
 them  and  you  don't  know  unless  you've 
 been  in  the  fraternity  like  this  unless 
 you've  been  in  the  fraternity  like  this 
 you  don't  [ __ ]  know  I  don't  [ __ ] 
 care  about  them  there's  some  I  some 
 great  friends  in  there  but  anyway  the 
 reason  this  guy  actually  helped  me  out 
 so  when  I  came  out  there's  a  few  guys  in 
 that  came  after  me  in  the  seel  teams 
 trying  to  make  sure  that  I  [ __ ] 
 wasn't  going  to  be  who  I  am  and  they 
 still  talk  their  [ __ ]  lies 
 lies  so  many  [ __ ]  lies  dude  and 
 what's  great  about  is  my  proof  isn't 
 can't  hurt  me  so  everything  they  say  my 
 proof  is  in  and  that's  why  it's  designed 
 that  way  for  the  Liars  but  this  guy  came 
 out  and  what  I  do  is  I  studied  him  so 
 Jennifer  goty  lawyer  I'm  about  to  sue 
 the  [ __ ]  out  of  this  [ __ ]  guy  man 
 like  I  had  all  this  defamation  I  mean  it 
 was  [ __ ]  a  thick  I  was  going  to  sue 
 the  [ __ ]  out  of  him  and  every  night  I 
 [ __ ]  woke 
 up  I  was  like  man  I  started  think  about 
 myself  when  I  was  a  piece  of  [ __ ]  when  I 
 had  no  character  when  I  had  no  pride  no 
 dignity  that's  CU  only  people  that  do 
 [ __ ]  like  that  you're  not  a  man  right 
 you're  no  [ __ ]  man  dude  like  I  start 
 thinking  about  what  kind  of  [ __ ]  you 
 are  man  what  how  you  must  have  so  many 
 [ __ ]  demons  in  your  life  that  you 
 spend  this  kind  of  time  just  trying  to 
 take  another  man  just  trying  to  take 
 another  man  and  not 
 I  it'd  be  different  if  it  was  truth 
 behind  it  right  lies  [ __ ]  lies  yeah 
 just  because  we  didn't  get  along 
 [ __ ]  it  don't  mean  I  wasn't  who 
 I  am  we  didn't  get  along  [ __ ] 
 cuz  I  [ __ ]  I'm  like  a  lie  detector 
 cuz  I'm  so  [ __ ]  honest  with  myself  I 
 had  such  a  hard  time  in  my  life  that  I 
 [ __ ]  so  forthright  when  you  get  even 
 near 
 me  cuz  I  [ __ ]  you  know  my  [ __ ]  is 
 real  it's  [ __ ]  real  as  [ __ ]  it  makes 
 you  feel  bad 
 if  you  got  something  going  on  in  your 
 [ __ ]  life  I  Ain  open  my  [ __ ]  mouth 
 you  know  my  [ __ ]  is  [ __ ]  real  yeah  I 
 may  not  deployed  as  many  times  you 
 [ __ ]  because  my  heart  issues  and 
 the  other  issues  that  I  won't  talk  about 
 cuz  the  [ __ ]  news  wants  me  to  [ __ ] 
 talk  about  this  [ __ ]  so  bad  they  want  to 
 take  some  Ste  down  so  bad  I  ain't  no 
 [ __ ]  like  that  whatever  happened  to  se 
 teams  with  me  it  happened  to  SEAL  Teams 
 that's  why  I  don't  [ __ ]  mention  the 
 names  but  I  saw  these  little  [ __ ] 
 come  out  here  it  was  in  the  fraternity 
 it  happened  in  the  fraternity  leave  it 
 there  don't  be  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  come  out 
 here  [ __ ]  spreading  lies  about  me 
 [ __ ]  but  I  studied  all  these 
 little  [ __ ]  who  try  to  come  out  and 
 ruin  my  life  studied  all  of  them  like 
 man  what  you  must  be  going  through  is 
 [ __ ]  evil  I  even  took  a  step  further 
 I  had  to  mature  myself  because  I  was  so 
 [ __ ]  mad  and  I  looked  at  his  family 
 this  guy  who  was  talking  this  [ __ ]  I  G 
 to  say  his  name  so  bad  but  I  never  will 
 because  that's  a  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  move  on 
 my 
 part  you  can  take  food  out  of  this 
 [ __ ]  his  family's  mouth 
 you're  G  to  have  this  guy  in  the 
 courthouse  you  have  him  in  the  courtroom 
 spending  money  on 
 lawyers  and  I  [ __ ]  just  [ __ ] 
 dropped  it  I  said  I'm  good  I  said  I  know 
 who  the  [ __ ]  I  am  I  said  you  can  wake  up 
 every  [ __ ]  morning  being  the  [ __ ] 
 that  you  are  but  I'm  not  going  to 
 [ __ ]  take  money  out  of  your  pocket 
 and  money  out  of  your  mouth  out  of  your 
 [ __ ]  kids  kids  mouth  and  this  kid 
 this  guy  wound  up  apologizing  to  you  he 
 didn't  apologized  to  me  what  happened 
 was  he  got  on  and  I  don't  want  to  go  too 
 deep  because  they  will  figure  it  out 
 but  um  he  ended  up  basically  saying  he's 
 he  had  a 
 [ __ ]  he  he  just  wasn't  he  wasn't 
 right  in  his  head  he  was  he  was  you  know 
 he  wasn't  good  I  and  I  can  tell  he 
 wasn't  good  because  he  was  literally 
 dming  people  and  I  I  wish  I  had  Jennifer 
 in  here  man  so  she  can  show  you  the  DMS 
 he  was  deeming  people  and  talking  all 
 this  [ __ ]  and  then  he  would  delete  it 
 and  this  guy  H  how  so  so  so  Jennifer 
 found  it  and  so  cuz  this  guy  dm' 
 Jennifer  and  was  like  um  hey  can  you  do 
 you  do  you  know  this  guy  and  I  was  like 
 yeah  I  know  him  and  then  J  was  like  Hey 
 we  got  to  [ __ ]  shut  this  [ __ ]  down 
 but  he  was  DM  and  several  people  just 
 saying  that  I  was  dis  AR  be  discharged  I 
 was  kicked  out  of  the  SEAL  Teams  I 
 refused  to  go  to  combat  um  he  just  went 
 on  and  on  and  on  and  so  this  guy  was 
 taking  screenshots  of  what  of  what  this 
 guy  was  saying  and  sending  them  to  us 
 and  so  at  this  time  now  we  have  a  lawyer 
 and  so  we're  were  getting  all  this  [ __ ] 
 dude  and  then  he  had  a  YouTube  site 
 setup  that  he  took  down  just  trying  to 
 literally  ruin  who  I  was  and  I  looked  at 
 all  this  [ __ ]  and  I  studied  them  I  was 
 like  man  you  got  and  what  came  out  later 
 on  was  he  did  have  some  demons  he  does 
 have  some  Demons  of  course  he  does 
 serious  demons  that's  how  insane  it  is 
 that  the  guy  deployed  with  you  SEAL  Team 
 Six  and  these  [ __ ]  supposed  to 
 be  bass  [ __ ]  see  this  is  this  is 
 some  of  the  issues  I  had  when  I  was  in 
 is  that  when  you  work  so  hard 
 man  I  put  these  [ __ ]  like  I 
 talked  about  last  time  I  was  on  this 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  on  a  pedestal  half  the 
 reason  I  ran  on  broken  legs  half  the 
 reason  why  I  [ __ ]  became  who  I  became 
 was  because  of  the  the 
 image  these  guys  had  on  me  I  was  so 
 impressed  with  the  books  and  the  [ __ ] 
 and  the  and  the  and  the  people  that  they 
 were  I  was  like  my  God  man  I  got  to  be  a 
 [ __ ]  God  I  got  to  be  a  god  mentally 
 to  [ __ ]  get  in  here  and  once  I  got  in 
 I  discovered  something  different  I'm  not 
 saying  that  I'm  not  saying  everybody  I'm 
 not  I  don't  know  everybody  in  the  seel 
 teams  but  I  had  a  problem  with  the  fact 
 that  a  lot  of  people  lived 
 this  this  [ __ ]  like  a  lot  of  the 
 civilians  like  oh  my  God  the  seals  are 
 this  the  seals  are  that  you  were  able  to 
 run  badwater  135  because  you're  a  Navy 
 SEAL  and  because  they  like  no 
 [ __ ]  that  ain't  why  and  I  always 
 knew  the  [ __ ]  and  I  had  issues  with  it 
 man  I  had  issues  with  it  so  I  had  a 
 [ __ ]  I  had  issues  with  it  a  lot  of 
 people  didn't  like  that  and  then  I  went 
 on  to  go  and  recruiting  for  a  little  bit 
 and  then  the  heart  surgeries  happened  so 
 the  more  I  was  in  recruiting  the  more  I 
 was  that  [ __ ]  happened  they  just  started 
 slowly  building  up  lies  slowly  building 
 up  lies  and  I  came  out  to  I  was  I  told 
 Jennifer  I  and  I  knew  it  I  said 
 standby  stand  by  it's  coming  whenever 
 you're  a  person  that  gets 
 what  other  people  think  is  attention 
 that  they  think  they  deserve  yes  sir 
 that's  when  things  get  weird  oh  yeah 
 that's  why  they  bring  those  [ __ ] 
 deployments  because  they  think  oh  my  God 
 you  didn't  deploy  as  much  as  me  you 
 didn't  deploy  as  much  as  me  he  was  this 
 he's  not  known  for  being  for  for 
 deploying  and  [ __ ]  yeah  [ __ ] 
 don't  care  yeah  I  have  I  have  a  combat 
 deployment  and  I  deployed  another  time 
 that  we  were  supposed  to  it  was  right 
 during  9/11  we  were  supposed  to  go  and 
 they  [ __ ]  had  us  over  in  Guam  we  were 
 all  pissed  off  didn't  work  out  that  way 
 but  I  got  over  there  and  what's  funny 
 about  it  this  is  this  is  what  makes  me 
 laugh  so  much  there's  a  lot  of  Navy  C 
 who  never  deployed  over  combat  ever 
 ever  and  it  makes  me  laugh  because 
 [ __ ]  want  to  act  like  one 
 combat  deployment  where  I  fought  for  my 
 [ __ ]  country  it's 
 [ __ ]  think  about  that  fought  from  my 
 [ __ ]  country  did  my  [ __ ]  sorry  it 
 worked  out  the  way  it  worked  out 
 and  that's  that's  a  that's  not  enough  I 
 think  it  part  part  of  the  problem  with 
 some  of  those  guys  is  when  guys  are 
 seriously  Alpha  and  they  think  they  go 
 above  and  beyond  and  they  push  harder 
 than  anybody  and  then  they  meet  you  and 
 you're  the  guy  that's  getting  up  at  3:30 
 in  the  morning  yelling  at  them  while 
 you're  running  like  I  know  you're 
 sleeping  I  know  you're  still  in  bed 
 [ __ ]  I'm  out  here  running  10 
 miles  before  you  eat  breakfast  that's 
 half  the  reason  I  did  it  yeah  that's 
 half  the  reason  that  [ __ ]  going 
 to  [ __ ]  halisco  and  [ __ ]  getting 
 waffle  breakfast  and  [ __ ]  bacing  and 
 eggs  [ __ ]  that  bothered  me  I  said 
 [ __ ]  I  got  my  family  and 
 everybody  thinking  I'm  some  [ __ ]  stud 
 and  you  all  just  got  to  [ __ ]  lift 
 some  weights  y'all  don't  want  to  [ __ ] 
 like  I  said  I  was  in  charge  of  PT  and 
 they're  like  Noah  this  ain't  buzz  goggin 
 like  man  you  got  a  lot  of  [ __ ] 
 food  this  ain't  everybody  I  don't  know 
 every  seal  I  don't  know  every  seal  but 
 you  want  to  run  your  [ __ ]  mouth  about 
 me  and  talk  your  little  [ __ ]  I  got  my 
 secrets  too  and  I  won't  say  names  cuz 
 only  a  [ __ ]  does  that  so  keep  on 
 running  your  [ __ ]  mouths  I  know  all 
 you  [ __ ]  so  you  started  taking 
 over  PT  yeah  I  was  so  when  I  got  back  so 
 I  went  on  my  first  deployment  and  when  I 
 came  back  off  my  first  deployment  I 
 begged  put  seven  chits  in  seven  chits 
 it's  like  a  request  chit  to  go  to  Ranger 
 school  [ __ ]  don't  request  to  go 
 to  Ranger  school  I  wanted  to  go  to 
 Ranger  school  as  a  seal  you  went  through 
 buds  whatever  the  [ __ ]  you  don't  want  to 
 go  to  another  course  to  get  your  ass 
 kicked  I  did  I  did  so  much  Ranger  school 
 came  back  honor  man  I  was  the  enlisted 
 honor  man  at  Ranger  school  but  they  say 
 I'm  a  bad  operator  they  also  say  I'm  a 
 bad  operator  but  guess  what  they  had  my 
 black  ass  when  I  was  [ __ ]  in  Iraq  I 
 was  chared  it's  called  PSD  okay  so 
 you're  like  a  bodyguard  I'm  a  bad 
 operator  Joe  but  guess  where  I  was  I  was 
 the  lead 
 Navigator  so  I'm  the  eyes  so  everything 
 we  did  was  in  the 
 car  it  was  my  job  to  make  sure  that 
 whole  [ __ ]  platoon  was 
 safe  okay  you're  not  going  to  put  a  dumb 
 bad  operator  up  there  who's  [ __ ]  not 
 good  it's  my  job  to  make  sure  I  called 
 all  the  outs  called  all  the  trouble 
 coming  had  to  get  us  there  safe  we  had 
 the  [ __ ]  guy  who  was  going  for  the 
 prime  minister's  job  who  we  a  garden  and 
 they  had  a  bad  operator  what  they  want 
 to  call  me  they  want  to  say  the  little 
 [ __ ]  rumors  I  was  the  guy  who  let  it 
 and  it  was  so  good  I  did  such  a  good  job 
 that  there's  two  of  us  cuz  the  job's 
 very  stressful  being  a  primary  Navigator 
 stressful  so  they  have  a  primary  and  a 
 secondary  so  some  days  I  would  do  it 
 some  days  another  guy  would  do  it  I  was 
 doing  such  a  good  job  Joe  that  they 
 didn't  want  the  other  guy  to  do  it  so  I 
 became  the  only  guy  navigating  us 
 through  [ __ ]  Iraq  all  right  and  our 
 guy  didn't  live  in  the  green  zone  the 
 green  zone  is  a  safe  place  our  guy  lived 
 in  the  red  zone  so  we  had  to  go  out  in 
 the  Red  Zone  every  day  to  get  this 
 [ __ ]  guy  bring  it  back  in  no  there 
 was  no  shoot  him  UPS  cuz  this  one  one 
 rumor  that  was  out  there  that  came  out 
 from  this  guy  was  I 
 froze  I  froze  in  a  firefight  it's  kind 
 of  funny  how  you  can  freeze  in  a 
 firefight  when  oure  was  never  in 
 morning  so  it's  just  just  [ __ ]  man 
 but  I  know  where  it  comes  from  I  know 
 where  it  comes  from  crabs  in  a  bucket  I 
 know  where  it  comes  from  my  friend  it's 
 just  crabs  in  a  bucket  that's  it  sorry 
 sorry  I  became  so  successful  guys  that's 
 what  it  is  people  don't  like  it  when  you 
 did  the  same  thing  they  did  you  come 
 from  the  same  fraternity  but  you  get 
 exort  exorbitant  amounts  of  attention 
 and  success  oh  yeah  and  instead  of 
 looking  at  that  and  going  wow  look  what 
 he  did  that's  amazing  I  wish  I  did  that 
 or  maybe  I  could  do  more  or  he's 
 inspiring  other  people  and  that's  great 
 you  know  what  though  I  will  say  this 
 there's  a  there's  a  lot  of  them  that  do 
 say  that  that's  great  there's  a  lot  of 
 them  that  do  say  this  I  have  a  guy  named 
 Hawk  you  know  that  that  email  I  sent  to 
 you  a  while  ago  about  this  guy  who  wrote 
 that  email  about  the  SEAL  Teams  and  I 
 shared  it  with  you  you  about  he's 
 talking  about  like  only  133%  of  you 
 actually  it's  like  anyway  I  sent  email 
 remember  so  anyway  he's  a  guy  that  sent 
 that  email  Hawk  he's  like  my  best  friend 
 so  he  uh  bad  [ __ ]  when  he  when 
 he  got  out  of  SE  teams  he  wrote  this 
 email  and  sent  out  to  like  every  Navy  SE 
 and  it  was  like  87%  of  you  [ __ ] 
 he  said  87%  of  you  [ __ ]  you 
 know  are  are  living  off  of  one  week  and 
 what  he  was  talking  about  was  hell  week 
 like  that  one  week  in  hell  week  is  all 
 they're  living  off  of  cuz  they're  not 
 living  it  now  and  he  made  these  shirts 
 called  the  133%  shirts  and  the  other 
 133%  guys  are  actually  getting  after  it 
 that  [ __ ]  sent  me  two  of 
 them  all  right  he  sent  me  two  of  them  so 
 yeah  they're  right  I  wish  I  could  have 
 deployed  more  and  blah  blah  blah 
 whatever  and  whatever  man  but  I  was  I 
 was  a  [ __ ]  good  seal  and  [ __ ]  good 
 teammate  and  some  guys  didn't  like  me 
 and  in  the  fraternity  [ __ ]  had  it  out 
 and  there's  a  time  somebody  [ __ ]  did 
 some  [ __ ]  but  is  what  it  is  man  you  ever 
 heard  uh  when  people  talk  about  some 
 Union  work  one  of  the  things  that 
 happens  when  you're  in  some  unions  is 
 like  if  you're  working  too  hard  someone 
 will  come  along  go  hey  David  slow  the 
 [ __ ] 
 down  Bad  true  statement  like  you're 
 moving  too  many  packages  you're  doing 
 too  much  of  this  to  too  much  of  that 
 you're  setting  the  standard  too  high  and 
 you're  [ __ ]  it  up  for  everybody  else 
 and  so  you'll  have  people  that  will 
 sabotage  someone  mhm  just  because  that 
 person 
 wants  to  work  hard  oh  I  see  it  but  it 
 made  me  grow  it  made  me  grow  and  I  and 
 I'm  glad  I  didn't  put  a  case  on  that  guy 
 and  I'm  glad  I  got  a  chance  to  study  him 
 and  it  is  what  it  is  man  it  is  what  it 
 is  and  this  is  one  part  that  I  try  to 
 tell  people  and  teach  them  if  you're 
 trying  to  go  to  that  uncommon  amongst 
 the  uncommon  place  it's  a  lonely 
 [ __ ]  up  there  man  it's  lonely 
 I'm  not  saying  I'm  better  than  every 
 [ __ ]  body  I'm  not  saying  that  and 
 once  again  I'm  not  speaking  for  every 
 seal  I'm  not  but  I  just  didn't  I  didn't 
 try  to  be  what  they  were  what  you're 
 just  saying  is  just  a  fact  it's  just  a 
 fact  man  it's  just  a  fact  and  there 
 there's  people  that  are  willing  to  go 
 very  far  and  then  there's  people  that 
 are  willing  to  go  far  further  than  them 
 that's  it  and  when  your  person  who 
 prides  yourself  on  your  ability  to  go 
 very  far  and  then  someone  is  willing  to 
 go  far  farther  than  you  you  have  to 
 decide  do  I  want  to  look  at  that  as  the 
 new  standard  do  I  want  to  judge  myself 
 do  I  want  to  admire  him  or  do  I  want  to 
 try  to  take  him  down  because  I  feel  bad 
 because  I  can't  do  what  he  does  or 
 haven't  done  what  he  does  or  what  he 
 does  makes  me  look  bad  because  I  like  to 
 think  I'm  a  hard  worker  I  like  to  think 
 I'm  disciplined  and  hard  and  then  I  see 
 this  [ __ ]  dude  out  there  that  just 
 making  me  look  soft  right  and  so  instead 
 of  just  going  look  at  him  man  [ __ ]  yeah 
 right  instead  of  a  smart  person  would 
 look  at  that  person  as  fuel  but  you  have 
 to  make  your  own  decisions  too  because 
 you  do 
 requires  a  dedication  that  will 
 eliminate  a  lot  of  things  from  your  life 
 that  some  people  enjoy  and  think  are 
 important  dude  and  also  when  you  when  I 
 took  the  road  cuz  I  knew  what  I  was 
 doing  when  you  when  you  take  that  road 
 and  you  just  don't  want  to  just  fit  in 
 it's  a  lonely  road  it's  a  lonely  road 
 and  you  get  a  lot  of  haters  man  and  like 
 I  tell  people  all  the  time 
 man  if  I  can  walk  on  water  [ __ ] 
 would  say  because  I  couldn't  swim 
 tell  that  right  the  [ __ ]  now  yeah  tell 
 that  right  now  and  and  this  is  a  true 
 statement  I  used  to  get  so  mad  like  I 
 said  about  this  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  man  but  I 
 sat  back  one  day  I  was  like  you  know 
 what  all  these  people  hating  on  me  man 
 like  I  have  a  guy  who's  trying  to  who's 
 trying  to  write  a  book  saying  that  I  was 
 telling  people  he's  a  famous  author  like 
 I'll  never  drop  names  dude  I'm  not 
 trying  to  hurt  your  business  but  you're 
 funny  these  people  are  funny  keep  on 
 talking  your  [ __ ]  I  will  absorb  it  and 
 make  a  mixtape  out  of  your  [ __ ]  ass 
 like  I  do  he  tried  to  tell  he  he  was 
 going  to  write  book  that  I  was  telling 
 people  to  run  until  your  kidneys  got 
 [ __ ]  up  that  my  mentality  of  running 
 is  is  I  was  telling  people  I  was  telling 
 people  to  run  into  your  kidneys  got 
 [ __ ]  up  to  run  until  you  get  wbed  up 
 run  until  you  get  wbed  up  that's  he  was 
 going  to  he's  going  to  write  a  book  and 
 the  premise  was  the  way  I  think  compared 
 to  the  way  he  thinks  I  never  told  a 
 [ __ ]  in  my 
 life  I  tell  you  to  do  better  and  go  as 
 far  as  you  can  I  don't  tell  you  to  go 
 until  you  [ __ ]  kill  yourself  until 
 you  get  rabo  but  I  will  tell  you  this 
 Joe  you  will  never  never  in 
 life  meet  a  hater  doing  better  than  you 
 that's  a  fact  ever  so  when  I  [ __ ] 
 realize  that  and  Jennifer  gets  so  mad  at 
 the  lies  she  hears  and  this  and  that 
 because  it  comes  all  through  they  spew 
 it  yeah  I  told  Jennifer  that  [ __ ]  man 
 stop  yeah  [ __ ]  calm  down  bro  don't 
 stop  sending  me  that  [ __ ]  100%  factual 
 there's  there  we  were  we  were  talking 
 about  in  the  bathroom  earlier  I  was  like 
 you  got  a  amount  of  bandwidth  in  your 
 mind  yep  whatever  that  those  units  are 
 let  called  a  hundred  hundred  of  of  those 
 things  in  your  mind  the  moment  you  start 
 entertaining  haters  you  start  reading 
 comments  you're  stealing  your  bandwidth 
 that  you  could  apply  to  your  loved  ones 
 that  you  could  apply  to  the  thing  that 
 you  love  to  do  that  you  could  apply  to 
 making  your  life  better  you're  stealing 
 from  yourself  when  you  pay  attention 
 like  I  was  talking  about  clearing  that 
 space  out  yeah  and  that  space  allows  you 
 to  make  more  room  for  what's  important 
 in  your  life  yeah  if  your  mind's  still 
 clutter  man  you  can't  do  [ __ ]  there's 
 also  a  thing  about  you  being  a  public 
 person  being  a  public  person  now  you 
 have  access  to  way  more  haters  than  the 
 the 
 average  the  average  person  knows  a  few 
 haters  maybe  if  you're  a  good-look  woman 
 and  you  got  some  [ __ ]  in  the  office 
 like  to  talk  [ __ ]  about  you  or  if  you're 
 a  guy  who's  like  you  know  getting  after 
 it  early  and  being  disciplined  and  you 
 you  you  make  people  intimidated  by  your 
 ambition  you're  going  to  have  some 
 haters  you're  going  to  be  people  lying 
 about  you  there's  going  to  be  but  you 
 have  no  idea  what  it's  like  to  be  a 
 public  person  like 
 yourself  and  the  kind  of  haters  that  you 
 must  experience  because  if  you  paid 
 attention  to  them  all  day  long  you  would 
 have  no  time  for  anything  else  no  I 
 never  get  in  2013  when  I  was  first  you 
 know  Jennifer  knows  about  this  [ __ ]  I 
 cussed  everybody  we  had  this  [ __ ] 
 round  table  and  every  was  like  man  he 
 have  such  a  great  story  you  need  to  tell 
 it  you  need  to  get  on  social  media  and 
 blah  blah  blah  I  cussed  everybody  out 
 [ __ ]  you  I'm  not  [ __ ]  going  on  that 
 [ __ ]  [ __ ]  that's  a  bunch  of  [ __ ] 
 [ __ ]  lying  it's  it's  the 
 devil  and  the  second  I  [ __ ]  got  on 
 that  [ __ ]  dude  it  is  the  [ __ ]  devil 
 Instagram  and  social  media  man  I  had 
 this  [ __ ]  kid  man  who  [ __ ] 
 literally  the  reason  I  talk  about  haters 
 so  much  is  this  little  boy  his  parents 
 reached  out  to  me  and  he  was  getting  so 
 much  hate  at  school  and  we  get  so  many 
 emails  I  can't  check  them  all  and  but  I 
 get  to  them  but  later  on  much  like  two 
 or  three  months  later  so  this  guy  wrote 
 us  and  this  kid  was  having  a  hard  time 
 with  bullies  and  when  I  got  to  his  email 
 I  got  to  it  called  his  family  up  said 
 hey  what's  going  on  you  know  David  Gaga 
 they  were  all  happy  to  hear  it  he  had 
 killed 
 himself  so 
 like  I  in  the  back  of  my  [ __ ]  mind 
 and  what  hurt  me  the  most  was  when  I 
 read  the  [ __ ] 
 email  and  uh  Oho  [ __ ]  I  get  my  [ __ ] 
 together  I  wasn't  gonna  bring  this  [ __ ] 
 up  I  I  I  I  read  the  email  and  they  said 
 he  can  you  know  you  can  help  her  son 
 know  our  son  really  admires  you  that's 
 why  I  um  I'm  so  I'm  I'm  I'm  I'm  very 
 vocal  for  a  lot  of 
 reasons  but  I  have  to  be  strong  because 
 I  know  a  lot  of  people  aren't  so  you 
 know  that's  why  don't  cower  from  [ __ ] 
 you  know  at  all  you  want  to  [ __ ]  you 
 know  I've  I'll  take  on  whatever  whatever 
 challenge  is  in  front  of  me  I  take  it  on 
 because  a  lot  of  people  don't  have  that 
 that  courage  and  it's  hard  to  be  brave 
 it's  [ __ ]  hard  to  speak  up  for  what 
 you  believe  in  and  they  they  wrote  this 
 great  email  to  me  and  they  want  me  to 
 talk  to  their  son  son  was  a  big  follower 
 of  mine  and  he  uh  so  I  called  he's  like 
 yeah  and  it  was  a  silent  a  very  silent 
 um 
 pause  and  they  told  me  what  happened  and 
 um  he  hung  himself  and  I  was  like  it  was 
 [ __ ]  up  so  you  know  that's  why  another 
 reason  I  hate  I  hate  being  a  public 
 figure  because  it's  not  a  public  figure 
 that  I  am  like  it's  funny  um  I  hang 
 around  some  people  who  are  real  public 
 figures  you  know  like 
 celebrities  and  I  have  people  coming  to 
 me  first  like  I'm  talking  of  famous 
 [ __ ]  and  people  come  to  me  me 
 first  and  and  they  want  to  share  their 
 story  in  their  life  with  me  about  how 
 they  changed  and  that's  a  massive 
 responsibility  that  people  don't 
 understand 
 like  um  when  they  come  to  you  and  they 
 share  the  demons  that  they've  gone 
 through  and  and  the  hard  [ __ ]  the 
 hardships  that  they've  gone  through  and 
 um  and  they  say  you  and  your  book  and 
 and  what  you've  done  and  your  social 
 media  page  that's  why  I  make  sure  I  want 
 to  go  at  people  so  hard  Joe  sometimes 
 man  for  [ __ ]  talking  their  [ __ ]  to  me 
 man  and  lying  [ __ ]  I  make  sure  that  my 
 social  media  only  has  like  let's  let's 
 [ __ ]  get  it  today  let's  [ __ ]  let's 
 [ __ ]  get  they  go  man  why  don't  you 
 follow  anybody  man  I'm  not  into  that 
 [ __ ]  dude  I  I  I  want  you  [ __ ]  to 
 understand  dude  I'm  your  biggest  [ __ ] 
 for  for  you  who  don't  who  aren't 
 bitching  and  whining  and  complaining  I'm 
 your  biggest  [ __ ] 
 cheerleader  I  want  to  see  you  do  great  I 
 I  want  to  see  do  great  and  a  lot  of  that 
 [ __ ]  comes  from  that  [ __ ]  email  from 
 that  kid  who  killed  himself  that  I  got 
 to  like  two  or  three  months  too  late  and 
 that  [ __ ]  [ __ ]  every  day  I  [ __ ] 
 wake  up  I'm  like  [ __ ]  man  [ __ ]  I  gotta 
 be  honest  I  gota  be  right  I  gota  be 
 better  and  that's  that's  when  you  know 
 that  when  when  you're  trying  to  do  your 
 best  your  life  sucks  and  people  don't 
 get  that  when  you're  trying  to  have  the 
 best  character  when  you're  trying  not  to 
 [ __ ]  lie  and  you're  trying  not  to 
 [ __ ]  put  people  down  and  you're 
 trying  to  live  you're  trying  to  set  the 
 standard  when  you're  trying  to  be  the 
 standard  and  that  standard  is  I  you  know 
 there's  so  much  going  wrong  and  going 
 off  in  this  world  that  if  people  can 
 focus  on  themselves  being  better  versus 
 throwing  hate  and  [ __ ]  all  this  [ __ ] 
 that  happens  out  there  and  people 
 talking  [ __ ]  running  that's  why  I  won't 
 mention  no  [ __ ]  names  not 
 trying  to  hurt  you  man  but  I'm  trying  to 
 be  the  standard  and  sometimes  life  is 
 just  not  fun  when  you're  like  can't  do 
 that  can't  say  that  gota  watch  out  for 
 that  yeah  I  I  gotta  wake  up  today  I 
 gotta  I  gotta  grind  because  there  may  be 
 a  [ __ ]  out  there  that  sees  me  in 
 their  [ __ ]  car  that  says  all  right 
 I'm  going  to  go  home  and  be  better  today 
 so  all  these  things  are  in  my  [ __ ] 
 mind  every  [ __ ]  day  I  wake  up  every 
 [ __ ]  day  and  I  you  know  so  you  know  I 
 try  to  get  to  emails  I  it's  it's  me  and 
 Jennifer  and  but  yeah  you  know  people 
 [ __ ]  it's  it's  crazy  man  people  come 
 to  me  tell  me  their  stories  man  it's 
 [ __ ]  very  humbling  that  this  kid  that 
 came  from  [ __ ]  nothing  is  now  helping 
 people  who  you  know  like  you  know  know 
 it's  is  funny  and  people  call  me  crazy  a 
 lot  man  you're  so  [ __ ]  crazy  but  what 
 you  do  I  look  at  him  straight  in  the  eye 
 and  I  say  man  I'm  not  crazy  I'm  just  not 
 you  I'm  just  not  who  you  are  who  you 
 want  to  be  I  have  a  responsibility  man 
 and  I  gotta  [ __ ]  take  that  seriously 
 well  people  like  to  look  at  people  that 
 are  pushing  further  than  them  and  harder 
 than  them  like  there's  something  wrong 
 with  you  yep  you  must  be  crazy  got  be 
 crazy  gota  be  crazy  I  love  crazy  though 
 my  favorite  people  are  crazy 
 yes  you  know  but  I  don't  I  don't  look  at 
 it  as  a  negative  I  look  at  it  as  a 
 strength  it  is  I  I  see  a  person  who's 
 willing  to  go  to  that  dark  matter  place 
 I  go  oh  I  like  that  oh  yeah  I  like  that 
 but  you  went  there  during  sober  October 
 man  you  went  there  you  went  there  so 
 how'  that  feel  man  when  you  [ __ ]  were 
 going  into  those  Journeys  into  those 
 compartments  well  what  I  like  about  it 
 is  that  you  had  to  do  it  every  day  you 
 know  and  so  I  just  every  day  would  you 
 know  know  it  was  coming  go  hey  all  right 
 here  we  go  time  to  get  going  and  every 
 day  just  get  after  it  in  some  crazy  way 
 one  of  my  favorite  things  is  the  thing 
 that  I  hate  the  most  it's  airdine 
 Sprints  I  do  those  Tabata  sprints  on  the 
 airdine  machine  oh  the  [ __ ]  Echo  Bike 
 yeah  the  Echo  Bike  from  Rogue  20  second 
 Sprints  10  second  rest  20  second  do 
 cycles  of  eight  so  eight  rounds  of  that 
 and  then  I  would  do  another  one  and 
 another  one  and  another  one  I  was  doing 
 an  hour  at  that  that's  [ __ ]  brutal 
 so  hard  but  it  but  when  it  was  done  I'm 
 standing  in  a  puddle  I'm  completely 
 drenched  but  that  feeling  of  getting 
 through  this  cu  the  last  Cycles  when 
 you're  doing  like  and  you  look  like  cuz 
 the  Rogue  bike  will  show  you  like  you've 
 done  three  which  means  you  have  to  you 
 have  to  do  five  more  of  these  Sprints 
 and  that  10  seconds  just  non-existent 
 she 
 like  and  then  tekken's 
 like  it's  it's  so  quick  and  then  you're 
 back  at  it  again  those  last  ones  are  so 
 hard  but  when  you  get  through  it  the 
 rest  of  the  day  is  so  much  better  that's 
 like  fight  training  man  because  the 
 month  of  November  all  I've  been  doing  is 
 drinking  really  oh  man  I've  been  working 
 out  still  working  out  but  we're  doing  a 
 lot  of  drinking  and  I'm  like  this  I  got 
 to  stop  so  I  woke  up  today  because 
 today's  December  1st  I'm  like  I'm  not 
 drinking  this  month  I'll  have  a  glass  of 
 wine  on  Christmas  or  something  like  that 
 but  this  month  I'm  back  to  the  Grind  are 
 you  cuz  yeah  yeah  cuz  I  enjoyed  October 
 this 
 suck  when  it's  over  it's  life  is  better 
 well  you  know  you  just  got  to  get 
 through  the  suck  that's  right  and  then 
 life  is  better  but  the  thing  that  gets 
 me  is  the  level  of  I  don't  give  a  [ __ ] 
 and  anxi  the  less  the  the  lack  of 
 anxiety  that  comes  after  you  work  out 
 every  day  is  so  worth  the  workout  you're 
 so  calm  so  calm  the  only  thing  that 
 changes  your  [ __ ] 
 DNA  is  discipline  yes  dis  the  only  thing 
 that  changes  your  DNA  man  is  the  only 
 thing  only  thing  man  you  could  be 
 [ __ ]  so  [ __ ]  up  and  I  realized  that 
 man  I  was  like  man  the  only  thing  that 
 changeed  my  DNA  is  discipline  know  what 
 I'm  saying  I've  Incorporated  a  new  thing 
 that  I  was  telling  you  where  I  get  up 
 first  thing  in  the  morning  I  get  in  the 
 cold  plunge  cuz  I  was  doing  the  cold 
 plunge  after  I  did  the  sauna  and  it's  a 
 little  easier  cuz  the  sauna  sucks  right 
 but  you  know  when  that  20  minutes  is  up 
 or  25  minutes  is  up  and  then  you  get  in 
 that  cold  the  cold  sucks  but  it  doesn't 
 suck  suck  as  much  as  when  you're  cold 
 and  then  you  get  in  the  cold  so  when  I 
 wake  up  in  the  morning  I  don't  dress 
 warm  I  wear  my  [ __ ]  underwear  and  I 
 go  outside  and  it's  40°  this  morning  and 
 I  walk  out  and  I  lift  the  lid  on  that 
 morosgo  cold  plunge  and  I  see  the 
 [ __ ]  ice  floating  up  in  there  and 
 every  day  I  climb  in  that's  brutal  and  I 
 just  get  in  there  for  3  minutes  in  the 
 morning  and  then  I  work  out  that's 
 [ __ ]  brutal  because  I  read  this  thing 
 um  I'll  send  it  to  you  Jamie  but  I  read 
 this  thing  where  uh  they've  been  doing 
 studies  on  what  happens  to  people  Andrew 
 huberman  and  I  actually  discussed  this 
 and  huberman's  a  very  interesting  guy 
 but  um  it's  about  the  benefits  of  cold 
 plunge  before  you 
 actually  work  out  really  yeah  cuz 
 there's  a  benefit  after  you  work  out  in 
 terms  of  reduction  of  inflammation  but 
 what  they're  saying  is  you  shouldn't  do 
 it  right  after  you  lift  weights  got  it 
 got  it  because  then  Muses  yeah  it  it 
 actually  decreases  the  hypertrophy  so 
 you  don't  gain  as  much  mass  or  gain  as 
 much  strength  but  there's  some  benefit 
 to  doing  it  before  you  work  out  I  think 
 there's  a  a  link  involved  in  that 
 too  so  anyway  this  is  a 
 guy  uh  who's  talking  about  prostate 
 specific  antigen  blood  te  test  came  back 
 uh  very  high  and  everyone  said  that  he 
 had  to  get  a  biopsy  and  he  said  the 
 story  I've  heard  about  old  older  men 
 getting  biopsies  in  prostate  ectomies 
 sounded  like  nightmares  to  him  so  he 
 decided  to  try  to  manage  his  PSA  with 
 ketosis  and  Ice  baths  so  it  worked  his 
 PSA  dropped  from  over  seven  to  less  than 
 one  and  along  the  way  a  funny  thing 
 happened  to  his  testosterone  it  went 
 through  the  roof  to  1140  which  is  crazy 
 high  his  he  said  my  urologist  didn't 
 believe  me  he  thought  I  must  be  juicing 
 so  he  had  my  luteinizing  hor  hormones 
 tested  2  sure  enough  8.9  is  off  the 
 charts  for  a  fat  guy  in  his  50s  he  said 
 then  I  did  a  research  and  I  discovered  a 
 Japanese  study  from  1991  that  showed  the 
 secret  was  exercising  after  your  ice 
 bath  it's  the  opposite  of  what  everybody 
 says  to  do  which  is  exactly  how  I  got 
 this  far  in  the  first  place  he  said  now 
 I'm  stuck  with  the  tea  levels  of  an 
 oversex  19yearold  I'm  not  complaining 
 damn  but  so  this  is  the  thing  that  um 
 people  realizing  now  there's  some 
 extreme  benefit  to 
 heavyduty  S  here  this  extreme  benefit  to 
 heavy  duty  cold  exposure  right  and  then 
 you  force  your  body  to  heat  up  and  then 
 you  work 
 out  there  so  so  you  know  I'm  trying  that 
 now  and  I've  only  done  it  three  days  in 
 a  row  well  how's  it  working  it's  working 
 it's  hard  but  the  the  the  but  part  of  it 
 is  just  the  the  fact  that  you  have  to  do 
 it  in  the  like  I'm  not  giving  myself  any 
 mornings  off  so  I  have  that's  how  I 
 start  my  day  now  whereas  before  I  was 
 working  out  so  the  workout  I  ease  myself 
 into  the  workout  get  on  the  bike  warm  up 
 jump  a  little  rope  start  the  kettle  bell 
 routine  do  all  the  things  you  got  to  do 
 but  now  it's  just  right  into  the  suck  so 
 it's  it's  harder  I  tell  you  right  now 
 man  the  [ __ ]  cold  being  in  cold  water 
 cold  ice  water  it  literally  is  the  one 
 thing  that  makes  you  question  everything 
 when  you're  going  through  hard  training 
 and  [ __ ]  like  that 
 you  know  I've  been  through  a  lot  of 
 different  training  the  military  and  that 
 cold  water  it  definitely  many  dreams  die 
 while 
 suffering  that  should  be  a  t-shirt  many 
 dreams  die  while  suffering  my  friend 
 that's  so  true  I  talk  about  it  man  like 
 this  this  [ __ ]  guys  getting  that 
 water  and  you  see  their  [ __ ]  eyes 
 roll  back  and  I'm  like  oh  yeah  many 
 dreams  die  while  suffering  friend  yeah 
 [ __ ]  I  was  trying  to  talk  to  Jamie  about 
 it  Jamie  it's  [ __ ]  cold 
 I'll  do  cold  it's  just  like  there's  a 
 level  of  cold  I  want  to  ease  myself  into 
 it  I  don't  want  to  just  start  in  the 
 worst  that  might  be  the  best  way  to  do 
 it  Jamie  yeah  that's  what  tell  got  jump 
 in  that  I  did  I  just  I  just  couldn't  go 
 like  below  my 
 knees 
 yeah  there  man  hey  man  once  that  pecker 
 gets  cold  boy  it's  real  I  know  I  know 
 yeah  it's  all  real  I  go  right  up  to  the 
 chin  I  want  that  water  right  there  oh 
 that's  legit  right  there  man  if  it's 
 real  legit  you  go  under  Hicks  and  Gracie 
 he  puts  a  snorkel  on  really  yeah  Hixon 
 gets  in  that  water  for  a  couple  minutes 
 under  the  water  with  the  snorkel  on  he 
 likes  that  [ __ ]  huh  Hixon  hixon's  an 
 intense  [ __ ]  So  speaking  of  that 
 who's  the  best  ever  oh  the  best  ever  in 
 MMA  ever  an  MMA  it's  hard  to  say  there's 
 a  lot  of  candidates  you  know  I've  always 
 said  Mighty  Mouse  is  one  of  my  Best  Bets 
 CU  he  was  so  goddamn  good  and  he's  still 
 so  godamn  good  now  but  now  he's  fighting 
 in  one  FC  but  he  was  a  flyweight 
 Champion  for  a  long  time  and  his  he  was 
 the  highest  level  of  expression  of  mixed 
 martial  arts  ability  that  I'd  ever  seen 
 but  he's  also  fighting  guys  that  are 
 much  lighter  they're  125  pounds  you  know 
 everyone's  very  quick  but  he  was  just  so 
 skillful  but  then  there's  Jon  Jones  Jon 
 Jones  really  never  lost  that's  a  nasty 
 [ __ ]  he's  a  nasty  [ __ ] 
 and  you  know  really  Jon  Jones  [ __ ]  off 
 you  want  to  talk  about  a  guy  who  just 
 did  it  by  talent  and  will 
 Jon  Jones  beat  Alexander  Guston  without 
 training  unbeli  basically  didn't  train 
 there's  a  few  guys  like  that  there's  a 
 guy  named  Ryan  span  who's  out  there 
 right  now  who  just  [ __ ]  up  Dominic 
 Reyes  and  Dominic  Reyes  was  the  one  guy 
 who  took  Jon  Jones  to  the  Limit  Dominic 
 Reyes  uh  went  on  a  series  of  losses 
 after  that  fight  but  he  had  this  fight 
 with  Jon  Jones  and  took  Jon  Jones  to  the 
 [ __ ]  limit  and  a  lot  of  people 
 thought  he  won  that  decision  then  he 
 went  on  after  that  fight  got  got  knocked 
 out  by  Yan  bovich  who  became  the  light 
 heavyweight  champion  got  knocked  out  by 
 Yuri  prasa  and  then  just  got  lit  up  by 
 Ryan  span  and  Ryan  span  is  this  guy 
 who's  always  been  Ultra  Ultra  talented 
 right  but  just  was  always  afraid  of 
 running  out  of  gas  didn't  train  didn't 
 really  put  in  camps  just  had  a  lot  of 
 ability  and  a  lot  of  technique  right  in 
 his  last  fight  he  fought  Dominic  Reyes 
 and  he  put  in  a  full  training  camp  for 
 the  first  time  ever  and  just  [ __ ] 
 Dominic  Reyes  up  just  lit  him  up  like  a 
 Christmas  tree  in  the  first  round  and 
 put  him  away  so  you're  talking  about  a 
 guy  who  beat  you  know  many  people's  eyes 
 should  have  won  a  decision  against  John 
 Jones  right  and  then  Ryan  span  just 
 takes  him  out  in  the  first  round  easy 
 quick  because  he  finally  worked  hard 
 well  there's  something  about  that  full 
 training  camp  man  yes  there's  something 
 about  going  out  no  phone  yes  up  in  the 
 [ __ ]  mountains  away  from  civilization 
 away  from  the  bacon  and  eggs  the  silk 
 sheets  the  [ __ ]  five  star  resorts  the 
 [ __ ]  everybody  knowing  you  sign 
 autographs  and  [ __ ]  Dark  Matter  dude 
 Dark  Matter  like  a  [ __ ]  the 
 further  you  [ __ ]  drive  out  your  house 
 and  start  going  up  in  that  [ __ ] 
 Mountain  Man  you  start 
 to  that  [ __ ]  mind  starts  to  click 
 over  man  you  get  a  full  Camp  up  in  some 
 [ __ ]  Dark  Matter  Place  yep  it's 
 [ __ ]  over  bro  there's  a  reason  why  so 
 many  guys  would  go  up  to  Big  Bear  that's 
 where  genady  Golovkin  used  to  go  up 
 there  can't  Brea  in  that  mother  Ali  used 
 to  go  to  the  Poconos  Ali  or  um  Tyson 
 rather  would  go  to  the  cat  skills  a  lot 
 of  guys  would  do  that  lot  of  evil  up  in 
 them  [ __ ]  mountains  boring  cat  skills 
 it's  also  this  nature  oh  yeah  cuz  like 
 nature  doesn't  give  a  [ __ ]  about  you  and 
 there's  something  you  realize  when

 about  you  up  there  no  one  there's  no 
 press  no  one's  watching  that's  a 
 beautiful  thing  man  that's  when  you

 it's  only  business  and  khabib  says  you 
 tired  let's 
 talk  Jesus  dude  he  brought  that  [ __ ]  to 
 another  level  man  yeah  well  he  used  that 
 as  fuel  he  took  no  [ __ ]  mental  Aid 
 stations  in  the  training  camp  no  no  no 
 no  he  was  a  bad  [ __ ]  and  then 
 when  his  father  died  he  told  his  mother 
 he  was  going  to  fight  one  more  time  and 
 that's  it  so  he's  in  his  prime  still 
 right  now  he's  in  his  physical  prime  and 
 he's  like  told  his  mom  he's  GNA  he's 
 done  he's  not  coming  back  you  don't 
 think  well  his  Protege  is  Islam  ma  makev 
 who's  now  the  new  UFC  lightweight 
 champion  and  Islam  is  as  good  as  him  in 
 that  same  realm  w  i  mean  remains  to  be 
 seen  whether  or  not  Islam  can  have  a 
 Reign  the  way  he  did  but  he  just  beat 
 Charles  Oliva  was  one  of  the  best  ever 
 and  he  just  ran  through  him  to  win  the 
 title  that's  a  bad  dude  too  man  ol  is  a 
 bad  [ __ ]  and  olera  is  an 
 interesting  case  too  because  Ola  used  to 
 be  kind  of  a  quitter  yeah  I  know  he  kind 
 of  fell  apart  in  many  fights  early  in 
 his  career  and  then  he  had  the  birth  of 
 his  daughter  and  then  changed  his 
 [ __ ]  entire  life  changed  the  way  he 
 fought  changed  his  mentality  changed  his 
 his  discipline  and  his  focus  and  then 
 became  this  [ __ ]  who  just 
 dominating  everybody  olera  I  believe 
 he's  33  see  find  out  with  if  that's 
 accurate  so  are  there  some  are  there 
 some  old  Fighters  right  now  who  are 
 still  kicking 
 ass  yes  yam  bovich  um  Glover  toer 
 just  lost  the  light  heavyweight  title  at 
 42  he  won  it  at  42  and  then  lost  it  to 
 Yuri  brovka  in  a  very  very  close  fight 
 yeah  he's  33  olera  is  33  you  know  what's 
 funny  about  that  man  but  I  see  these 
 older  guys  who  are  still  [ __ ] 
 grinding  hard  people  ask  about  father 
 time  yeah  father  time  doesn't  get  you 
 man  it's  father 
 fatigue  it's  father  fatigue  man  like  I 
 see  these  guys  who  have  been  in  sports 
 for  a  long  time  fighting  or  basketball 
 football  whatever  it  is  yeah  and  it's 
 that  grind 
 it's  that  everyday  waking  up  grind  it's 
 not  it's  it's  not  father  time  man  it's 
 it's  the  fact  that  you  know  I  got  to  go 
 do  it  again  yeah  I  got  to  do  it  again  so 
 a  lot  of  these  guys  are  fighting  father 
 fatigue  and  they're  doing  a  good  job  of 
 doing  it  I  think  there's  many  factors 
 there's  father  fatigue  there's  father 
 enthusiasm  that's  right  but  then  there's 
 also  injuries  there's  you  so  many  of 
 these  guys  are  fighting  with  [ __ ]  up 
 backs  and  [ __ ]  up  knees  and  [ __ ]  up 
 elbows  and  [ __ ]  up  hands  and  you  don't 
 know  that  when  you  see  them  because  they 
 look  jacked  they  look  ripped  right  in 
 their  head  they  know  I  got  to  be  careful 
 if  I  move  to  the  side  on  my  right  side 
 cuz  my  knee's  [ __ ]  I  know  all  about 
 that  I  got  to  be  careful  if  I  get  kicked 
 in  the  legs  because  this  is  [ __ ]  I  got 
 to  be  yeah  and  there's  a  lot  of  guys 
 that  also  been  they  taking  too  many 
 shots  and  they  can't  take  a  punch 
 anymore  right  that  happens  to  guys  and 
 then  you  see  they  get  dinged  once  and 
 they  get  wobbly  where  so  what  the  [ __ ] 
 happens  with  that  man  I  started  seeing 
 guys  who  [ __ ]  been  getting  hit  a  lot 
 yeah  they  can't  take  a  hit  anymore  man 
 like  they'll  [ __ ]  go  out  quick  lot  of 
 speculation  and  um  one  of  the  things 
 they  say  is  that  they  believe  that  at 
 certain  point  in  time  your  brain  tries 
 to  protect  you  from  the  punishment  and 
 just  shut  off  like  that  your  your  your 
 body  realizes  like  this  dude  is  too 
 strong  mentally  he's  too  tough  and  he'll 
 just  absorb  shots  and  is  just  ruining 
 our  brain  so  when  you  get  hit  your  brain 
 is  like  check  please  wow  and  your  brain 
 will  shut  off  and  then  the  other  that's 
 a  optimistic  perspective  got  it  the 
 other  less  optimistic  perspective  is 
 that  you  are  destroying  your  mind  and 
 that  your  mind  is  simply  not  resilient 
 anymore  and  you  can't  take  a  shot 
 anymore  because  you've  damaged  all  the 
 connective  tissue  that's  holding  the 
 [ __ ]  brain  in  place  and  you've  also 
 created  so  much  CTE  and  so  much  swelling 
 and  so  that  one  shot  can  take  you  out 
 there's  also  on  top  of  that  one  of  the 
 big  problems  with  MMA  is  the  weight 
 cutting  so  the  weight  cutting  is  which 
 what  everybody  does  they  they  drain 
 themselves  24  hours  before  the  fight 
 when  in  say  oh  he  weighs  170  lbs  like 
 guys  like  kamaro  Usman  who's  giant  for 
 170  he's  170  for  like  20  minutes  how 
 much  does  he  weigh  like  walking  the 
 street  200  lb  200  lb  easy  so  does  he 
 come  back  in  the  ring  about  190  200  he's 
 in  the90s  for  sure  yeah  lean  as  [ __ ] 
 shredded  is  a  [ __ ]  but 
 dehydrated  like  hell  to  make  170  there's 
 he's  not  ever  really  170  wow  he's  170  be 
 like  totally  sucked  up  I  mean  also 
 cramping  you  know  it's  terrible  to  do 
 that  24  hours  before  you  have  a  cage 
 fight  is  so  crazy  [ __ ]  up  so  those 
 take  a  toll  so  if  you're  35  37  39  all 
 these  guys  that  have  been  doing  that 
 their  whole  life  every  time  you  cut  that 
 weight  it  takes  a  little  chip  off  the 
 old  block  every  time  every  time  it  takes 
 it's  another  chop  into  the  tree  trunk 
 got  it  just  your  foundation  and  it's 
 just  little  minor  things  every  training 
 camp  you  go  through  you  know  can  you  do 
 another  one  you  know  your  back  is  [ __ ] 
 up  you  get  out  of  bed  like  this 
 like  it's  like  little  micro  injuries 
 that  are  constantly  piling  up  you  know 
 we  were  talking  about  hickon  Gracie 
 earlier  Hixon  can  can't  really  even  roll 
 hard  anymore  he's  in  the  60s  and  he's 
 got  these  injuries  all  over  his  back  is 
 all  [ __ ]  up  it's  like  all  those  years 
 of  Jiu-Jitsu  that  Gracie  shit's  no  joke 
 though  M  them  [ __ ]  that  family 
 they  change  the  world  the  world  this 
 little  160  lb  [ __ ]  man  this 
 little  [ __ ]  can't  even  see  him 
 under  some  of  these  fat  [ __ ] 
 this  [ __ ]  finger  finger  [ __ ] 
 locking  you  out  man  [ __ ]  get  you 
 in  a  pinky  lock  bro  like  where  is  he 
 tapping  from  why  is  he  tapping  I  can't 
 even  see  you  know  Gracie  got 
 [ __ ]  a  pinky 
 loot  this  [ __ ]  was  nasty  dude  T  they 
 taught  the  world  Jiu-Jitsu  the  world 
 didn't  know  Jiu-Jitsu  is  the  only 
 martial  art  that  people  had  ever 
 experienced  that  did  what  was  advertised 
 right  what  was  advertised  was  that  a 
 small  skillful  person  could  beat  a 
 larger  stronger  opponent  who  didn't  know 
 the  techniques  well  he  proved  it  he 
 proved  it  boy  Gracie  proved  it  in  the 
 UFC  and  he  changed  martial  arts  forever 
 and  that  that  family's  probably  the  most 
 consequential  the  most  important 
 significant  family  in  the  history  of 
 martial  arts  the  Gracie  family  changed 
 martial  arts  worldwide  it's  funny  man 
 about  you  know  there's  so  many  people 
 out  here  who  uh  who  are  very  successful 
 and  they  talk  about  I  mean  Super  money 
 great  familyship  they  talk  about  that 
 that  they're  missing  something  that 
 there's  something  in  their  life  that 
 they're  missing  and  they  and  they  talk 
 to  me  about  that  [ __ ]  and  I  mentioned 
 the  Gracies  it  seemed  like  they  they  had 
 this  it  was  about  money  it  was  about 
 nothing  man  they're  like  Grassroots 
 [ __ ]  and  that's  what  I  always 
 tell  people  that  they're  missing  that 
 they're  missing  that  desire 
 like  those  guys  had  a  passion  and  a 
 [ __ ]  obsess  that's  the  word  Obsession 
 Obsession  and  I  guarantee  you  man  those 
 [ __ ]  don't  have  those 
 conversations  I  feel  like  I'm  missing 
 something  right  they're  not  they're  not 
 missing  [ __ ]  dude  no  no  they  they  they 
 got  it  figured  out  man  well  Hixon  in 
 particular  cuz  Hixon  was  Ho's  older 
 brother  who  was  everybody  says  is  the 
 greatest  of  all  time  really  from  that 
 era  yeah  he  was  there  was  never  been  a 
 time  other  than  today  there's  a  time 
 right  now  with  Gordon  Ryan  which  is  very 
 rare  it's  very  rare  where  someone  comes 
 along  and  everybody  says  this  is  the 
 baddest  [ __ ]  alive  no  if  ANS  or 
 questions  about  and  back  then  when  Hixon 
 was  in  his  prime  you  ask  any  black  belt 
 anywhere  in  the  world  they're  like 
 hixon's  the  man  hixon's  the  man  and  he 
 was  a  yogi  he  all  this  crazy  breath  work 
 that  he  would  do  he  figured  out  the 
 physical  as  well  as  the  mental  far 
 beyond  where  everybody  else  was  willing 
 to  track  travel  and  there's  a  great 
 documentary  people  are  interested  in 
 Hickson  Gracie  called  choke  hixon's  been 
 on  the  podcast  a  couple  of  times  but 
 there's  a  great  documentary  called  choke 
 that  followed  him  when  he  was  in  his 
 prime  in  the  1990s  competing  in  Japan 
 and  uh  one  of  the  things  he  does  in  that 
 documentary  he  gets  in  a  frozen  glacial 
 River  and  he  just  sits  down  and  he's 
 meditating  In  this  River  up  to  his  neck 
 of  this  [ __ ]  30  Dee  water  just 
 washing  over  him  and  he's  just  be  Talent 
 bro  he's  like  thank  you  my  Lord  thank 
 you  my  Lord  and  he's  just  like  just 
 taking  it  all  in  it's  beyond  Talent 
 that's  badass  there  there's  so  much 
 involved  there's  Talent  there's 
 discipline  there's  the  Mind  focus  and 
 there's  also  the  Brilliance  of  his 
 ability  to  interpret  and  understand 
 technique  right  there  was  so  many  things 
 that's  badass  and  this  is  the  the  case 
 with  Gordon  Ryan  today  who's  arguably 
 the  greatest  of  all  time  and  Gordon  is  a 
 lot  bigger  than  everybody  that  was  you 
 know  like  Hixon  was  at  his  prime  was 
 about  200  lbs  Gordon's  like  240  and  you 
 know  Gordon  is  utilizing  modern  training 
 methods  and  365  days  a  year  he  trains 
 doesn't  take  any  days  off  this  is  Hixon 
 in  the  the  Frozen  glacial 
 River  that's  his  brother  hoer  who's  also 
 one  of  the  greats  that  that's  that 
 Gracie  family  man  never  been  a  family 
 like  never  been  a  family  like  it  in 
 martial  arts  you  just  have  like  never 
 will  be  Army  of  killers  that's  it  yeah  I 
 mean  look  at  him  snorkel  yep  that's  what 
 he  likes  to  do  is  to  get  under  that 
 water  and  he  does  that  with  a  cold 
 plunge  too  know  what's  what's  crazy  that 
 so  many  people  would  never  understand 
 that  kind  of  discipline  or  that  kind 
 of  that  kind  of  human  being  that  wants 
 to  go  to  the  stratosphere  yeah  they'll 
 never  they'll  always  be  misunderstood 
 man  always  you  can't  even  that's  why  a 
 lot  of  times  when  I  talk  to  people  I 
 can't  I  can't  have  a  conversation  with  a 
 lot  of  people  man  because  you're  going 
 to  walk  away  like  why  do  you  do  it  David 
 why  don't  you  just  take  a  break  you 
 deserve  a  break  David  take  a  nap  that's 
 it  did  you  ever  have  a  piece  of 
 pie  why  don't  you  put  your  feet  up  why 
 rest  a  little  you  think  one  day  you'll 
 get  fat  that's  it  you  should  let 
 yourself  get  fat  dude  you're  being  funny 
 as  [ __ ]  B  the  truest  of  all  [ __ ] 
 statements  oh  yeah  dude  I  don't  do 
 nearly  as  much  as  you  and  I  get  it  dude 
 right  I'm  like  you  you  would  never 
 understand  that's  why  we'll  never  talk 
 yeah  you'll  never  get  it  so  that's  why  I 
 don't  have  conversations  with  people  man 
 those  are  brutal  conversations  with 
 people  that  like  what  I  don't  understand 
 what  your  motivation  is  what  what  are 
 you  chasing  I  haven't  been  on  a  podcast 
 years  you  insecure  where  you  running 
 from  where  you  running  from  David  where 
 you  going  you  know  you  get  there  faster 
 in  a  car  in  the  car  oh  I  get  that  a  lot 
 that's  the  one  I  get  a  lot  I  get  that  a 
 lot  and  and  they're  joking  I'm  like  and 
 I  don't  find  this  [ __ ]  funny  like  you 
 [ __ ]  man  it's  so  dumb  it's  dumb 
 as  [ __ ]  man  but  whenever  you  some 
 someone  who's  that  wild  and  that  far 
 beyond  where  most  people  are  willing  to 
 go  you're  going  to  you're  going  to  run 
 into  normies  well  it's  like 
 [ __ ]  go  into  the  circle  breaker 
 man  and  they  go  in  there  and  start 
 rewiring  their  brain  they  go  in  and  say 
 like  like  like  that  [ __ ]  right 
 there  with  the  snorkel  and  [ __ ]  yeah  oh 
 no  man  I  got  to  put  this  over  here  yeah 
 this  circuit  needs  to  be  there  that 
 needs  to  be  there  you're  totally 
 rewiring  how  the  whole  brain  works  to 
 not  to  not  feel  sorry  for  yourself  to 
 ignore  pain  to  ignore  discomfort  to  push 
 your  place  you  know  to  push  your  mind 
 place  that  people  don't  even  [ __ ] 
 want  to  talk  about  they  can't  fathom  and 
 it's  what  you  talk  about  with  knowledge 
 yep  that's  what  it  is  this  knowledge 
 it's  understanding  of  those  feelings 
 that's  it  and  the  only  way  you 
 understand  that  those  feelings  are  rare 
 they  don't  come  up  all  the  time  all  day 
 long  you  wouldn't  be  able  to  deal  with 
 them  right  so  most  people  don't  know 
 what  to  do  with  those  feelings  they're 
 not  around  them  enough  but  you're  around 
 them  constantly  right  Hixon  was  around 
 them  constantly  it's  like  get  in  those 
 things  then  you  learn  about  them  you  get 
 a  map  of  the  territory  that's  it  you  get 
 a  blueprint  yeah  and  the  second  day 
 surface  when  you're  [ __ ]  getting 
 choked  out  I've  seen  so  many  see  I  love 
 watching  fights  man  cuz  I  I  see  them  and 
 I  start  to  see  okay  you're  in  a  bad 
 situation  man  and  I  see  a  couple  guys 
 getting  ready  to  [ __ ]  tap  yeah  and 
 that  one  second  decision  I  call  it 
 they're  thinking  man  I  got  to  tap  it's 
 like  and  and  and  and  and  you  see  the 
 hand  motion  like  I'm  about  to  tap  and  it 
 go  somewhere  else  not  today  [ __ ] 
 yeah  cuz  I've  been  here  I've  been  here 
 before  I  can  laugh  maybe  this  one  more 
 second  and  this  one  second  may  get  me 
 out  of  this  [ __ ]  and  I  see  how  the  how 
 the  mind  is  evolving  in  that  one  moment 
 that  one  quick  moment  I  see  that  a 
 million  thoughts  went  through  their 
 [ __ ]  mind  and  it  didn't  tap  I'm  going 
 show  you  an  example  of  that  Brian  Ortega 
 versus  Alexander  volkanovski  Alexander 
 volkanovski  almost  gets  Tapped  Out 
 volkanovski  is  the  next  guy  to  fight 
 Islam  makev  and  Islam  makev  is  khabib's 
 protege  that's  a  bad  boy  Alexander 
 volkanovski  is  the  145  pound  champion 
 he's  going  up  to  155  to  try  to  fight 
 makev  and  win  the  title  at  that  weight 
 so  he  fights  this  guy  Brian  Ortega  who 
 is  a  student  of  hon  and  Henry  Gracie  got 
 it  so  he's  an  elite  Black  Belt  and  he 
 gets  Brian  Ortega  gets  vulcanos  in  this 
 Guillotine  choke  mounted  Guillotine 
 choke  which  is  the  nastiest  [ __ ]  ever 
 and  this  guy  is  a  [ __ ]  strangulation 
 expert  and  V  Kowski  is  stuck  give  me 
 some  volume  give  me  some  volume  here  oh 
 my 
 goodness  he  might  go  to  sleep  here's  his 
 mind  the  is  and  he  got  out  see  and  he 
 got  out  he  was  so  close  you  hear 
 Paul  Paul  Felder  saying  he  might  go  to 
 sleep  so  he  almost  catches  him  here  now 
 in  a 
 Dar  and  volovski  winds  up  on  top  he  gets 
 on  top  he  just  starts  Hammer  hammering 
 them  I  mean  this  fight  is  one  of  the 
 best  examples  you  want  to  watch  this 
 fight  you  want  to  talk  about  Will  and 
 Warrior  spirit  this  is  one  of  the  best 
 fights  ever  for  both  guys  cuz  Orga  like 
 going  into  the  fourth  round  you're  like 
 how  is  this  [ __ ]  surviving  and 
 then  he  comes  out  in  the  fifth  round 
 guns  guns  blazing  see  Bol  these  guys 
 just  drained  the  [ __ ]  gas  tank  in 
 this  fight  it  was  an  amazing  amazing 
 amazing  fight  now  what  he  should  have 
 did  after  that  he  should  have  gone  home 
 and  wrote  that  [ __ ]  out  cuz  in  that 
 moment  if  he  could  even  think  about  it 
 the  knowledge  he  gained  in  that  moment 
 Priceless  where  what  was  happening  when 
 you  almost  tapped  what  was  and  I'm  not 
 talking  about  this  surface  conversation 
 that's  beautiful  to  me  that  I  I  study 
 that  [ __ ]  so  much  you  were  in  a  horrible 
 situation  I  know  you  were  like  I  gotta 
 tap  I  got  to  tap  I  gotta  tap  but  if  you 
 break  that  down  really  break  it  down  to 
 the  smallest  molecule  possible  your  mind 
 went  through  so  so  many  things  that 
 allowed  you  to  not  tap  you  got  to  study 
 that  man  that  right  there  is  so  much 
 that's  that's  beautiful  yeah  that's  that 
 that's  Beauty  right  there  at  work  Beauty 
 at  work  it  is  because  for  that  man  I 
 mean  vulcanos  he  walked  out  of  there 
 with  his  [ __ ]  belt  with  the  victory 
 the  cheers  the  Roars  The  Crowd  Goes  back 
 home  he  [ __ ]  did  it  it's  amazing  but 
 he  almost  didn't  I  see  he  got  to  the 
 door  of  death  see  it's  that  one  second 
 decision  that  one  second  decision  I  talk 
 about  this  [ __ ]  right  here  you 
 get  there  and  you  want  to  quit  and  you 
 don't  yeah  and  you  end  up  [ __ ] 
 getting  through  it  man  well  that's  the 
 thing  is  like  your  book  can  give  people 
 if  even  if  they  don't  get  a  map  of  the 
 territory  they're  getting  directions 
 right  you  want  to  go  to  I95  go  about  10 
 miles  down  when  you  see  Woodland  Hills 
 Road  take  a  right  you're  giving  them 
 you're  mind  not  be  giving  them  a  map  cuz 
 I  think  the  map  has  to  be  acquired 
 personally  100%  well  you're  giving  them 
 Direction  that's  it  you're  saying  this 
 is  how  I  got  through  this  is  how  I 
 developed  my  map  MH  people  want  to  hand 
 it  to  me  I  can't  hand  it  to  you  you 
 can't  but  you  can  give  them  something 
 and  I  when  I  texted  you  I  was  in  the 
 middle  of  the  book  I  was  like  I  can  run 
 through  a  [ __ ]  wall  right  now  cuz 
 that's  what  it  feels  like  I  love  that 
 there's  something  about  the  way  you 
 describe  things  and  the  way  you're  so 
 honest  and  so  personal  about 
 it  especially  the  audio  version  of  it 
 and  then  when  you  do  the  podcast  so  the 
 way  the  audio  the  audio  is  a  special 
 treat  because  it's  the  book  and  then 
 with  each  individual  chapter  you  have  a 
 small  podcast  where  you  and  your 
 co-writer  break  down  what  what  what  it 
 was  like  for  you  and  what  was  happening 
 and  and  what  what  you  were  feeling  and 
 what  you  and  it  allows  you  to  do  it  in 
 an  unscripted  way  so  you  could  really 
 and  you're  so  honest  about  it  it  just  it 
 just  gives  you  an  understanding  of  that 
 you  this  discomfort  is  UN  avoidable 
 right  and  then  trying  to  avoid 
 discomfort  just  brings  you  more 
 discomfort  and  you  don't  realize  it  it 
 just  brings  you  this  longterm  dull 
 discomfort  as  opposed  to  the  Searing 
 pain  of  like  mid  struggle  discomfort 
 which  is  what  everybody's  trying  to 
 avoid  but  you're  still  going  to  get 
 discomfort  you're  just  going  to  get  this 
 I  could  have  should  have  would  have  been 
 discomfort  which  is  maybe  worse  you're 
 right  it  might  be  worse  it  just  makes  it 
 a  little  easier  that's  all  that's  all 
 the  repetitions  do  man  it's  not  it 
 doesn't  take  away  the  pain  doesn't  take 
 away  the  suffering  no  you  just  studied 
 it  you  know  it  you  know  how  it  feels 
 yeah  you  know  when  to  breathe  when  not 
 to  breathe  you  know  all  these  different 
 things  you've  been  there  you  visited 
 you've  you  you've  lived  there  for  a  long 
 period  of  time  and  that's  why  I  like 
 this  book  so  much  is  because  can't  hurt 
 me  was  like  a  bachelor's  degree  it  was 
 like  the  surface  level  of  David  gogins 
 and  some  things  that  can  help  you  out 
 this  to  me  is  a  master's  degree  this 
 book  right  here  takes  you  to  another 
 level  of  of  the  mind  and  how  you  think 
 that's  why  I  say  this  ain't  no  [ __ ] 
 self-help  book  this  is  what  the  [ __ ]  are 
 you  doing  with  your  life  book  yeah  and 
 that's  why  that's  so  important  what  are 
 you  doing  with  your  life  man  why  are  you 
 sitting  around  why  are  you  waiting  for 
 [ __ ]  to  happen  it  ain't  going  to  happen 
 like  that  why  are  you  feeling  sorry  for 
 yourself  why  you  waiting  for  that 
 [ __ ]  apology  that's  never  going  to 
 [ __ ]  come  people  sit  around  waiting 
 and  waiting  and  waiting  and  waiting  and 
 blaming  and  blaming  and  they're  waiting 
 with  a  hand  out  yeah  Co  happened  and 
 everybody's  hands  out  now  hands  out  and 
 you  see  how  it  changed  sort  of  the  tone 
 of  the  country  it  did  and  it  made  people 
 feel  entitled  like  someone  deserve  they 
 deserve  something  yep  that's  right  you 
 don't  deserve  [ __ ]  you  don't  deserve 
 [ __ ]  and  that's  the  one  thing  that  I 
 knew  and  I  found  out  the  worst  part  if 
 they  give  you  [ __ ]  you're  going  to  be 
 even  more  miserable  oh  that's  a  true 
 statement  isn't  it  a  true  statement  a 
 true  statement  everybody  wants  the 
 government  to  come  along  and  help  them 
 that's  true  statement  someone  to  come 
 along  and  give  you  things  I  should  get 
 things  you  should  redistribute  wealth 
 you're  not  going  to  be  happy  NOP  you're 
 not  you  got  to  go  get  it  no  you're 
 you're  going  to  always  wonder  W  I  have 
 all  this  [ __ ] 
 money  why  do  I  feel  like  I  said  I  feel 
 like  I'm  missing  something  right  because 
 you  didn't  go  out  and  achieve  it  on  your 
 own  it's  like  a  man  who  inherited  money 
 that's  it  they're  always  missing 
 something  big  time  there's  something 
 wrong  with  them  someone  gift  wrapped  you 
 some  [ __ ]  yeah  and  now  you're  just  a 
 [ __ ]  now  you're  like  a  half  a  man 
 that's  it  you  look  like  a  man  but  you're 
 like  one  of  them  Easter  Bunny  candy 
 things  you  know  those  those  chocolate 
 Easter  Bunnies  that's  it  you  like  you 
 try  to  bite  into  it  your  [ __ ]  sh  has  to 
 [ __ ]  them  shits  up  now  three  hundo  yeah 
 well  I  loved  them  when  they  were  solid 
 when  you  got  a  solid  one  oh  look  at  a 
 Sol  lot  more  calories  lot  more  snacks  in 
 that  [ __ ]  yeah  that's  a  solid  Easter 
 Bunny  but  when  you  bite  into  one  it  just 
 just  destroy  a  [ __ ]  up  your  teeth  [ __ ] 
 this  is  a  [ __ ]  Hollow  one  yes  sir 
 yeah  a  lot  of  people  are  Hollow  Easter 
 Bunnies  a  lot  of  people  are  hollow 
 inside  too  yeah  but  you  don't  have  to  be 
 no  this  is  the  beautiful  thing  of  your 
 story  is  that  you  started  out  [ __ ]  up 
 and  sad  and  couldn't  do  anything  and  you 
 transformed  yourself  so  people  don't 
 think  like  this  guy's  just  always  been 
 hard  from  the  cradle  to  bra  like  you  you 
 you  turned  yourself  into  this  which  is 
 the  real  that's  the  that's  the  story 
 that  gives  people  hope  you  can  truly 
 develop  otherworldly  discipline  right 
 it's  possible  to  develop  other  worldly 
 mental  strength  well  we  change 
 everything  we  change  our  car  we  change 
 our  house  sometimes  we  change  our  wife 
 or  husband  we  change  the  underwear  we 
 change  everything  in  our  lives  change 
 our  hair  change  how  we  look  change 
 everything  but  very  few  of  us  change  how 
 we  think  and  that's  the  one  problem  with 
 with  a  lot  of  people  they're  not  willing 
 to  change  how  they  think  you're  not 
 going  to  evolve  if  you  continue  thinking 
 the  same  [ __ ]  way  so  a  lot  of  people 
 have  a  problem  with  that  so  I'm  always 
 trying  to  evolve  in  some  way  I'm  never 
 wearing  the  same  underwear  every  day 
 always  changing  that 
 [ __ ]  never  finished  it's  out  right  now 
 ladies  and  gentlemen  I  can't  recommend 
 it  enough  it's  a  [ __ ]  fantastic  book 
 as  good  if  not  better  than  can  hurt  me 
 you're  the  man  brother  appreciate  you 
 very  much  thank  you  Joe  all  right  bye 
 everybody
