## Full Transcript

[00:02] i mean when i was competing it was
[00:04] necessary
[00:05] but it makes me remember i didn't really
[00:07] remember what uh
[00:08] what i used to be like until that it's
[00:11] like
[00:12] when i'm working out seven hours a day
[00:14] yeah and just
[00:15] so obsessed and and all i was thinking
[00:17] about was winning
[00:18] that's all i was thinking about like if
[00:20] they were if they were working out five
[00:21] hours a day i wanted
[00:22] i wanted them to know that i was gonna
[00:24] work out an extra three hours
[00:25] and i was gonna get up early and i was
[00:27] gonna text them all hey [ __ ]
[00:29] i'm up already take pictures send
[00:30] selfies you know i was like
[00:33] you're gonna die oh i kept telling them
[00:34] you're all gonna die you try to keep up
[00:36] with me you're gonna die
[00:37] you weren't fully joking no i wasn't
[00:39] joking at all
[00:40] that's what i was [ __ ] up about it was
[00:42] the scary thing when i interact with
[00:43] goggins and what i saw in you
[00:45] on during that time is like
[00:49] this guy like like this is why i've been
[00:53] avoiding david ganga's recently
[00:54] [Laughter]
[00:56] is like because he wants to meet he has
[00:58] to do like talk on this podcast but he
[01:00] also wants to run an
[01:01] ultra marathon with me and i felt like
[01:03] this is a person
[01:04] if i spend any time in this realm if i
[01:07] spend any time with the joe rogan of
[01:09] that
[01:09] sober october like i might have to die
[01:12] to get out
[01:13] like there's this kind of uh yeah
[01:15] there's a competitive aspect that's
[01:17] super unhealthy
[01:18] i mean you saw the video that we watched
[01:19] earlier today of goggins draining his
[01:21] knee
[01:22] that would stop me from running ever
[01:24] again because i would think in my head
[01:25] okay
[01:26] i'm going to ruin my cartilage i'm going
[01:27] to need a knee replacement i would start
[01:29] thinking i would
[01:30] go down that line but he is perpetually
[01:34] in this push-it mindset you know what he
[01:37] calls the dog in him you know he's got
[01:39] that dog is in him all day long and he
[01:40] feeds that dog
[01:42] you know and that's um that's who he is
[01:45] that's one of the reasons why he's so
[01:46] inspirational and he's
[01:47] fuel for millions and millions of people
[01:50] i mean he really is he motivates people
[01:52] in a way that is
[01:53] it's so powerful but it can be very
[01:56] destructive
[01:57] i just i know i know now especially
[02:01] after the sober october thing that that
[02:02] thing's still in me
[02:04] you know i didn't know so really haven't
[02:06] done anything physically competitive
[02:08] except one time i was supposed to fight
[02:09] wesley snipes it came out then too
[02:12] that came out too that got creepy too
[02:14] but luckily that never happened
[02:16] but that was many months of training
[02:19] like
[02:20] training twice a day every day
[02:22] kickboxing in the morning
[02:23] jiu-jitsu at night i was just going
[02:25] going and going and going
[02:26] and i was just thinking just all day
[02:29] long and it but
[02:30] it [ __ ] with all the other aspects of
[02:31] your life [ __ ] with your friendships
[02:33] [ __ ] with your your [ __ ] with my comedy
[02:36] [ __ ] with everything
[02:37] because that mindset is not a mindset of
[02:40] an artist
[02:41] it's a mindset of a conqueror
[03:02] you
