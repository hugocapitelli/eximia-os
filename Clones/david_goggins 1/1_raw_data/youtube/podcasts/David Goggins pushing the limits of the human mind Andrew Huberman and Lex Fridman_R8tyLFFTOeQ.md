## Transcrição

what's  interesting 
 earlier  we're  talking  about  the 
 challenge  with  david  that  you're  about 
 to  do  i  mean 
 that  is  a  psychedelic  experience  of 
 sorts  because  you're  biasing  your  mind 
 towards  a  pretty  extreme  neurochemical 
 state 
 and  you  don't  know  what  you're  going  to 
 find  there  and  that's  kind  of  the 
 excitement 
 at  least  for  me  as  an  observer  it's  like 
 i  want  to  know 
 what  what  the  experience  is  like 
 afterward  i  want  to  know  like  how  was  it 
 i  mean  i'm  sure  you're  going  to  get 
 something  like  you  said  you're  going  to 
 grow  the  question  is  how 
 and  not  resisting  i  mean  it's  the  same 
 as  with  a  psychedelic  experience  it's 
 like 
 not  like  giving  yourself  over  completely 
 to  the  experience  and 
 not  resisting  and  going  through  the 
 whole  mental  journey  of  whether  it's 
 anger  or  excitement  or  exhaustion  the 
 whole  thing 
 it's  uh  i  mean  uh 
 that's  it  the  entirety  of  the  process 
 that  david  goes  through  when  he  does  his 
 own 
 challenges  and  so  on  is  that  whole 
 journey  he  finds 
 purposely  like  missile  seeks 
 the  limits  of  the  mind  that  whatev 
 whenever 
 the  resistance  is  felt  runs  up  against 
 it  and  then  goes  to  the  full  journey  of 
 going  beyond  it  and  seeing  what's  there 
 on  the  other  side  well  stress  has  these 
 two  sides  the  limbic  friction  of  being 
 tired  and  needing  to  get  more  energized 
 that's  one  form  of  stress 
 and  then  there's  the  feeling  too  amped 
 up  and  needing  to  calm  down 
 the  the  typical  discussion  around 
 stresses  is  one  thing 
 but  it's  all  limbic  friction  it's  just 
 that  when  i  say  limbic  friction 
 that's  not  a  real  scientific  term  i  just 
 mean  the  limbic  system  wanting  to  pull 
 you  down  into  sleep  or  wanting  to  put 
 you  into  panic 
 and  you  using  top-down  processing  using 
 that 
 evolved  forebrain  to  say 
 i'm  not  going  to  go  to  sleep  and  i'm  not 
 going  to  freak  out 
 and  those  top-down  control  mechanisms 
 are  i  mean  when  those  get  honed 
 that's  beautiful  because  then  you  real 
 you're  increasing  capacity  for 
 everything 
 you
