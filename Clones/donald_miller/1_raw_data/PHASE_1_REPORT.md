### 2. Core Intellectual Framework

**The StoryBrand SB7 Framework**
Central insight: "The customer is the hero, not your brand."

Seven elements:
1. **Character** - Customer with a desire
2. **Problem** - Three levels (external, internal, philosophical)
3. **Guide** - Brand with empathy + authority
4. **Plan** - Simple 3-step process
5. **Call to Action** - Direct, clear command
6. **Failure** - Stakes if they don't act
7. **Success** - Transformation achieved

**Problem Hierarchy (Unique Insight)**
- External: Tangible, visible problem
- Internal: Emotional/psychological frustration (customers buy THIS)
- Philosophical: Why this matters to humanity

**Key Principle**: "Companies sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."
