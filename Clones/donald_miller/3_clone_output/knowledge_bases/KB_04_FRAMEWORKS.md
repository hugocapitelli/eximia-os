## Core Frameworks

### 1. StoryBrand 7-Part Framework (SB7)

**Purpose:** Clarify brand messaging so customers will listen

**The Seven Elements:**

```
1. CHARACTER (Hero)
   └─ Your customer is the hero with a desire

2. PROBLEM
   ├─ External: Surface-level, tangible problem
   ├─ Internal: How the problem makes them FEEL
   └─ Philosophical: Why this matters to humanity

3. GUIDE
   ├─ Empathy: "I understand your problem"
   └─ Authority: "I know how to solve it"

4. PLAN
   └─ Simple 3-step process to work with you

5. CALL TO ACTION
   ├─ Direct: "Buy Now" "Schedule a Call"
   └─ Transitional: "Download Guide" "Watch Demo"

6. FAILURE (Stakes)
   └─ What they'll lose if they don't act

7. SUCCESS (Transformation)
   └─ What their life looks like after
```

**Application:**
- Website copy
- Email campaigns
- Sales presentations
- Brand positioning
- Marketing materials

**Key Insight:**
"Companies tend to sell solutions to external problems, but customers buy solutions to internal problems."

### 2. Three-Level Problems Framework

**Purpose:** Understand what customers actually buy

```
EXTERNAL PROBLEM
├─ What: The surface, visible issue
├─ Example: "I need a plumber to fix my leak"
└─ Mistake: Most companies only address this

INTERNAL PROBLEM
├─ What: How the external problem makes them FEEL
├─ Example: "I feel stressed and overwhelmed by home maintenance"
└─ Truth: This is what customers actually buy

PHILOSOPHICAL PROBLEM
├─ What: Why this matters in the grand scheme
├─ Example: "Homeowners deserve peace of mind"
└─ Power: Connects to larger meaning
```

**Application Questions:**
1. What tangible problem do you solve?
2. How does having this problem make customers feel?
3. Why is it wrong for people to have this problem?

---

### 3. Guide Characteristics

**Purpose:** Position your brand correctly (as guide, not hero)

**Two Required Qualities:**

```
EMPATHY
├─ Shows you understand their problem
├─ Language: "We know how frustrating it is when..."
├─ Demonstrates: You've felt their pain
└─ Builds: Trust and connection

AUTHORITY
├─ Shows you can actually help
├─ Evidence: Testimonials, credentials, results
├─ Language: "We've helped 10,000 businesses..."
├─ Demonstrates: Competence
└─ Builds: Confidence in your ability
```

**Balance:**
- Too much empathy, not enough authority = Seems weak
- Too much authority, not enough empathy = Seems arrogant
- Both in balance = Perfect guide positioning

### 4. Hero on a Mission (Four Characters)

**Purpose:** Personal development and life meaning

**The Four Characters:**

```
VICTIM (Avoid)
├─ Mindset: Things happen TO me
├─ Behavior: Waits for rescue
├─ Story: Boring, no one roots for them
└─ Result: Stagnation

VILLAIN (Avoid)
├─ Mindset: Makes things happen to OTHERS
├─ Behavior: Manipulates, harms
├─ Story: Interesting but doomed
└─ Result: Isolation, destruction

HERO (Be This)
├─ Mindset: Takes action to transform
├─ Behavior: Engages conflict, grows
├─ Story: Compelling, we root for them
└─ Result: Transformation

GUIDE (Aspire to This)
├─ Mindset: Helps others transform
├─ Behavior: Mentors, teaches, supports
├─ Story: Has been where hero wants to go
└─ Result: Meaning through service
```

**Life Application:**
- Morning: Which character am I being today?
- Challenges: This is my hero's conflict
- Helping others: Opportunity to be guide
- Setbacks: Plot twist, not ending
