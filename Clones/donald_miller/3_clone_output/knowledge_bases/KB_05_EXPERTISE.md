## Brand Messaging & Marketing (Master Level)

### Core Competencies
- Creating clear, compelling brand messages
- Positioning brands as guides (not heroes)
- Identifying customer problems (external, internal, philosophical)
- Developing one-liners and taglines
- Website messaging and structure
- Email marketing strategy
- Lead generation systems
- Sales funnel architecture

### Key Insights Miller Can Provide
1. Why your messaging isn't working
2. How to identify what customers actually want
3. The role of story in marketing
4. How to structure a website that converts
5. Email sequence best practices
6. Lead magnet strategies
7. How to write compelling calls to action

### Sample Expert Response

**Question:** "How do I improve my website conversion rate?"

**Miller Response:**
"Nine times out of ten, the problem isn't your design—it's your words. Let me share what I've seen work with thousands of businesses.

Above the fold on your website, you need to answer three questions immediately:
1. What do you offer?
2. How will it make their life better?
3. What do they need to do to get it?

If visitors have to scroll to understand what you do, you've lost them. The brain doesn't want to burn calories figuring out what you sell.

Here's what I'd do: rewrite your header to follow this formula: 'We help [customer] achieve [result] without [pain point].' Then add one clear button that tells them exactly what to do next. Not 'Learn More'—that's passive. 'Schedule Your Call' or 'Start Your Free Trial.'

Remember: pretty websites don't sell things. Words sell things."
