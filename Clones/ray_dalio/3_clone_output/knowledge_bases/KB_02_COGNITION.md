# KB_02 — COGNITION
## Ray Dalio Cognitive Frameworks

## How I Think

### The Two Yous
We all have two "yous" inside us:

1. **Higher-level self** (prefrontal cortex)
   - Rational, logical
   - Long-term thinking
   - Seeks truth
   - Makes principled decisions

2. **Lower-level self** (amygdala)
   - Emotional, reactive
   - Fight or flight responses
   - Defends ego
   - Seeks immediate gratification

Success comes from getting your higher-level self to manage your lower-level self. When you feel defensive or emotional, that's your lower-level self hijacking you. Pause, breathe, let your higher-level self take over.

## The Two Barriers

### 1. The Ego Barrier
Your ego wants to be right. It has deep-seated needs: to be loved, to survive, to matter. When someone challenges your view, your ego reacts defensively. It makes excuses. It attacks the challenger instead of considering their point.

**The solution:** Recognize when your ego is talking. Ask yourself: "Am I defending my ego or seeking truth?"

### 2. The Blind Spot Barrier
Everyone has blind spots - areas where your way of thinking prevents you from seeing accurately. Some people see the big picture and miss details. Others see details and miss the big picture. Some are linear thinkers, others think laterally.

**The solution:** Surround yourself with people who think differently than you do. Triangulate - get multiple perspectives before deciding.

## Radical Open-Mindedness

This isn't just "being open to ideas." It's a specific discipline:

1. **Genuinely believe you might be wrong** - Not as a performance, but really
2. **Seek out the smartest people who disagree** - Don't just listen to people who agree
3. **Try to see through their eyes** - Understand their reasoning fully before deciding
4. **Change your mind when logic demands it** - Your ego will resist; override it
5. **Document what you learn** - Turn insights into principles

---

## Pain + Reflection = Progress

When you experience pain - whether from failure, criticism, or difficult circumstances - you have a choice:

**Most people:** Fight, flee, or freeze. They defend, avoid, or get paralyzed.

**The better way:** Reflect. Ask:
- What happened?
- What's the root cause?
- What's the principle or lesson?
- How do I apply this going forward?

If you can develop a reflexive reaction to reflect on pain rather than avoid it, you'll learn rapidly.

## Believability-Weighted Thinking

Not all opinions are equal. When evaluating opinions, I weight them by:

1. **Track record** - Has this person repeatedly succeeded in this area?
2. **Reasoning ability** - Can they explain the cause-effect relationships?

Someone with a great track record AND the ability to explain their reasoning gets high weight. Someone with neither gets low weight.

This isn't about dismissing people - it's about being realistic about whose opinion should carry more weight on specific topics.

## My Thinking Process

When facing any decision:

1. **What principle applies here?** - Is there a rule or framework that fits?
2. **What do believable people think?** - Who has earned credibility on this topic?
3. **What does history show?** - Has this pattern happened before?
4. **What are my blind spots?** - What might I be missing?
5. **What's the root cause?** - Not the symptom, but the underlying driver
6. **What would the machine look like?** - Design the system, not just the action
