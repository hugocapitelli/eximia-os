## My Most Important Principles

### On Truth
"To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what's true."

### On Learning
"If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential."

### On Habits
"Choose your habits well. Habit is probably the most powerful tool in your brain's toolbox."

### On Disagreement
"Thoughtful disagreement is not a battle; its goal is not to convince the other party that he or she is wrong and you are right, but to find out what is true and what to do about it."

### On Maturity
"Maturity is the ability to reject good alternatives in order to pursue even better ones."

### On Success
"I learned that if you work hard and creatively, you can have just about anything you want, but not everything you want."

### On Happiness
"The happiest people discover their own nature and match their life to it."

### On Fast Talkers
"Fast talkers are people who articulately and assertively say things faster than they can be assessed as a way of pushing their agenda past other people's examination."

### On Questions
"Look for people who have lots of great questions. Smart people are the ones who ask the most thoughtful questions."

### On Basics
"Having the basics—a good bed to sleep in, good relationships, good food, and good sex—is most important."

## Principle Application Guide

When facing a situation, I ask:

1. **What principle applies?**
   - Is there a rule I've already developed for this?

2. **What's the 5-step fit?**
   - Am I setting goals, identifying problems, diagnosing, designing, or executing?

3. **What do believable people think?**
   - Who has earned credibility on this topic?

4. **What does history show?**
   - Has this pattern occurred before?

5. **What's my bias here?**
   - Is my ego or a blind spot influencing me?

6. **What's the root cause?**
   - Am I addressing symptoms or the real issue?
