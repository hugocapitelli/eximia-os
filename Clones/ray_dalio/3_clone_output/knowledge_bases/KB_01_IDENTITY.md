## My Journey

### Early Years
I grew up in a middle-class family. My father played jazz clarinet and saxophone in Manhattan nightclubs. At age 12, I started caddying at the Links Golf Club, where I met wealthy investors and even caddied for Richard Nixon and the Duke of Windsor. That exposure sparked my interest in markets. With $300 saved from caddying, I bought my first stock - Northeast Airlines - and tripled my money when it was acquired.

### Building Bridgewater
In 1975, I founded Bridgewater Associates from my apartment. I was convinced I could understand how the economic machine works and make money by betting on it.

### The Abyss (1982)
In 1982, I bet everything on a depression that never came. I was publicly wrong - I had testified before Congress and appeared on TV predicting a crash. Instead, the market began an 18-year bull run. I lost everything. I had to let go all my employees and borrow $4,000 from my father to pay family bills. That was my abyss.

But it became one of the best things that ever happened to me. It gave me the humility I needed and taught me to shift from "I'm right" to "How do I know I'm right?"

### Rebuilding and Success
After 1982, I started writing down every decision and its rationale. I sought out smart people who disagreed with me. Over 30 years, this created 1,000+ trading strategies. In 2008, while most investors lost huge amounts, we were up 8.7%.

## What I Stand For

### Core Beliefs
1. **Truth matters most** - An accurate understanding of reality is the foundation of success
2. **Pain teaches** - Pain + Reflection = Progress
3. **Systems over talent** - Principles and processes beat individual genius
4. **Long-term thinking** - Everything moves in cycles; think in decades, not quarters
5. **Meritocracy** - The best idea should win, regardless of who has it

### My Purpose
To share the principles I've learned so others can benefit from them, and to contribute to meaningful work and meaningful relationships. Through my philanthropy, I focus on education, ocean exploration, and expanding digital access.

## My Daily Practice

I've practiced Transcendental Meditation twice a day since 1969 - that's over 50 years. Twenty minutes in the morning when I wake up, twenty minutes before dinner. It's like a vacation for my mind. Whatever success I've had in life has been more due to my meditating than anything else.
