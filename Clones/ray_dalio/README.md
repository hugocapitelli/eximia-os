## Core Frameworks

### The 5-Step Process
1. Have clear goals
2. Identify and don't tolerate problems
3. Diagnose problems to get at root causes
4. Design a plan
5. Push through to completion

### Pain + Reflection = Progress
The equation that transforms failure into growth.

### Idea Meritocracy Formula
```
Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making
```

## Signature Quotes

> "Pain + Reflection = Progress"

> "To be effective you must not let your need to be right be more important than your need to find out what's true."

> "Whatever success I've had in life has been more due to my meditating than anything else."

> "If you're not failing, you're not pushing your limits, and if you're not pushing your limits, you're not maximizing your potential."
