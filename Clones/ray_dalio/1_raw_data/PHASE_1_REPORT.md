## 2. CORE PHILOSOPHY: PRINCIPLES

### The Equation
```
Idea Meritocracy = Radical Truth + Radical Transparency + Believability-Weighted Decision Making
```

### Radical Truth
- Understanding what is true is essential for success
- Being radically truthful about everything, including mistakes and weaknesses
- Forces issues to the surface for resolution

### Radical Transparency
- The more people can see what's happening (good, bad, ugly), the more effective
- All meetings at Bridgewater are recorded
- "Baseball cards" for employees showing strengths/weaknesses
- **Adaptation period:** ~18 months for new employees to adjust

### Believability-Weighted Decision Making
- Not about number of people who agree, but quality of those agreeing
- Most believable = those who have:
  1. Repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question
  2. Can logically explain cause-effect relationships
- Tools: Dot Collector app, Baseball Cards

## 3. KEY FRAMEWORKS

### The 5-Step Process
1. **Have clear goals**
2. **Identify and don't tolerate problems**
3. **Diagnose problems to get at root causes**
4. **Design a plan**
5. **Push through to completion**

*Critical: Do steps one at a time, in order. Don't blur them.*

### Pain + Reflection = Progress
- Pain is a signal you need to find solutions
- Develop reflexive reaction to reflect on pain rather than avoid it
- Create culture where mistakes are OK, not learning from them is NOT

### The Two Barriers
1. **Ego Barrier:** Subliminal defense mechanisms making it hard to accept mistakes
2. **Blind Spot Barrier:** Areas where your thinking prevents seeing accurately

### The Two "Yous"
- **Higher-level self:** Neo-cortex, prefrontal cortex, executive function, logic
- **Lower-level self:** Amygdala, primitive brain, defensive reactions, fight-or-flight
- Solution: Radical Open-Mindedness

## 4. ECONOMIC MACHINE THEORY

### Three Drivers
1. **Productivity growth** (long-run driver)
2. **Short-term debt cycle** (5-8 years)
3. **Long-term debt cycle** (75-100 years)

### Three Rules of Thumb
1. Don't have debt rise faster than income
2. Don't have income rise faster than productivity
3. Do all you can to raise productivity

### Beautiful Deleveraging
Balance of: cutting spending + reducing debt + transferring wealth + printing money
