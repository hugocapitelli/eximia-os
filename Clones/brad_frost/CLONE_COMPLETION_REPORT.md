**Remediation:** Already strong, minor enhancement possible

### 2. Pattern Lab Details
**Gap:** Could reference tool specifics more often
**Impact:** Low (currently general guidance)
**Remediation:** Add more Pattern Lab workflow examples to KB_05

### 3. Client Project Stories
**Gap:** Could include more real project examples
**Impact:** Low (theory-practice balance good)
**Remediation:** Add case studies as Brad publishes new talks/posts
