## PART 2: Signature Quotes & Principles

### Key Quotes:
1. "A design system is the official story of how an organization designs and builds user interfaces."
2. "Build systems, not pages." (Core directive)
3. "A design system is a library of solved problems."
4. "Good performance is good design."
5. "Performance as Design" - treat speed as design feature
6. "Creativity and collaboration should not be sacrificed on the altar of automation."
7. Design tokens analogy: "That door needs to do certain things. It needs to open and close. How that door is painted does not impact its ability to function."
8. On collaboration: "It's the human relationships part... Y'all aren't talking to each other at all. That's your actual problem."
9. "Anybody can make a button. That's not the hard part" - the challenge is people/process/culture
10. Creating UI components "without philosophy, principles, guidelines, processes, and documentation is like dumping IKEA components and saying 'Build a dresser!'"

### Core Principles:
- **Systems over pages** - Holistic thinking
- **Modularity & reusability** - DRY principles for design
- **Human-centered collaboration** - Breaking designer/developer silos
- **Pragmatic & actionable** - Real-world applicability
- **Performance matters** - Speed as design feature
- **Documentation essential** - Guideposts for teams
- **Design tokens** - Separation of structure/aesthetics

## PART 3: Atomic Design (Complete Methodology)

### 5 Levels:
1. **Atoms** - HTML elements, colors, fonts, spacing (fundamental blocks)
2. **Molecules** - Simple component groups (search form = label + input + button)
3. **Organisms** - Complex sections (header = logo + nav + search)
4. **Templates** - Page layouts with content structure
5. **Pages** - Real content instances

### Philosophy:
- Not linear, mental model for concurrent development
- Parts influence whole, whole influences parts
- Ensures consistency, scalability, efficiency
- Common language for designers + developers

---

## PART 4: Pattern Lab Tool

**What:** Open-source frontend workshop environment / static site generator

**Purpose:** Build, view, test, showcase design system UI components

**Features:**
- Nested patterns support
- Dynamic data design
- Multiple templating engines
- Living style guide generation
- Collaboration hub for design + dev teams

**Integration:** Implements Atomic Design principles directly

---

## PART 5: Design Systems Philosophy

### Core Beliefs:
- **Modularity:** Reusable components across contexts
- **Scalability:** System grows without becoming unwieldy
- **Consistency:** Unified visual language
- **Collaboration:** Cross-disciplinary workflows essential
- **Shared vocabulary:** Common language removes friction
- **Documentation:** Philosophy + principles + guidelines > just components

### Benefits:
1. Consistency across products
2. Faster development (reuse > rebuild)
3. Easier maintenance (update once = everywhere)
4. Better testing (isolated components)
5. Natural organization for documentation
6. Flexibility for multi-brand systems

---

## PART 6: Responsive/Mobile-First

### Mobile-First Philosophy (Luke Wroblewski)

**Why Mobile-First:**
- Wider reach (global mobile penetration)
- Forces focus on core content
- Encourages innovation (geolocation, touch)
- Progressive enhancement foundation
- Addresses constraints first (small screen, low bandwidth)

**Responsive Design:**
- Fluid grids
- Flexible images/media
- Media queries
- Content determines breakpoints (device-agnostic)

**Principles of Adaptive Design:**
- Ubiquity, Flexibility, Performance, Enhancement, Future-Friendly

---

## PART 7: Design Tokens ("Subatomic Particles")

**Definition:** Abstract design decisions (colors, spacing, typography) into central variables

**Purpose:**
- Maintain consistency
- Enable synchronization (Figma ↔ code)
- Separate structure from aesthetics
- Multi-brand/multi-product systems

**Course:** "Subatomic: The Complete Guide To Design Tokens" (with comprehensive architecture/naming/governance)

---

## PART 8: Style Guides & Documentation

### Style Guide Best Practices:
- **Cross-disciplinary:** Useful for all stakeholders
- **Approachable:** Clear purpose and importance
- **Agnostic:** Broad, reusable naming (not context-specific)
- **Living:** Documentation alongside code for easy updates
- **Educational:** Marketing tool for design system adoption

### Documentation Philosophy:
- Tailor detail to audience needs
- Style guide as "storefront" for components
- Encourage contributions from all disciplines

---

## PART 9: Talks & Presentations

### Regular Venues:
- **SmashingConf** (frequent speaker, workshops)
- **Deep Dive podcast**
- **Syntax podcast**
- **The State of the Web** (YouTube)
- **FRONT ZURICH**
- **Hatch Conference**

### Common Topics:
- Design systems benefits
- Atomic Design methodology

## PART 10: Writing Style

**Characteristics:**
- Direct & conversational ("Words that would otherwise be coming out of my mouth")
- Accessible - complex ideas made digestible
- Practical & actionable
- Educational tone
- Emphasizes human/collaborative aspects alongside technical

**Blog Topics:**
- Design systems evolution
- Atomic Design refinements
- Performance optimization
- Collaboration workflows
- Industry trends & observations

---

## PART 11: Collaboration & Workshops

### Key Philosophy:
- Design/dev collaboration is human problem, not just technical
- Shared vocabulary essential
- Early prototype in browser (HTML/CSS/JS)
- Pattern-driven workflows
- Cross-disciplinary from start

### Collaboration Strategies:
- Get designs into real medium early
- User testing with actual browsers/devices
- Designers understand constraints
- Developers involved in design process
- Tools shouldn't create silos

**Notable Collaborator:** Dan Mall (designer-developer workflow demonstrations)

---

## PART 12: Performance Optimization

### "Performance as Design" Philosophy:

**Core Beliefs:**
- "Good performance is good design"
- Fast websites = respect for users' time
- 5+ second load = user abandonment
- Performance is shared responsibility

**Best Practices:**
1. State performance goals in project docs (SoW, design briefs)
2. Educate stakeholders on performance implications
3. Test on real devices frequently (not just emulators)
4. Avoid bloat - prioritize content
5. Mobile-first promotes leaner experiences
6. Modular components (Atomic Design) = efficient codebases
