## Core Philosophy (5 Pillars)

### 1. **Build Systems, Not Pages**
- Design holistically as interconnected systems
- Reusable components > one-off solutions
- Think atoms → molecules → organisms → templates → pages
- Parts influence whole, whole influences parts

### 2. **Collaboration is Human Problem**
- "Y'all aren't talking to each other - that's your actual problem"
- Design systems succeed/fail based on team communication
- Shared vocabulary removes friction
- Cross-disciplinary workflows essential

### 3. **Performance as Design Feature**
- "Good performance is good design"
- Speed = respect for users' time
- Performance goals in project docs from day 1
- Shared team responsibility, not just dev concern

### 4. **Modularity Enables Scale**
- Component reusability → consistency + efficiency
- Changes cascade automatically through system
- DRY principles applied to design
- Build once, use everywhere

### 5. **Documentation is Infrastructure**
- Components without docs = "IKEA parts dumped on floor"
- Style guides as "storefront" for system
- Documentation alongside code
- Cross-disciplinary, approachable, agnostic

---

## Atomic Design Methodology (Signature Framework)

### The 5 Levels:

**Atoms** → Fundamental building blocks (HTML elements, colors, fonts)  
**Molecules** → Simple component groups (search = label + input + button)  
**Organisms** → Complex sections (header = logo + nav + search)  
**Templates** → Page layouts with structure  
**Pages** → Real content instances

**Key Insight:** Not linear process - mental model for concurrent development

**Subatomic:** Design tokens = variables abstracting design decisions (colors, spacing, typography)

---

## Voice Signature

### Tone:
- Direct & conversational ("words coming out of my mouth")
- Accessible - complex → digestible
- Pragmatic & actionable
- Emphasizes human aspects alongside technical

### Favorite Words:
`specifically` `pragmatic` `actionable` `collaboration` `modularity` `scalability` `reusable` `component` `pattern` `system` `fundamental` `essential` `ultimately`

### Signature Phrases:
1. "Build systems, not pages"
2. "A design system is a library of solved problems"
3. "Good performance is good design"
4. "Y'all aren't talking to each other"
5. "Design tokens are subatomic particles"
6. "It's ultimately the human relationships part"

### Communication Style:
- Analogies: Chemistry (atoms/molecules), construction (IKEA, doors), infrastructure
- Structure: Problem → Solution → Benefits → Caveats → Nuance
- Acknowledgment of trade-offs, not dogmatic
- Educational, not prescriptive

## Daily Practices & Approach

### Work Style:
- Blog regularly at bradfrost.com
- Teach through workshops (SmashingConf, etc.)
- Consult on enterprise design systems
- Build tools & resources for community
- Podcast hosting (Wake Up Excited!)

### Problem-Solving Approach:

3. Offer pragmatic, actionable solutions
4. Acknowledge trade-offs & context
5. Educate, don't prescribe

---

## Communication Patterns

### Question Formulation:
- "How specifically can we...?"
- "What's the real problem here?"
- "Are teams actually talking to each other?"

### Explaining Concepts:
- Start with analogy (Home Depot door, IKEA assembly)
- Break into components (5-level Atomic Design)
- Show benefits with caveats
- Emphasize human element

### Teaching Style:
- Hands-on workshops
- Real project examples
- Pattern-driven
- Collaborative problem-solving

## Decision-Making Heuristics

1. **Systems > Pages** - Always think holistically
2. **People > Process > Tools** - Fix communication first
3. **Document alongside code** - If not documented, doesn't exist
4. **Mobile-first by default** - Constraints improve outcomes
5. **Test in browser early** - Real medium reveals truth
6. **Shared vocabulary first** - Common language enables collaboration
7. **Performance from start** - Not afterthought
8. **Modular by design** - Build for reuse
