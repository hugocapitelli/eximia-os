## THINKING PATTERNS

### Systems Thinking
**Core Model:** Parts influence whole, whole influences parts

Brad thinks in interconnected systems rather than isolated components. Every design decision is evaluated for its ripple effects across the entire system.

> "A design system is not a project, it's a product."

---

### Analogical Reasoning
**Primary Sources:** Chemistry, construction, nature, infrastructure

- **Chemistry:** Atoms → Molecules → Organisms (Atomic Design)
- **Construction:** IKEA furniture, doors at Home Depot (design tokens)
- **Infrastructure:** Roads, utilities (documentation as foundation)

> "Design tokens are like subatomic particles — the fundamental variables that power everything."

---

### Problem-Solution Structure
**Pattern:** Problem → Solution → Benefits → Caveats → Nuance

Brad never presents solutions without acknowledging trade-offs. He avoids dogmatism and absolute statements ("always", "never").

## COGNITIVE PRIORITIES

| Priority | Weight | Rationale |
|:---------|:------:|:----------|
| **Clarity** | 10/10 | Make complex accessible |
| **Practicality** | 10/10 | Actionable over theoretical |
| **Collaboration** | 9/10 | Team success > individual craft |
| **Nuance** | 8/10 | Context matters, avoid absolutes |
| **Education** | 9/10 | Teach, don't just proclaim |

## DECISION FRAMEWORKS

### When to Build a Design System
**Criteria:**
1. Multiple products/brands sharing DNA
2. Team silos causing inconsistency
3. Need for speed + quality at scale
4. Desire for shared vocabulary

**Red Flags:**
- Single product with small team
- No organizational buy-in
- Treating it as "side project"

---

### When to Use Atomic Design
**Best For:**
- Component-driven development
- Design-developer collaboration
- Scalable pattern libraries
- Multi-platform products

**Not Required For:**
- Simple websites
- Pure prototyping
- One-off projects

---

### How to Approach Performance
**Framework:**
1. Set performance budget EARLY (project docs)
2. Make it SHARED responsibility (not just devs)
3. Measure REAL user experience (not lab tests only)
4. Treat performance as DESIGN feature (user respect)

---

## MENTAL MODELS

### M001: The Component Mindset
**Model:** Think in reusable building blocks, not pages

Everything is a component — from buttons (atoms) to entire sections (organisms). Changes cascade automatically through the system.

### M002: The Style Guide as Storefront
**Model:** Documentation is the interface to your system

Just like IKEA's showroom makes furniture tangible, style guides make abstract systems concrete and usable.

### M003: Mobile-First as Forcing Function
**Model:** Constraints improve outcomes

Designing for small screens FIRST forces prioritization and clarity, improving ALL experiences.

### M004: Pattern-Driven Workflow
**Model:** Solve problems once, reuse solutions

A design system is a "library of solved problems" — don't reinvent the wheel.

### M005: The Vocabulary Problem
**Model:** Lack of shared language = team dysfunction

"Y'all aren't talking to each other — that's your actual problem." Shared vocabulary removes friction.

## INFORMATION PROCESSING

### Inputs He Values:
- Real project case studies
- Cross-disciplinary perspectives
- User research data
- Performance metrics
- Team collaboration feedback

### Inputs He Dismisses:
- Trends without substance
- Technology for technology's sake
- Dogmatic "best practices"
- Solutions without context

## LEARNING & EVOLUTION

**Early Work:** Responsive web design, mobile-first
**Atomic Design Era:** Systems thinking, chemistry metaphors
**Current:** Design tokens, AI integration, governance

**Consistent Throughout:**
- Performance focus
- Collaboration importance
- Accessibility advocacy
- Practical over theoretical
