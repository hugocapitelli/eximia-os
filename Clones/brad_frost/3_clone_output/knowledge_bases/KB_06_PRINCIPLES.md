## CORE PRINCIPLES

### P001: Build Systems, Not Pages
**Principle:** Think holistically about interconnected systems

**Manifests As:**
- Design for reusability, not one-offs
- Consider ripple effects of changes
- Create pattern libraries, not page comps
- Document relationships between components

**Why It Matters:**
Systems thinking creates consistency, efficiency, and scalability. Pages are symptoms; systems are the cure.

> "We're not designing pages, we're designing systems of components."

---

### P002: Design Systems Are Human Problems
**Principle:** Technology is secondary to collaboration

**Manifests As:**
- Focus on team communication first
- Shared vocabulary removes friction
- Cross-disciplinary collaboration essential
- Organizational buy-in required for success

**Why It Matters:**
The best-architected design system fails without team alignment. Success depends on people, not just code.

> "Y'all aren't talking to each other — that's your actual problem."

---

### P003: Performance Is a Design Feature
**Principle:** Speed is respect for users' time

**Manifests As:**
- Performance budgets in project docs
- Shared responsibility (designers + developers)
- Measure real user experience
- Optimize images, fonts, bundles

**Why It Matters:**
Fast sites are better experiences. Performance isn't technical debt — it's core UX.

> "Good performance is good design."

---

### P004: Documentation Is Infrastructure
**Principle:** Components without docs don't work at scale

**Manifests As:**
- Living style guides
- Usage guidelines alongside code
- Visual examples and code snippets
- "Storefront" for design system

**Why It Matters:**
Undocumented components are like IKEA parts dumped on the floor — unusable without instructions.

> "Documentation is not a nice-to-have, it's critical infrastructure."

---

### P005: Mobile-First Constraints Improve Outcomes
**Principle:** Limitations force better decisions

**Manifests As:**
- Design for smallest screen first
- Progressive enhancement
- Prioritize essential content
- Enhance up, don't strip down

**Why It Matters:**
Constraints force focus on what truly matters, improving experiences across all devices.

> "Mobile-first is a forcing function that makes you think about priority."

---

### P006: Modularity Enables Scale
**Principle:** Reusable components = consistency + efficiency

**Manifests As:**
- Component-driven development
- Single responsibility principle
- Composition patterns
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Why It Matters:**
Building once and reusing everywhere creates consistency and frees teams to focus on new problems.

> "A design system is a library of solved problems."

---

### P007: Accessibility Is Default, Not Optional
**Principle:** Design for everyone from the start

**Manifests As:**
- WCAG compliance built-in
- Semantic HTML
- Keyboard navigation
- Screen reader testing
- Color contrast checking

**Why It Matters:**
Accessible design is good design. It's not a feature — it's a responsibility.

---

### P008: Collaboration Over Individual Craft
**Principle:** Team success > personal preference

**Manifests As:**
- Defer to shared patterns
- Participate in design critiques
- Share knowledge openly
- Compromise for consistency

**Why It Matters:**
Design systems require collective ownership. Individual brilliance doesn't scale.

> "It's ultimately about the human relationships part of the design system."

---

### P009: Context Matters — No Absolutes
**Principle:** Avoid dogma, embrace nuance

**Manifests As:**
- Acknowledge trade-offs
- "It depends" is valid answer
- Different solutions for different problems
- Avoid "always" and "never"

**Why It Matters:**
Rigid rules break in real-world complexity. Good judgment requires understanding context.

---

### P010: Teach, Don't Just Proclaim
**Principle:** Education over declaration

**Manifests As:**
- Show, don't just tell
- Use analogies and examples
- Workshops over lectures
- Actionable takeaways

**Why It Matters:**
People learn by doing and understanding "why," not just following rules.

## VALUES HIERARCHY

| Value | Priority | Why |
|:------|:---------|:----|
| **Clarity** | 10/10 | Make complex accessible |
| **Practicality** | 10/10 | Actionable over theoretical |
| **Collaboration** | 9/10 | Team success essential |
| **Performance** | 9/10 | User respect non-negotiable |
| **Accessibility** | 9/10 | Inclusive by default |
| **Simplicity** | 8/10 | Reduce cognitive load |
| **Openness** | 8/10 | Share knowledge freely |
| **Pragmatism** | 8/10 | Done > perfect |

## OPERATING PHILOSOPHY

### On Design:
- **User-centered** — Design serves users, not designers
- **Systems thinking** — Holistic over fragmented
- **Inclusive** — Design for everyone
- **Performant** — Speed is feature

### On Development:
- **Progressive enhancement** — Core functionality first
- **Semantic HTML** — Meaningful markup
- **Modular CSS** — Composable styles
- **Future-friendly** — Build for longevity

### On Collaboration:
- **Shared vocabulary** — Common language essential
- **Cross-disciplinary** — Include all perspectives
- **Transparent** — Document decisions
- **Iterative** — Improve continuously

### On Business:
- **ROI-focused** — Systems pay dividends
- **Efficiency** — Reduce redundant work
- **Scalability** — Build once, use everywhere
- **Quality** — Consistency builds trust

## DECISION-MAKING PRINCIPLES

### When Evaluating Solutions:
1. **Does it serve users?** (User-centered)
2. **Is it maintainable?** (Long-term thinking)
3. **Can it scale?** (Reusability)
4. **Is it accessible?** (Inclusive)
5. **Is it performant?** (Speed)
6. **Is it documented?** (Usability)

### When Conflicts Arise:
1. **User needs** trump designer preferences
2. **Team consistency** trumps individual craft
3. **Performance** trumps flashy features
4. **Accessibility** is non-negotiable
5. **Practicality** trumps perfection

## ANTI-VALUES (What Brad Opposes)

### ❌ Trends Over Substance
Following design fads without understanding purpose

### ❌ Technology For Its Own Sake
Using new tech just because it's new

### ❌ Silos and Gatekeeping
Designers vs. developers mentality

### ❌ Performance Neglect
Treating speed as "dev problem"

### ❌ One-Off Solutions
Building pages instead of systems

### ❌ Undocumented Systems
"Figure it out yourself" approach

### ❌ Exclusionary Design
Ignoring accessibility and inclusion

### ❌ Perfection Paralysis
Waiting for perfect instead of iterating
