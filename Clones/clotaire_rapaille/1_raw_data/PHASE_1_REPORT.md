## Key Discoveries

### 1. Core Methodology: The Culture Code

Rapaille's primary framework consists of:

**Three-Brain Model (Triune Brain):**
1. **Cortex** - Logic, reasoning, rationalization
2. **Limbic** - Emotions, feelings
3. **Reptilian** - Primal instincts, survival (THE KEY)

**Core Insight:** "The reptilian always wins. I don't care what you're going to tell me intellectually. Give me the reptilian."

### 2. The Three-Hour Discovery Session

Rapaille's proprietary research methodology:

| Hour | Brain Level | Activity |
|------|-------------|----------|
| 1st | Cortex | Seated discussion, collect clichés |
| 2nd | Limbic | Collages, disconnect cortex |
| 3rd | Reptilian | Lie on floor, dim lights, regression to childhood memories |

### 3. Imprint Theory

Developed from work with autistic children:
- First emotional experience with a word creates permanent neural pathway
- "Without emotion, there is no production of neurotransmitters"
- Cultural imprints differ by nationality
- First 15 years determine cultural code absorption

### 4. Cultural Codes (Examples)

| Concept | American | French | German |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| Cheese | DEAD | ALIVE | - |
| Jeep | HORSE | LIBERATOR | LIBERATOR |
| Money | PROOF | - | - |
| Work | WHO YOU ARE | - | - |
| America | DREAM | SPACE TRAVELER | JOHN WAYNE |

### 5. America as Adolescent Culture

Framework positioning cultures by developmental stage:
- America = Adolescent (now-focused, dramatic, exploratory)
- Europe = "More mature" (implicit: senile by comparison)
- Quote: "I choose to be American because I'd rather be part of an adolescent culture than a senile culture."

## Major Case Studies

### 1. PT Cruiser (Chrysler) - Flagship Success
- First vehicle designed using archetype research
- Discovered: Americans want cars that say "Don't mess with me"
- Result: "Hottest selling car on the market" (2000)

### 2. Folgers Coffee (P&G)
- Discovery: Coffee imprint = morning scent (not taste)
- "Fragrance of waking up to it brewing as a child"
- People cried during testing - "This is just coffee, but people were crying"

### 3. Jeep Wrangler
- American Code: HORSE (freedom, rugged individualism)
- European Code: LIBERATOR
- Design implications: Round headlights (like horse's eyes), removable doors

### 4. SUVs and Hummer
- Code: DOMINATION
- "It says if you want to fight, I can fight. But you will die."

## Controversies & Criticisms

### Scientific Criticism
- Triune brain theory "heavily contradicted by scientific evidence"
- MacLean's model considered outdated in modern neuroscience
- Regression techniques called "primitive"

### Professional Criticism
- "Both irrational and behind the times" (academic critics)
- "Simplistic and a shameless self-promoter" (rival researchers)
- Chrysler disputed his exclusive credit for PT Cruiser

### Ethical Concerns
- Methods described as manipulative
- One critic: "This guy has sold his soul to the devil"
