# KB_02: Frameworks & Methodologies - Tim Ferriss

**Knowledge Base:** Frameworks & Methodologies  
  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Systematic approaches and repeatable processes for achieving specific outcomes

---

## Master Frameworks

### 1. DEAL Framework (4-Hour Workweek - Lifestyle Design)

**Purpose:** Escape 9-5, design ideal lifestyle, join the New Rich

**Components:**

**D - Definition**
- Redefine success (relative income > absolute income)
- Mini-retirements vs. deferred-life plan
- Identify fear vs. goal imbalance
- What does your ideal day look like?

**E - Elimination**
- 80/20 everything (vital few > trivial many)
- Low-information diet (selective ignorance)
- Learn to say no / be difficult when counts
- Batch tasks and interruptions
- Parkinson's Law: Work expands to fill time

**A - Automation**
- Outsource everything possible (virtual assistants)
- Set up muse (automated income source)
- Build systems, not dependencies
- Test products via Google AdWords before building

**L - Liberation**
- Negotiate remote work arrangement
- Geoarbitrage (earn USD, spend in low-cost countries)
- Location independence
- Travel while working (or mini-retire)

**Outcomes:** 4h/week management of BrainQUICKEN, $40-70K/month, freedom to travel/learn

**Usage:** Apply to any business/career seeking time freedom and location independence

---

### 2. DiSSS Method (Meta-Learning - Skill Acquisition)

**Purpose:** Learn any skill in record time by deconstructing it systematically

**Components:**

**D - Deconstruction**
- Break skill into smallest learnable units
- What are the minimal components?
- Interview top performers - what do they all do?
- Find "Lego blocks" of the skill

**S - Selection (80/20)**
- Which 20% of blocks produce 80% of results?
- What's the minimum effective dose (MED)?
- Focus on highest-frequency/highest-value sub-skills first
- Ignore the trivial many

**S - Sequencing**
- What's the optimal order to learn selected blocks?
- Dependencies: What must come before what?
- Fastest path to competence, not mastery
- Example: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu - defense before offense

**S - Stakes**
- Create consequences for non-compliance
- Public commitment, financial stakes, accountability
- Make failure more painful than effort
- Bet money, announce publicly, find accountability partner

**Outcomes:** Learned conversational Japanese in 3 months, tango in 3 months, became national kick-boxing champion

**Usage:** Apply when learning language, sport, creative skill, business domain

### 3. Fear-Setting (Decision-Making Tool)

**Purpose:** Make better decisions by defining and planning for worst-case scenarios (Stoic premeditatio malorum)

**Components (3-Page Exercise):**

**Page 1: Define**
- Column 1: What bad things could happen if I do this?
  - Be SPECIFIC (not "failure" but "I lose $X," "need to move home for Y months")
  - 10-20 worst-case scenarios
- Column 2: How can I PREVENT each scenario?
  - Concrete actions to reduce probability
- Column 3: If it happens anyway, how can I REPAIR?
  - Recovery steps, who could help, timeline

**Page 2: Benefits**
- What are the benefits of an attempt or partial success?
- What skills would I build?
- How-does this affect my confidence?
- Capture upside, not just downside

**Page  **3: Cost of Inaction**
- If I avoid this decision, what does my life look like in:
  - 6 months?
  - 1 year?
  - 3 years?
- What is the emotional/financial/physical cost of inaction?
- Often inaction is the greatest risk

**Outcomes:** Decided to travel despite corporate job fears, quit unfulfilling work, start BrainQUICKEN

**Usage:** Major life decisions (career change, relocation, relationship, business launch)

---

### 4. Minimum Effective Dose (MED)

**Purpose:** Achieve desired outcome with smallest intervention (efficiency principle)

**Concept:**
- Boiling water: 212°F required, 213°F is wasted energy
- Tanning: 15min sun = tan, 4 hours = burn (more ≠ better)
- Exercise: 20min intense > 2h moderate for fat loss
- Learning: Master 100 high-frequency words before grammar rules

**Application Process:**
1. Define desired outcome precisely
2. Identify smallest dose that produces outcome
3. Test incrementally (don't skip to excess)
4. Track results, iterate
5. Stop at MED (more = diminishing or negative returns)

**Examples:**
- **Sleep:** 5.5-6.5h (for Tim) vs. conventional 8h
- **Workweek:** 4h management vs. 80h hustle
- **Workout:** Occam's Protocol (30min 2x/week)
- **Book promotion:** 2 week media blitz vs. year-long campaign

**Outcomes:** Maximum results with minimum time/energy investment

**Usage:** Apply to health, learning, business, relationships when seek efficiency

### 5. Dreamlining (Goal-Setting)

**Purpose:** Replace 5-year goals with 3-6 month "dreamlines" that create Exciting action now

**Process:**

**Step 1: Define Dreamlines**
- Timeline: 3 months and 6 months (NOT 5 years)
- Categories: Being, Having, Doing
- 5 items per category per timeline
- Make them exciting (not "should"), specific, measurable

**Being:** What do you want to be? (Identity)
- Learn Spanish, be fluent enough for business meetings
- Be someone who meditates daily
- Be a black belt in BJJ

**Having:** What do you want to have? (Possessions)
- Specific car, house, wardrobe
- Financial: $X/month passive income
- Relationships: Close friendship with Y people

**Doing:** What do you want to do? (Experiences)
- Travel to specific countries
- Learn specific skills
- Complete specific projects

**Step 2: Calculate Monthly Cost**
- How much does each dreamline cost per month?
- Often shockingly low (~$1000-3000/month for "dream" lifestyle)
- Converts abstract goals to concrete Target Monthly Income (TMI)

**Step 3: Design Steps**
- What 2-3 actions would move me toward each dreamline this week?
- Make them small, specific, time-bound
- Often just requires asking/testing, not massive prep

**Outcomes:** Realized "dream lifestyle" cost $3K/month, achievable with BrainQUICKEN automation

**Usage:** When feeling stuck, need motivation, or defaulting to "someday" thinking

### 6. The 80/20 Analysis (Pareto Applied)

**Purpose:** Identify vital few activities/clients/products that create most results

**Process:**

**Step 1: Collect Data**
- List all: clients, products, tasks, relationships, commitments
- Quantify contribution (revenue, happiness, growth, etc.)
- Be comprehensive (need full picture to see pattern)

**Step 2: Rank by Impact**
- Which 20% produce 80% of positive outcomes?
- Which 20% produce 80% of problems/stress?
- Often overlapping (difficult client may be high revenue)

**Step 3: Decide & Act**
- **Eliminate/Fire:** Bottom 20% of clients (if cause 80% headaches)
- **Automate:** Middle tasks that don't need you
- **Focus:** Top 20% - do more of what works

**Step 4: Iterate**
- Reanalyze quarterly
- 80/20 is fractal (can apply 80/20 to the top 20%)

**Examples:**
- **BrainQUICKEN:** Fired customers with high maintenance/low profit
- **Podcast:** Episodes with highest downloads inform future guest selection
- **Life:** Which 20% of activities give 80% of happiness?

**Outcomes:** BrainQUICKEN went from 80h/week to 4h/week by ruthless 80/20 application

**Usage:** Business optimization, time management, relationship evaluation, content strategy

## Supporting Frameworks

### 7. Low-Information Diet

**Purpose:** Protect attention and reduce noise for better decision-making

**Rules:**
- No news (99% irrelevant to your goals, depressing, out of your control)
- Batch email checking (2x/day max)
- Remove social media apps from phone
- Just-in-time learning (Google when needed, not "just in case")
- Ask others to filter: "Tell me only if X impacts my business"

**Outcomes:** More focus, less anxiety, better decisions, time for deep work

---

### 8. Selective Ignorance

**Purpose:** Strategically choose what NOT to know

**Principle:** Information is time-consuming. Assume information is irrelevant unless proves otherwise.

**Applications:**
- Don't track every metric, only vital few
- Don't read books, articles, newsletters "just to know" - only when solving specific problem
- Don't debate politics, celebrity news, sports (unless genuine passion)

**Test:** "Will this change my behavior?" If no, ignore.

---

### 9. Batch Processing

**Purpose:** Reduce context switching, increase efficiency

**Examples:**
- **Email:** 2x/day (11am, 4pm) for 30min each, not constant checking
- **Meetings:** One day per week, all stacked
- **Content creation:** Record 4 podcast episodes in 2 days vs. 1/week
- **Admin:** Monthly batch (bills, planning, reviews)

**Benefits:** Flow state, reduced cognitive load, faster completion

---

### 10. Muse Income (Automated Cashflow)

**Purpose:** Create low-maintenance income source funding lifestyle

**Characteristics:**
- Automated or semi-automated
- Scalable without linear time increase
- 4h/week management or less
- $3-10K/month (funds "dream lifestyle")

**Examples:**
- Informational products (ebooks, courses)
- Dropshipping / ecommerce
- Software/apps
- BrainQUICKEN (supplement sales)

**Process:**
1. Identify niche (expertise + demand)
2. Test via Google AdWords (don't build first)
3. Automate fulfillment (outsource, drop-ship)
4. Set up virtual assistants for customer service
5. Monitor, optimize, extract self from process
