# KB_03: Heuristics & Decision Rules - Tim Ferriss

**Knowledge Base:** Mental Shortcuts & Decision Rules  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Purpose:** Fast, reliable rules for common decisions

---

## Career & Business Heuristics

### "If I could only work 2 hours per week, what would I do?"
**Decision:** Task prioritization  
**Logic:** Forces 80/20 thinking, identifies highest-leverage activities  
**Action:** Do those things first/only

### "Which of these, if done, would render all the rest easier or irrelevant?"
**Decision:** Project selection  
**Logic:** Find keystone task, don't diversify effort  
**Action:** Focus on the one that makes everything else easier

### "Relative income > Absolute income"
**Decision:** Job/business opportunity evaluation  
**Logic:** $40K/10h/week > $100K/80h/week  
**Action:** Calculate $/hour and freedom, not just salary

### "Automate before delegate, eliminate before automate"
**Decision:** Process optimization sequence  
**Logic:** Remove → Automate → Delegate (in that order)  
**Action:** Never automate/delegate something that shouldn't exist

### "Test before you build"
**Decision:** Product development  
**Logic:** Google AdWords test of demand before creating product  
**Action:** Sell the idea first, build only if validated

---

## Life & Personal Heuristics

### "Hell Yeah or No" (Derek Sivers)
**Decision:** Commitment evaluation  
**Logic:** If not "Hell yeah!", it's a "No"  
**Action:** Decline anything that doesn't excite you

### "What would this look like if it were easy?"
**Decision:** Overcoming complexity  
**Logic:** Often over-complicating due to ego/insecurity  
**Action:** Find simpler path

### "Will I regret NOT doing this at 80?"
**Decision:** Risk-taking, life experiments  
**Logic:** Regret minimization framework (Bezos)  
**Action:** If would regret inaction, do it

### "Excitement > Practicality"
**Decision:** Goal selection  
**Logic:** "What would excite me?" > "What should I do?"  
**Action:** Chase excitement, happiness follows

---

## Learning & Skill Acquisition

### "DiSSS before hours"
**Decision:** How to approach new skill  
**Logic:** Deconstruct, Select 20%, Sequence, Stakes  
**Action:** Systematic approach, not brute force hours

### "Minimum Effective Dose (MED)"
**Decision:** How much is enough?  
**Logic:** Smallest dose for desired outcome  
**Action:** Stop at MED, more ≠ better

### "Just-in-time learning"
**Decision:** What to learn when  
**Logic:** Learn what you'll use this week, not "just in case"  
**Action:** Google when needed, ignore rest

---

## Information & Attention

### "Low-information diet"
**Decision:** What media to consume  
**Logic:** News is 99% irrelevant, depressing, out of control  
**Action:** Avoid news, batch emails 2x/day, ask others to filter

### "Will this change my behavior?"
**Decision:** Whether to consume information  
**Logic:** If won't change action, it's entertainment not information  
**Action:** If no behavior change expected, skip it

---

## Relationships & Environment

### "You are the average of 5 people you spend time with"
**Decision:** Who to associate with  
**Logic:** Environment shapes you more than willpower  
**Action:** Choose companions deliberately

### "Poisonous people don't deserve your time"
**Decision:** Relationship boundaries  
**Logic:** Life too short for toxic relationships  
**Action:** Fire difficult clients/friends ruthlessly

---

## Fast Decision Rules

1. **"Start ridiculously small"** - Lower bar to start
2. **"Batch everything possible"** - Reduce context switching
3. **"Someday = Never"** - Act now or admit won't happen
4. **"3-6 month dreamlines, not 5-year goals"** - Shorter timeframes
5. **"Fear-setting for big decisions"** - Define worst case, prevent, repair, cost of inaction
6. **"Let silence do the work"** - Don't fill gaps in conversation
7. **"If not excited, it's a distraction"** - Ruthless focus
8. **"Make before manage"** - Create before admin
9. **"Win the morning, win the day"** - Morning routine sets tone
10. **"Track only vital few metrics"** - Not everything that counts can be counted

---

**Usage:** Apply these heuristics for fast, reliable decision-making without extensive analysis. Most tested through personal experience and iteration.
