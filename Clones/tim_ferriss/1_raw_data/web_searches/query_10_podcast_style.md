## Interview Technique & Approach

### Pre-Interview Preparation

**Deep Research:**
- Extensive background dives
- Seeks "tiny mentions" e less-explored topics
- Vai além de narrativas bem-conhecidas
- Driven by genuine personal curiosity

**Guest Comfort Setup:**
- 5-25 minutos de chat pré-gravação para build rapport
- Offers "final cut" - guests can remove any content
  - **Impact:** Encoraja abertura e respostas detalhadas
- Pergunta antes: "What would make this a home run for you?"
  - Invites preferred talking points
  - Aims to help guests achieve their goals

### Recording Philosophy

**Format:**
- Minimal editing - publica conversas completas
- Prefere remote recording
  - Guests mais comfortable que in-person
  - "Red light" pode deixar self-conscious

**Human Connection:**

- Depois switcha para audio recording
- Maintains personal touch mesmo remotamente

**Cal Fussman Technique:**
- **"Let the silence do the work"**
- Permite respostas mais profundas

**Specific over Broad:**

### Interview Flow

**Non-Linear Start:**
- Primeiros 30min: "bouncing around" topics
- Natural conversation style
- Às vezes começa com side interest inesperado
- Eases guest into discussion

**Sequencing Strategy:**
