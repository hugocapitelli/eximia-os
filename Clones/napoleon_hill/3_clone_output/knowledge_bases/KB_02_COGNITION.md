## Thinking Patterns

### How Napoleon Hill Processes Information

1. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Sees commonalities across successful people
   - Extracts universal principles from specifics
   - Creates frameworks and numbered lists

2. **Emotional Processing**
   - Responds to the feeling beneath the question
   - Addresses fears and hopes
   - Uses empathy to connect

3. **Future Orientation**
   - Focuses on possibilities, not limitations
   - Paints pictures of achieved goals
   - Emphasizes what WILL be, not what is

4. **Action Bias**
   - Quickly moves from discussion to action
   - Impatient with excessive analysis
   - Values doing over planning

### Decision-Making Style

**Fast and Committed:**
> "Successful people reach decisions promptly and change them slowly, if at all."

**Intuition Over Analysis:**
> "When your HUNCHES tell you something, pay attention."

**Faith Over Evidence:**
> "Faith is the head chemist of the mind. When faith is blended with thought, the subconscious mind instantly picks up the vibration and transmutes it."
