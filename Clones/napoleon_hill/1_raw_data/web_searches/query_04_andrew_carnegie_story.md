**Query:** "Napoleon Hill Andrew Carnegie interview story relationship mentorship"

## The Traditional Narrative

### The Legendary Meeting (1908)

According to Hill's famous account:

1. **The Assignment:** In 1908, Napoleon Hill was a young newspaper reporter assigned to interview Andrew Carnegie, the steel magnate and one of the most powerful men in the world.

2. **The Challenge:** Hill was warned that Carnegie did not do interviews. Undaunted, he went to Carnegie's office anyway.

3. **Persistence:** When turned down, Hill came back daily and sat in the reception area waiting.

4. **The Breakthrough:** Eventually, Carnegie agreed to meet. The interview was supposed to last 3 hours but extended to 3 days.

5. **The Commission:** Carnegie was so impressed that he challenged Hill to spend 20 years interviewing the world's most successful people and codify a "philosophy of success."

6. **The Introductions:** Carnegie allegedly provided letters of introduction to:
   - Henry Ford
   - Alexander Graham Bell
   - Thomas Edison
   - John D. Rockefeller
   - Charles Schwab
   - And others

7. **The Terms:** Carnegie reportedly offered no payment, only access - testing whether Hill had true desire and commitment.

### Hill's Claim

Hill stated that Carnegie said something like:
> "I'll introduce you to men who can help you get all the knowledge you need. Would you be willing to devote 20 years of your life to this research without pay, other than what you can earn for yourself?"

Hill claimed he answered "Yes" in 29 seconds (Carnegie was allegedly timing him).

## The Controversy

### Evidence Problems

| Claim | Issue |
|-------|-------|
| **No Documentation** | No letters, contracts, or records of meetings exist |
| **Carnegie's Silence** | Carnegie made no mention of Hill in any of his extensive writings |
| **Timing** | Hill didn't mention Carnegie until nearly a decade after Carnegie's 1919 death |
| **Name Pronunciation** | Hill pronounces "Carnegie" the American way; Carnegie pronounced it the Scottish way |
| **Biographer's Assessment** | David Nasaw (Carnegie's definitive biographer) found no evidence they ever met |

### Skeptical View

> "Whatever impression Hill left on Carnegie, the industrialist made no mention of the younger man in his writings. Nor did Hill begin making references to the fateful meeting until nearly a decade after Carnegie's death in 1919."

> "There are no known records of Hill's meetings with the famous men he claimed to have interviewed apart from a brief photo op with Edison."

### Supporting View

In 1925, Hill published "Law of Success" brochures in which he thanked Carnegie for:
- Personal mentorship
- The "secret to success"
- Suggesting the research project

In 1953, "The Wisdom of Andrew Carnegie as told to Napoleon Hill" was published with W. Clement Stone writing an introduction assuring readers of the interviews' authenticity.

## The Relationship's Alleged Impact

### What Hill Said He Learned from Carnegie

1. **The Master Mind Principle** - The idea that multiple minds working in harmony create exponential power

2. **Definiteness of Purpose** - The importance of having a single, clear goal

3. **The Philosophy of Achievement** - That success follows universal laws that can be studied and applied

4. **Going the Extra Mile** - Doing more than you're paid to do

5. **The Carnegie Formula** - The specific steps to transmute desire into wealth

### Carnegie's Supposed Philosophy (per Hill)

> "Any idea that is held in the mind, that is emphasized, that is either feared or revered, will begin at once to clothe itself in the most convenient and appropriate form available."

## Balanced Assessment

### Why It Might Be True
- Hill consistently maintained the story for decades
- Some details are specific and checkable
- Hill did become successful using these principles
- The Napoleon Hill Foundation maintains its authenticity

### Why It Might Be Fabricated
- Zero independent verification
- Carnegie's complete silence
- Hill's documented history of exaggeration
- Financial motivation to claim famous mentor

### The Middle Ground

Some historians suggest:
- Hill may have briefly met Carnegie at some event
- The "mentorship" was likely greatly exaggerated
- The principles themselves, regardless of origin, have helped millions
