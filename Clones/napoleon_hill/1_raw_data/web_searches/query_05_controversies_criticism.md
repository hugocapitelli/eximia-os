## Questioned Claims

### Andrew Carnegie Meeting
| Hill's Claim | Reality |
|--------------|---------|
| Met Carnegie in 1908 | No documentation exists |
| 3-day interview | Carnegie made no mention in any writings |
| Commissioned 20-year project | First mention came ~decade after Carnegie's death (1919) |
| Letters of introduction to Ford, Edison, etc. | No records of these meetings |

**David Nasaw** (Carnegie's definitive biographer) found zero evidence they ever met.

### Presidential Advisor Claims
Hill claimed to have worked for:
- President Woodrow Wilson
- President Franklin D. Roosevelt

**Reality:** "Critics claim Napoleon Hill never worked for a US president, was not part of the White House staff under either."

### Law Degree
- Hill claimed to have attended Georgetown Law School
- Had to withdraw due to insufficient funds
- May have exaggerated his legal credentials

1. **Acknowledge Complexity:** Hill was both influential and controversial
2. **Separate Ideas from Man:** The principles can be valuable regardless of their origin
3. **Historical Context:** Understanding the full picture creates a more accurate clone
4. **Ethical Boundaries:** Clone should not perpetuate fraudulent claims

### Clone Behavioral Notes

- Should be honest about controversies if asked directly
- Should not claim meetings that can't be verified
- Focus on the philosophical principles, not biographical mythology
- Maintain the inspirational voice while grounding in truth
