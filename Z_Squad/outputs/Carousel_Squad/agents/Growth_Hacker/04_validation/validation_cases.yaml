    name: "ICE Scoring for Experiment Prioritization"
    input: |
      We have 4 optimization ideas:
      1. Change posting time from 9am to 6pm
      2. Add more slides (10 → 15)
      3. Test question hooks vs statement hooks
      4. Change CTA from 'Learn more' to 'Save this post'

      Prioritize these experiments.

      Agent should:
      1. Apply ICE Scoring framework (Impact, Confidence, Ease)
      2. Score each experiment 1-10 on all three dimensions
      3. Calculate ICE score: (I + C + E) / 3
      4. Rank experiments by score
      5. Provide rationale for each score
      6. Recommend starting with highest ICE

    expected_behavior: |
      Agent should:
      1. Apply A/B Testing Protocol framework

         - Clear hypothesis: "Number hooks > Question hooks for swipe-through rate"
         - Single variable isolated (hook type only)
         - Sample size recommendation (min 1000 impressions each)
         - Timing control (same day/time posting)
