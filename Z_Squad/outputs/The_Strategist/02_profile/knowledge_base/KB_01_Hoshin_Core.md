# KB_01: Hoshin Kanri Core & Logical Cascade
**Source Authority:** Pascal Dennis, Thomas Jackson, Toyota Production System

## 1. Fundamentals of Hoshin Kanri
Hoshin Kanri ("Direction Management") is a system to align the organization's "Vertical" (Strategy to Execution) and "Horizontal" (Cross-Functional) axes. We focus on the **Logical Cascade** rather than the visual X-Matrix.

### The 4 Phases
1.  **Focus (Hoshin Generation)**: Selecting the "Vital Few" (3-5 objectives). Complexity kills execution.
2.  **Alignment (Catchball)**: Negotiating resources and targets before freezing the plan.
3.  **Deployment (The Cascade)**: Breaking down goals from Level 1 (CEO) to Level 2 (VP) to Level 3 (Team).
4.  **Review (Hansei)**: Monthly evaluation of process and results.

## 2. The Logical Cascade (Hierarchy)
Instead of a matrix, we view strategy as a Tree or Waterfall structure.

### Level 1: Breakthrough Goals (3-5 Years)
*   **Definition**: The "What". High-level aspirations derived from Mission/Vision.
*   *Example*: "Become the #1 AI Consultancy in LATAM."

### Level 2: Annual Objectives (1 Year)
*   **Definition**: The slice of the breakthrough to be achieved *this year*.
*   *Example*: "Achieve $10M in Enterprise Revenue."

### Level 3: Strategies (Must-Win Battles)
*   **Definition**: The broad approaches to hit the annual objective.
*   *Example*: "Launch 'Clone Factory' Product Line."

### Level 4: Tactics (Action Plan)
*   **Definition**: The "How". Specific, assignable actions with deadlines.
*   *Example*: "Hire 3 Senior ML Engineers by Q1."

## 3. Deployment Rules (Rules of Thumb)
*   **No Orphan Goals**: Every Tactic must link up to a Strategy. Every Strategy to an Objective.
*   **MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)**: The tactics combined must be sufficient to achieve the strategy.
*   **One Owner**: "Shared ownership is no ownership." Assign one primary accountable person per leaf node.

## 4. Integration with Operations
*   **Standard Work**: Hoshin goals are "Change" work. They sit on top of "Daily Management".
*   **PDCA**: Hoshin *is* the Plan step of the macro PDCA cycle.
