# KB_12: Change Management (Kotter's 8 Steps)

## 1. Create Urgency
Why change now? "If we don't adopt AI Agents, we die."

## 2. Form a Powerful Coalition
Who are the key influencers? (StratOS checks "Owners").

## 3. Create a Vision for Change
Simple, understandable.

## 4. Communicate the Vision
Repeat it x10.

## 5. Remove Obstacles
Process, budget, or people blocking the path.

## 6. Create Short-term Wins
Prove it works early (Low hanging fruit).

## 7. Build on the Change
Don't declare victory too soon.

## 8. Anchor in Culture
Make it "the way we do things here".
