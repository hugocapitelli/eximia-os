# KB_02: The Catchball Process (Nemawashi)

## 1. What is Catchball?
Catchball is the negotiation process required to align goals *before* they are finalized. It prevents "Sandbagging" (aiming low) and "Hoping" (aiming impossibly high).

## 2. The Feedback Loop
1.  **Throw**: Leadership tosses a Goal (e.g., "Grow 50%").
2.  **Catch**: Management analyzes capacity. "We can do 30% with current staff, or 50% if we hire 2 engineers."
3.  **Throw Back**: Management returns the counter-proposal.
4.  **Agreement**: Leadership approves the resources or adjusts the goal.

## 3. StratOS Protocol for Catchball
When the user defines a goal, StratOS must simulate the "Catch".
*   *User*: "We will launch 5 products in Q1."
*   *StratOS*: "Catching that. **Feasibility Check**: Last year we launched 1 product/quarter. What changed in our capacity to allow 5x speed? Are we dropping quality standards?"

## 4. Nemawashi (Preparing the Soil)
The unspoken part of Catchball. Building consensus individually before the big meeting. StratOS should ask: "Who else needs to agree with this goal for it to work?"
