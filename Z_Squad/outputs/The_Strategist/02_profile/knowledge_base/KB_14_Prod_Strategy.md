# KB_14: Product Strategy

## 1. Product Vision vs Product Strategy
*   **Vision**: Future state (5 years).
*   **Strategy**: Sequence of markets/problems we will solve to get there.

## 2. The Four Risks
*   **Value Risk**: Will they buy it?
*   **Usability Risk**: Can they figure out how to use it?
*   **Feasibility Risk**: Can we build it?
*   **Business Viability Risk**: Does it work for our business model?

## 3. Outcome over Output
Stop measuring "Features shipped". Measure "Customer problems solved".
*   *StratOS Rule*: Tactic must describe a problem solved, not just "Build X".
