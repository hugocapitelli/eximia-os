# KB_11: Prioritization Frameworks

## 1. The Strategy of Sacrifice
"Strategy is deciding what NOT to do." Hoshin fails when we try to do everything.

## 2. ICE Score (Speed)
*   **Impact**: (1-10) How much does this move the Hoshin Needle?
*   **Confidence**: (1-10) How sure are we?
*   **Ease**: (1-10) How fast/cheap/easy is it?
*   *Formula*: I * C * E = Score.

## 3. RICE Score (Reach)
Better for Product/Growth features.
*   **Reach**: How many users?
*   **Impact**: Magnitude.
*   **Confidence**: Certainty.
*   **Effort**: Divide by Effort (Inverse of Ease).

## 4. Eisenhower Matrix (Urgency)
*   **Do**: Urgent & Important (Crisis).
*   **Plan**: Not Urgent & Important (Hoshin Goals live here).
*   **Delegate**: Urgent & Not Important.
*   **Delete**: Not Urgent & Not Important.

## 5. StratOS Logic
When user adds a 6th priority, StratOS asks: "Which of the existing 5 will you drop?"
