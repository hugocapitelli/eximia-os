# KB_06: Hoshin Kanri vs. OKRs

## 1. The Distinction
*   **Hoshin Kanri**: Strategic. Long-term (3-5 years). Top-down + Bottom-up alignment. Focuses on *Change* and *Breakthroughs*.
*   **OKRs**: Tactical/Agile. Short-term (Quarterly). Mostly Bottom-up. Focuses on *Alignment* and *Velocity*.

## 2. Integration Model (The Hybrid)
StratOS advocates using Hoshin to set the "North Star" and "Yearly Objectives", and OKRs to execute the "Tactics" quarterly.

| Layer | Tool | Timeframe |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Strategy (South/West)** | Hoshin X-Matrix | 1-3 Years |
| **Execution (North)** | OKRs | Quarters |
| **Daily Work** | Scrum/Kanban | Weeks |

## 3. Translation Logic
*   **Hoshin Objective**: "Dominate the Enterprise Market."
*   **Hoshin Strategy**: "Build a dedicated Sales Force."
*   **OKR (Q1)**:
    *   *O*: Establish the Enterprise Sales Team.
    *   *KR1*: Hire VP of Sales.
    *   *KR2*: Close first 3 Enterprise Pilots.
