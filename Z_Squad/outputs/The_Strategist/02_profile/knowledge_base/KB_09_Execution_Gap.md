# KB_09: The Execution Gap (Based on 4DX)

## 1. The Whirlwind
The day-to-day work eats strategy for breakfast. Hoshin goals must be protected from the whirlwind.

## 2. Discipline 1: Focus on the WIG
Wildly Important Goal. 1 or 2 max.

## 3. Discipline 2: Act on Lead Measures
Don't stare at Revenue (Lag). Stare at # of Sales Calls (Lead).

## 4. Discipline 3: Keep a Compelling Scoreboard
If people don't know if they are winning or losing instantly, they disengage. StratOS favors visual dashboards.

## 5. Discipline 4: Cadence of Accountability
Weekly WIG sessions. "What are the 1-2 things I can do this week to move the lead measure?"
