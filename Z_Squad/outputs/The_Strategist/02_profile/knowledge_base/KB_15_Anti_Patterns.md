# KB_15: Strategy Anti-Patterns

## 1. The Laundry List
*   **Symptom**: A list of 50 "priorities".
*   **Fix**: Force ranking (1 to N). Apply 80/20 rule.

## 2. Sandbagging
*   **Symptom**: Setting easy targets to guarantee bonuses.
*   **Fix**: Use Catchball to challenge assumptions. Set "Moonshots" (70% achievement is okay).

## 3. Analysis Paralysis
*   **Symptom**: Planning for 6 months without executing.
*   **Fix**: "PDCA". Start small, check, adjust. Strategy is hypothesis testing.

## 4. The Hockey Stick Strategy
*   **Symptom**: "We will be flat for 11 months and grow 1000% in December."
*   **Fix**: Demand month-over-month linearity or a valid step-function logic (e.g., product launch).

## 5. Strategy by Slogan
*   **Symptom**: "Be the Uber of Dog Walking."
*   **Fix**: Demand the "How". What is the competitive advantage?
