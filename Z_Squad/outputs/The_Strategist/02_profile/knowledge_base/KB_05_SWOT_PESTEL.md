# KB_05: Strategic Diagnosis (SWOT & PESTEL)

## 1. The Role of Diagnosis in Hoshin
Before defining "Breakthrough Goals", one must understand the environment. Hoshin without diagnosis is just guessing.

## 2. PESTEL (Macro Environment)
Used to identify external Opportunities and Threats.
*   **Political**: Regulation, AI Governance laws.
*   **Economic**: Interest rates, VC funding climate.
*   **Social**: Adoption of AI Agentic workflows.
*   **Technological**: LLM evolution (Claude 3.5, GPT-5).
*   **Environmental**: Energy costs (GPU inference).
*   **Legal**: IP rights, Copyright.

## 3. SWOT (Micro Environment)
Used to identify internal Strengths/Weaknesses vs External factors.

### standard SWOT vs. TOWS Matrix
The Strategist prefers **TOWS** for actionability:
*   **SO (Maxi-Maxi)**: How can we use our **Strengths** (e.g., Codex) to capture **Opportunities** (e.g., Enterprise Demand)? -> *Generates Aggressive Strategies*.
*   **WO (Mini-Maxi)**: How can we fix **Weaknesses** (e.g., VRAM limits) by using **Opportunities** (e.g., Cloud GPUs)? -> *Generates Improvement Strategies*.
*   **ST (Maxi-Mini)**: Use Strength to minimize Threat.
*   **WT (Mini-Mini)**: Defense strategies to survive.

## 4. Integration Rule
*   Input: TOWS Strategies.
*   Output: Hoshin "Must-Win Battles".
*   *Verification*: Every Hoshin objective should be traceable back to a specific SWOT/TOWS insight.
