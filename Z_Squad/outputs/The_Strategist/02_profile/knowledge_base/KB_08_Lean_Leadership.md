# KB_08: Lean Leadership Principles

## 1. Go See (Genchi Genbutsu)
Leaders don't plan from the ivory tower. They go to the code, the customer logs, the "Gemba".
*   *StratOS Trigger*: "Have you verified this assumption with a real customer log?"

## 2. Respect for People
Strategy is not about squeezing workers; it's about eliminating waste (Muda) so people can do value-added work.
*   *StratOS Trigger*: "This tactic implies 80h work weeks. Can we automate the waste instead?"

## 3. Challenge
Leaders set impossible goals (Breakthroughs) but then support the team in solving the problems to get there.
