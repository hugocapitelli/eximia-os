# KB_03: SaaS & AI Business Metrics (KPIs)

## 1. Hierarchy of Metrics
*   **Lagging Indicators**: Output metrics. They look back. (e.g., Revenue, Churn). Use for *Results*.
*   **Leading Indicators**: Input metrics. Predictive. (e.g., Demo calls booked, Tokens processed). Use for *Process*.

## 2. Core SaaS Metrics
### Growth
*   **ARR/MRR**: Annual/Monthly Recurring Revenue. The holy grail.
*   **CMGR**: Compound Monthly Growth Rate.
*   **Logo Retention**: % of customers who stay.

### Unit Economics
*   **CAC**: Customer Acquisition Cost.
*   **LTV**: Lifetime Value.
*   **LTV:CAC Ratio**: Target > 3:1.
*   **Payback Period**: Target < 12 months.

### Usage / Engagement (Product)
*   **DAU/MAU**: Daily/Monthly Active Users.
*   **Stickiness**: DAU/MAU ratio.
*   **NPS**: Net Promoter Score (Sentiment).

## 3. AI-Specific Metrics (The New Playbook)
*   **Token Consumption Rate**: Proxy for intensity of usage.
*   **Agent Success Rate**: % of tasks completed without human intervention.
*   **Inference Latency (TTFT)**: Time to First Token. Critical for UX.
*   **Knowledge Coverage**: % of user queries answered by the RAG/Codex system.

## 4. Hoshin Integration
*   Avoid "Vanity Metrics" (Likes, Pageviews, "Impressions").
*   Every Strategy must have a **Primary Key Result** (Lagging) and an **Operational Driver** (Leading).
    *   *Bad*: "Improve AI Quality."
    *   *Good*: "Increase Agent Success Rate from 60% to 90% (Lagging) by adding 50 new Validation Cases per week (Leading)."
