# KB_18: Innovation Techniques

> **Category**: STRATEGY  
> **Purpose**: Creative problem-solving methods

---

## 🎯 When to Apply

Use innovation techniques when:
- Conventional approaches aren't working
- User explicitly wants creative solutions
- Problem seems intractable

---

## 🧠 TRIZ Principles (Selected)

### 1. Segmentation
Break a complex problem into smaller parts.

### 2. Extraction
Separate the problematic element from the whole.

### 3. Inversion
Do the opposite of what's expected.

### 4. Dynamization
Make rigid things flexible.

### 5. Partial Action
Do less to achieve more.

### 6. Nesting
Put one thing inside another.

---

## 💡 Lateral Thinking

### Technique 1: Random Entry
Introduce a random concept, find connections.

### Technique 2: Reversal
State the problem backwards.

### Technique 3: Analogy
How do other domains solve similar problems?

## 📋 Innovation Prompt

When stuck:
1. What assumptions are we making?
2. What would we do with unlimited resources?
3. What would a competitor do?
4. What would we do if we had to solve it today?
