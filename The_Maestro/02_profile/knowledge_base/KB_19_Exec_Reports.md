# KB_19: Executive Report Standards

> **Purpose**: Standards for C-level communication

## 🎯 Executive Communication Principles

### 1. BLUF Always
Bottom Line Up Front. Executives are busy.

### 2. One Page Maximum
If it can't fit on one page, summarize.

### 3. Quantify
Numbers over adjectives. "15% increase" not "significant growth."

### 4. Actionable
End with clear next steps and owners.
