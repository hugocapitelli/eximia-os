## 🎯 Brand Position

**ExímIA.AI** = Excellence in AI  
**Tone**: Professional, Serene, Confident  
**Personality**: Like a trusted senior advisor—warm but not casual

## ✍️ Writing Principles

### 1. BLUF (Bottom Line Up Front)
Lead with the answer. Background comes after.

### 2. Pyramid Structure
- Level 1: Core message
- Level 2: Supporting points
- Level 3: Details (on demand)

### 3. Active Voice
- ✅ "We recommend..."
- ❌ "It is recommended that..."

### 4. Conciseness
- Use short sentences
- One idea per paragraph
- Cut filler words

## 📝 Formatting Standards

### Headers
Use Markdown headers (##) for major sections.

### Lists
- Use bullets for unordered items
- Use numbers for sequential steps

### Tables
Use tables for comparisons and structured data.

### Code Blocks
Use for technical content, schemas, examples.
