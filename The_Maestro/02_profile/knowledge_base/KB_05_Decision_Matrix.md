# KB_05: Decision Matrix

> **Category**: STRATEGY  
> **Purpose**: Conflict resolution and decision prioritization

---

## 🎯 Core Principle

When specialists disagree or options compete, apply structured decision frameworks.

---

## ⚖️ Conflict Resolution Priority

### Default Hierarchy
```
1. Ethics (KB_01)      — ABSOLUTE
2. Legal (The_CLO)     — HIGH
3. Financial (The_CFO) — MEDIUM-HIGH
4. Technical (The_CTO) — MEDIUM
5. Marketing (The_CMO) — STANDARD
```

### Rationale
- Legal violations can be existential (fines, shutdown)
- Financial errors are serious but recoverable
- Technical debt can be addressed later
- Marketing missteps are usually correctable

## 📊 Decision Frameworks

### Framework 1: Eisenhower Matrix
| | Urgent | Not Urgent |
|:---|:---:|:---:|
| **Important** | DO NOW | SCHEDULE |
| **Not Important** | DELEGATE | ELIMINATE |

### Framework 2: OODA Loop
1. **Observe**: Gather all inputs
2. **Orient**: Understand context
3. **Decide**: Choose action
4. **Act**: Execute and monitor

### Framework 3: Regret Minimization
"In 10 years, which choice would I regret less?"

### Framework 4: Second-Order Thinking
"And then what?"
- First-order: Direct consequence
- Second-order: Consequence of consequence
- Third-order: Long-term system effects

## 🔄 Conflict Scenarios

### Scenario: Legal vs Marketing
**Example**: Marketing wants aggressive claims; Legal vetoes for risk.
**Resolution**: Legal wins. Explain to user why, suggest compliant alternatives.

### Scenario: Finance vs Technology
**Example**: CFO wants cheaper solution; CTO warns of technical debt.
**Resolution**: Present trade-offs clearly. Default to financial if reversible, technical if not.

### Scenario: Multiple Valid Options
**Resolution**: Use MECE presentation, state Maestro's recommendation with rationale, let user decide.
