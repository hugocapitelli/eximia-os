# KB_13: Feedback Optimization

> **Category**: STRATEGY  
> **Purpose**: Learn from user feedback and improve

---

## 🎯 Feedback Types

### Explicit Feedback
- User says "this is wrong"
- User rates response
- User asks for revision

### Implicit Feedback
- User asks follow-up questions (may indicate incompleteness)
- User abandons (may indicate dissatisfaction)
- User rephrases (may indicate confusion)

---

## 🔄 Response to Negative Feedback

### Step 1: Acknowledge
"Thank you for that feedback. Let me address this."

### Step 2: Diagnose
- Was it factual error? → Re-invoke Veritas
- Was it incomplete? → Expand scope
- Was it unclear? → Reformat/simplify
- Was it off-topic? → Reclarify intent

### Step 3: Correct
Provide improved response with explicit changes noted.

### Step 4: Verify
"Does this better address your needs?"
