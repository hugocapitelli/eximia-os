# Task: Create Squad Task

**Task ID:** create-task
**Version:** 2.0
**Purpose:** Create a single workflow task following Task Anatomy standard (8 fields)
**Orchestrator:** @squad-architect
**Mode:** Elicitation-based (interactive)
**Quality Standard:** AIOS Level (300+ lines simple, 500+ lines complex)

**Frameworks Used:**
- `data/executor-matrix-framework.md` → Executor assignment (Phase 2)
- `data/decision-heuristics-framework.md` → Quality gate logic (Phase 4)
- `data/quality-dimensions-framework.md` → Task validation (Phase 4)

---

## Overview

This task creates a single workflow task for an AIOS squad. The key insight: **every task must follow the Task Anatomy standard (8 fields) for consistency and quality**.

**v2.0 Changes:**
- Mandatory Task Anatomy (8 fields)
- PHASE-based structure with checkpoints
- Executor assignment using executor-matrix-framework
- Quality gate SC_TSK_001 must pass
- Clear distinction: Task (atomic) vs Workflow (multi-phase)

```

---

## PHASE 0: CLASSIFICATION

**Duration:** 2-5 minutes
**Checkpoint:** None (fast classification)
**Mode:** Interactive

### Step 0.1: Task vs Workflow Decision

**Apply: quality_standards.workflow_vs_task_decision**

**Actions:**
```yaml
classification_criteria:
  create_WORKFLOW_when:
    - operation_has_3plus_phases: true
    - multiple_agents_involved: true
    - spans_multiple_sessions: true
    - needs_intermediate_checkpoints: true
    - output_from_one_phase_feeds_next: true

  create_TASK_when:
    - atomic_single_session: true
    - single_agent_sufficient: true
    - no_intermediate_checkpoints: true

  decision_tree:
    - IF any workflow criteria met → "Create workflow, not task"
    - ELSE → "Task is appropriate"
```

**Elicitation:**
```yaml
elicit_classification:
  question: "Let's classify this operation. Tell me about it:"

  sub_questions:
    - "Does it have multiple distinct phases (3+)?"
    - "Does it require multiple agents to work together?"
    - "Will it span multiple work sessions?"
    - "Does it need checkpoints between steps?"

  decision:
    if_workflow: "This should be a WORKFLOW. Use *create-workflow instead."
    if_task: "This is correctly a TASK. Let's continue."
```

### Step 0.2: Identify Target Pack

**Actions:**
```yaml
identify_pack:
  validation:
    - check_path: "squads/{pack_name}/"
    - check_exists: true
    - load_config: "config.yaml"
    - identify_agents: "List agents that could execute this task"

  on_not_exists:
    - suggest: "Create squad first with *create-squad"
    - option: "Create task standalone (not recommended)"
```

### Step 0.3: Assign Executor Type

**Apply: executor-matrix-framework.md**

**Actions:**
```yaml
assign_executor:
  decision_tree:
    - IF rule_based AND low_stakes:
        executor: "Worker"
        description: "Fully automated, deterministic"
        example: "Data formatting, file operations"

    - ELSE IF high_judgment_required:
        executor: "Human"
        description: "Requires human decision-making"
        example: "Final approval, creative direction"

    - ELSE IF ai_can_draft_human_validates:
        executor: "Hybrid"
        description: "AI creates draft, human reviews/approves"
        example: "Content generation, analysis"

    - ELSE:
        executor: "Agent"
        description: "AI executes autonomously"
        example: "Research, synthesis, first drafts"

  guardrails_required:
    Worker: "Input validation, error handling"
    Agent: "Quality checks, confidence thresholds"
    Hybrid: "Human review triggers, approval workflow"
    Human: "Clear instructions, decision criteria"
```

**Output (PHASE 0):**
```yaml
phase_0_output:
  classification: "task"
  pack_name: "copy"
  pack_path: "squads/copy/"
  task_id: "generate-sales-page"
  executor: "Hybrid"
  executor_rationale: "AI generates draft, human reviews for brand voice"
```

## PHASE 1: TASK ANATOMY

**Duration:** 10-15 minutes
**Checkpoint:** SC_ANA_001 (Anatomy Complete)
**Mode:** Interactive (elicitation)

### Step 1.1: Define Field 1-2 (ID & Purpose)

**Elicitation:**
```yaml
elicit_identity:
  field_1_id:
    question: "What should be the task ID? (kebab-case)"
    example: "generate-sales-page"
    validation: "Must be unique within pack"

  field_2_purpose:
    question: "What is the purpose of this task?"
    prompt: "Complete: 'This task exists to...'"
    example: "Generate high-converting sales page copy following proven copywriting frameworks"
    requirements:
      - "Clear goal statement"
      - "Value proposition"
      - "Measurable outcome if possible"
```

### Step 1.2: Define Field 3 (Executor)

**Use result from Phase 0, Step 0.3**

**Elicitation (confirmation):**
```yaml
elicit_executor:
  present: "Based on analysis, I recommend: {executor}"
  rationale: "{executor_rationale}"
  question: "Does this executor assignment make sense?"

  if_disagree:
    options:
      - "Human - I need full human control"
      - "Agent - Let AI handle it fully"
      - "Hybrid - AI drafts, I review"
      - "Worker - It's purely mechanical"

  guardrails_prompt:
    - "What guardrails should be in place for this executor?"
```

### Step 1.3: Define Field 4 (Inputs)

  for_each_input:
    - "What is the input name?"
    - "What type is it? (string, file, object, list)"
    - "Is it required or optional?"
    - "Where does it come from? (user, previous task, database, API)"
    - "How should it be validated?"

  examples:
    - name: "product_description"
      type: "string"
      required: true
      source: "user"
      validation: "Min 50 characters"

    - name: "target_audience"
      type: "object"
      required: true
      source: "previous_task (avatar-research)"

      - "What research must be done?"

    system_prerequisites:
      - "What tools or systems must be available?"
      - "What permissions are needed?"

    sequence_prerequisites:
      - "What tasks must complete first?"

    - "[ ] Product description available (50+ chars)"
    - "[ ] Target audience research complete"
    - "[ ] Brand voice guide accessible"
    - "[ ] Agent has copywriting framework loaded"
```

### Step 1.5: Define Field 6 (Steps)

**Elicitation:**
```yaml
elicit_steps:
  question: "Let's break down the workflow. What are the main steps?"

  for_each_step:
    - name: "Step name (action verb)"
    - action: "What exactly should happen"
    - elicit: "Does this step need user input? (true/false)"
    - output: "What does this step produce"
    - conditions: "Any conditional logic"

  structure_guidance:
    simple_task:
      - "3-7 steps"

    - name: "Generate Headline Options"
      action: "Create 5 headline variations"
      elicit: false
      output: "5 headlines with rationale"
```

### Step 1.6: Define Field 7 (Outputs)

**Elicitation:**
```yaml
elicit_outputs:
  question: "What does this task produce?"

  for_each_output:
    - name: "Output name"
    - format: "markdown | yaml | json | file"
    - location: "Where to save (pattern allowed)"
    - structure: "What sections/fields"

  primary_output:

    secondary:
      name: "headline-options"
      format: "yaml"
      location: "outputs/{project}/headlines.yaml"
```

### Step 1.7: Define Field 8 (Validation)

**Elicitation:**
```yaml
elicit_validation:
  question: "How do we know this task completed successfully?"

  categories:
    completeness:
      - "Are all required sections present?"
      - "Are minimum lengths met?"

    quality:
      - "Does output meet quality standards?"
      - "Does it follow the framework correctly?"

    domain_specific:
      - "Does it include required elements for this domain?"
      - "Does it avoid known anti-patterns?"

    format:
      - "Is the structure correct?"
      - "Is the file format valid?"

  blocking_vs_warning:
    blocking:
      - "Failures that prevent task from completing"
      - "Must be fixed before output is valid"

    warning:
      - "Issues that should be noted but don't block"
      - "Recommendations for improvement"

  example_validation:
    blocking:
      - "Headline present"
      - "CTA present"
      - "Min 500 words"

    warning:
      - "Social proof section recommended"
      - "Consider adding PS"
```

**Checkpoint SC_ANA_001:**
```yaml
heuristic_id: SC_ANA_001
name: "Task Anatomy Complete"
blocking: true
