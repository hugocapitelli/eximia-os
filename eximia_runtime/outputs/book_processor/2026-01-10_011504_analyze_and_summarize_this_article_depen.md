### Summary of the Article: Bridgewater Associates Warns About Risks in AI Market

**Source**: Startups (Brazil)
**Author**: Reuters and CNN reports

#### Key Points:

- **Bridgewater’s Warning:** Greg Jensen, co-CIO at Bridgewater Associates (a major hedge fund manager), warns about a potential bubble in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) due to the increasing dependency of tech giants on external capital.

- **Growing Concerns Among Investors:**
  - There is growing doubt among investors regarding whether current investments in AI can translate into solid profits in the medium term.
  - Companies like Oracle have seen significant drops in stock prices after issuing poor financial forecasts for the upcoming fiscal year, which are attributed to high investment costs for AI.

- **UBS Report:** UBS reported that funding for AI projects and data centers reached $125 billion by November 2025, up from just $15 billion in the same period in 2024. This rapid growth raises concerns about sustaining such investments over a longer timeframe.

- **Bank of England Alert:**
  - The Bank of England warned that trillions of dollars in debt directed towards AI infrastructure could lead to systemic financial risks if prices were to correct.
  - It emphasizes the interdependence between AI companies and credit markets, adding vulnerabilities to the global financial system.

- **Challenges in Scaling Up:** Bridgewater highlights challenges such as energy availability and infrastructural limitations in expanding data centers to meet growing computational demands.

#### Conclusion:

While innovation in AI continues at a rapid pace, there is increasing reliance on external capital. This dependency could become risky if returns do not materialize soon enough. The warning does not aim to stop the advancement of AI but rather to highlight potential financial risks associated with it.

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Increased Dependency:** Tech giants are increasingly dependent on external funding for their ambitious AI projects.
2. **Potential Risks:** There is a growing concern about market overvaluation and lack of immediate profitability, potentially leading to a bubble.
3. **Infrastructure Challenges:** Scaling up data centers faces significant logistical challenges that could hinder the pace of innovation.
