# KB_03: Theological Frameworks & Interpretive Approaches

## Introduction

This knowledge base documents major theological frameworks, interpretive approaches, and church traditions. Understanding these helps readers interpret scripture within proper context and recognize diverse valid perspectives.

## Major Theological Traditions

### 1. Reformed Theology (Calvinism)

**Core Emphases**:
- God's sovereignty in salvation (predestination)
- Total depravity of human nature
- Limited atonement (Christ died specifically for the elect)

**Key Figures**: John Calvin, John Owen, Charles Spurgeon, R.C. Sproul

**Scriptural Foundation**:

**Modern Expression**: Presbyterian, Reformed, many evangelical churches

---

### 2. Arminian Theology (Wesleyanism)

**Core Emphases**:
- Prevenient grace (God's grace precedes saving faith)
- Free will preserved in salvation (humans must respond to grace)

**Interpretive Style**:

### 3. Catholic Theology

**Modern Expression**: Roman Catholic, Eastern Catholic churches

---

### 4. Orthodox Theology (Eastern Orthodoxy)

**Core Emphases**:
- Theosis (deification—humans become like God)

- Active evangelism (spreading gospel)
- Commitment to mission

**Key Characteristics**: Cross-denominational movement rather than single tradition

**Scriptural Foundation**:
- Romans 3:23-26 (Substitutionary atonement)

## Hermeneutical Approaches

### 1. Historical-Grammatical Method

**Approach**: Understand scripture in its historical, cultural, and grammatical context

**Key Principles**:
- Understand original historical setting
- Analyze grammatical structure carefully
- Recognize literary genre
- Consider original language nuances
- Apply historically appropriate interpretation

**Strengths**: Rigorous, evidence-based, avoids arbitrary interpretation

**Example**: Understanding "demon-possessed" requires knowledge of 1st-century Jewish cosmology

---

### 2. Allegorical/Spiritual Method

**Approach**: Scripture has deeper spiritual meaning beyond literal sense

**Key Principles**:
- Look for symbolic meaning in historical accounts
- Connect OT types to NT fulfillment
- Find spiritual significance in numbers, names, events
- Recognize layered meaning (literal, moral, allegorical, anagogical)

**Strengths**: Honors depth of scripture, connects Old/New Testament

**Challenges**: Can lead to arbitrary interpretation without controls

**Example**: 40 days in wilderness = 40 years in desert (testing, preparation pattern)

---

### 3. Literal/Plain Sense Method

**Approach**: Take scripture at face value unless context clearly indicates otherwise

**Key Principles**:
- Assume straightforward meaning unless metaphor is indicated
- Recognize symbolism when clearly marked
- Don't spiritualize what is meant literally
- Scripture interprets scripture

**Strengths**: Avoids excessive speculation, provides stability

**Challenges**: Can miss intentional symbolism and metaphor

**Example**: "This is my body" in communion—debate about literal vs. symbolic

---

### 4. Covenantal Method

**Approach**: Understand scripture through lens of God's covenants with humanity

**Key Covenants**:
- Edenic Covenant (creation order)
- Noahic Covenant (preservation)
- Abrahamic Covenant (blessing to nations)
- Mosaic Covenant (law, national identity)
- Davidic Covenant (eternal kingship)
- New Covenant (Christ's redemption)

**Application**: Each passage interpreted within covenant framework

---

### 5. Narrative/Story Method

**Approach**: See scripture as overarching story of redemption

**Key Movements**:
1. **Creation** (God made us for relationship)
2. **Fall** (Sin broken that relationship)
3. **Redemption** (Jesus restores relationship)
4. **Consummation** (Eternal kingdom established)

**Application**: Each passage fits within larger narrative arc

---

## Interpretive Issues (Diverse Perspectives)

### Predestination vs. Free Will

**Debate**: Does God predestine who will be saved, or does human choice matter?

**Reformed Position**: God's sovereign predestination overrides human choice
**Arminian Position**: Human free will preserved; God foreknows but doesn't force
**Open Theism Position**: God knows possibilities but not actualilties (controversial)

**Key Passages**:
- Romans 8:29-30 (Predestined)
- 1 Timothy 2:4 (God wants all saved)
- Revelation 22:17 (Whoever wishes, take free gift)

---

### Inerrancy vs. Infallibility vs. Fallibility

**Inerrancy**: Scripture contains no errors in original autographs (conservative evangelical view)
**Infallibility**: Scripture is reliable on faith/salvation, may have minor historical errors (moderate view)
**Fallibility**: Scripture has errors like any human document but remains spiritually authoritative (progressive view)

**Key Question**: Can scripture have historical inaccuracies yet be spiritually true?

---

### Old Testament Law: Continuing or Fulfilled?

**Continuationist**: Moral law continues; ceremonial/civil law fulfilled in Christ
**Dispensational**: Different laws for different ages; OT laws don't apply to church
**Theonomic**: God's law should guide all civil/moral issues today

**Key Passages**:
- Matthew 5:17 (Jesus fulfills law)
- Galatians 3:24 (Law as tutor)
- Romans 6:14 (Not under law but grace)
- James 2:10 (James requires observance)

---

### Spiritual Gifts: Cessationist vs. Continuationist

**Cessationist**: Miraculous gifts (tongues, prophecy) ceased with apostolic age
**Continuationist**: All gifts continue until Christ returns
**Open but Cautious**: Gifts possible but rare and to be tested carefully

**Key Passages**:
- 1 Corinthians 13:8-10 (Love never fails, prophecies will cease)
- 1 Corinthians 12:7-11 (Gifts distributed as Spirit wills)
- Acts 2-19 (Historical pattern of continuation)

---

### End Times: Premillennial vs. Amillennial vs. Postmillennial

**Premillennial**: Rapture, tribulation, Christ returns, 1000-year kingdom
**Amillennial**: No literal 1000-year kingdom; Christ returns at end of age
**Postmillennial**: Gospel gradually Christianizes world, Christ returns after 1000 years of peace

**Related Debate**: Pre-trib, mid-trib, or post-tribulation rapture timing?

---

## Using Theological Frameworks

### When Reading Scripture

1. **Identify the framework**: What tradition/approach shapes this interpretation?
2. **Understand the reasoning**: What biblical foundation supports it?
3. **Recognize alternatives**: What other valid interpretations exist?
4. **Choose thoughtfully**: Which framework best fits textual evidence?
5. **Remain humble**: Acknowledge fallibility of human interpretation

### When Studying with Others

- Respect different valid frameworks
- Don't assume your tradition is the only valid reading
- Look for common ground beneath differences
- Focus on core doctrines (most traditions agree) vs. secondary issues
- Let scripture speak when frameworks conflict
