## Translation Philosophy Explained

### Word-for-Word (Formal Equivalence)
- Prioritizes literal correspondence to original language
- Each word in English corresponds to specific word in original
- Examples: KJV, NKJV, NASB, ESV
- **Strengths**: Precision, word study, theological accuracy
- **Challenges**: Sometimes awkward English, harder to understand

### Thought-for-Thought (Dynamic Equivalence)
- Prioritizes conveying the meaning of phrases and ideas
- Doesn't worry about word-for-word correspondence
- Examples: NTLH, NVT
- **Strengths**: Readability, clarity, natural flow
- **Challenges**: Some nuance can be lost, interpretation more visible

### Balanced Approach
- Attempts to balance literal accuracy with readability
- Word-for-word where possible, thought-for-thought where necessary
- Examples: ARA, NIV
- **Strengths**: Good balance of accuracy and readability
- **Challenges**: Can satisfy neither literalists nor readability advocates

## Using Multiple Translations

### John 3:16 Comparison

| Translation | Key Phrase | Philosophy |
|---|---|---|
| KJV | "only begotten Son" | Formal, literal |
| ACF | "Filho unigênito" | Formal, literal |
| ARA | "Filho unigênito" | Balanced |
| NTLH | "Filho único" | Dynamic, clear |
| NVT | "Filho único" | Contemporary |
| NKJV | "only begotten Son" | Formal modern |
| ESV | "only Son" | Formal modern |
| NASB | "only begotten Son" | Most literal |
| NIV | "one and only Son" | Balanced |

**Insight**: "Only begotten" emphasizes uniqueness and special relationship. Modern translations simplify to "only" or "one and only" while preserving the meaning.
