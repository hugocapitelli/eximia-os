tier_system:
  philosophy: |
    Tiers organize copywriters by FUNCTION, not quality.
    Each tier has a specific role in the copy creation workflow.
    ALWAYS start with Tier 0 for diagnosis before execution.

    name: "Foundation & Diagnosis"
    purpose: "ALWAYS first — diagnose before writing"
    agents: ["claude-hopkins", "eugene-schwartz", "robert-collier"]

    purpose: "High-performance copy execution"
    agents: ["gary-halbert", "gary-bencivenga", "david-ogilvy", "john-carlton", "clayton-makepeace", "parris-lampropoulos"]

  tier_2:
    name: "Modern Systematizers"
    purpose: "Reproducible frameworks and systems"
    agents: ["dan-kennedy", "todd-brown", "stefan-georgi"]
