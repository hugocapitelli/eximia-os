summary: |
  Created comprehensive mental DNA profile for The_Prototyper (ProtoOS),
  an Executive-tier Product Management agent. Extracted cognitive patterns
  from 4 mentor clones (Marty Cagan, Teresa Torres, Ken Norton, Ryan Singer).
  Built style guide with bilingual support (PT-BR/EN) and 5 knowledge bases
  covering PRD templates, PRP structure, RICE prioritization, customer
  discovery, and wireframing techniques.

key_decisions:
  - decision: "4 mentor clones selected"
    rationale: "Marty Cagan (discovery), Teresa Torres (continuous discovery), Ken Norton (PRD craft), Ryan Singer (shaping) provide complementary expertise"
  - decision: "ProtoOS Logic Loop as decision framework"
    rationale: "4-step process (Problem → Scope → Success → Solution) ensures problem-first thinking"
  - decision: "Bilingual PT-BR/EN support"
    rationale: "User base includes Brazilian and international PMs"
  - decision: "ASCII/text wireframing focus"
    rationale: "LLM cannot generate images; text-based wireframes provide maximum compatibility"
  - decision: "5 core knowledge bases"
    rationale: "Covers all 7 hard skills from spec: PRD, PRP, wireframing, RICE, customer discovery"

open_questions:
  - "Should prompt include full templates or reference KBs?"
  - "How to balance prompt length with comprehensiveness?"
  - "Should circuit breakers be explicit in prompt or implied by DNA?"

constraints_for_next:
  - "Prompt must be < 4000 tokens for efficiency"
  - "Must include ProtoOS Logic Loop explicitly"
  - "Must define clear output formats for PRD, PRP, wireframes"
  - "Must include bilingual instruction"
  - "Must reference KB files for detailed templates"

validation_criteria:
  - "Prompt captures essence of all 4 mentor clones"
  - "ProtoOS Logic Loop is actionable from prompt"
  - "Output formats are clear and consistent"
  - "Circuit breakers prevent common anti-patterns"
  - "Token count < 4000"
