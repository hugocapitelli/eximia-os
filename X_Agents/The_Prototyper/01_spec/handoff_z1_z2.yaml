summary: |
  Created comprehensive technical specification for The_Prototyper (ProtoOS),
  an Executive-tier agent specialized in Product Management artifacts including
  PRDs, PRPs, wireframes, and feature prioritization. Agent has 7 hard skills
  with expert/advanced proficiency, 4 mentor clones suggested, and clear
  success criteria with 5 KPIs.

artifacts_produced:
  - path: "01_spec/spec_tecnica.json"
    type: "spec"
    status: "complete"

key_decisions:
  - decision: "Executive tier (Tier 2) classification"
    rationale: "Multiple competencies (7), medium complexity domain, 8K token budget appropriate"
  - decision: "Text-based wireframes only"
    rationale: "LLM cannot generate images; ASCII/Markdown diagrams provide adequate fidelity"
  - decision: "Bilingual support (PT-BR/EN)"
    rationale: "User base includes Brazilian and international PMs"
  - decision: "Four mentor clones selected"
    rationale: "Marty Cagan (discovery), Teresa Torres (continuous discovery), Ken Norton (PRD craft), Ryan Singer (scoping)"

open_questions:
  - "Should agent specialize in specific industries or remain generalist?"
  - "What level of technical detail should wireframes include?"
  - "Should RICE scoring be automatic or require user input for confidence?"

constraints_for_next:
  - "Must extract DNA from all 4 mentor clones"
  - "Knowledge base must cover: PRD templates, PRP structure, RICE framework, interview analysis, wireframing"
  - "Style guide must balance precision with accessibility"
  - "Bilingual capability required in style guide"

validation_criteria:
  - "DNA mental covers all 4 mentor philosophies"
  - "Knowledge base has minimum 5 KBs covering core competencies"
  - "Style guide defines clear voice for both technical and non-technical audiences"
