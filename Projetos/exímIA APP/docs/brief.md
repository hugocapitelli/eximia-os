# Project Brief: ExímIA APP

**Document Version:** 1.0

## Executive Summary

**ExímIA APP** is an all-in-one AI-powered platform for entrepreneurs that dissolves the fragmentation between disconnected productivity tools. Instead of operating as a human middleware between separate apps, entrepreneurs get a **central nervous system** where Strategy, Execution, Learning, and Brand flow as a living organism.

**Primary Problem:** Entrepreneurs are trapped as "human middleware" between fragmented tools — using ChatGPT here, Notion there, spreadsheets elsewhere — with nothing connecting them.

**Target Market:** Entrepreneurs who are tired of being the integration layer between their tools and understand that scaling requires systems, not more work hours.

**Key Value Proposition:** The only platform where creating a strategic initiative automatically generates goals, suggests relevant courses, and applies brand voice to generated documents — all without the user lifting a finger.

---

## Problem Statement

### Current State & Pain Points

Entrepreneurs face the **"glass ceiling" of automation**:

| Symptom | Real Pain |
|---------|-----------|
| **Fragmented Processes** | Point AI usage without core connection. ChatGPT here, Notion there, spreadsheets elsewhere — nothing talks. |
| **Human Dependency** | Operations stop if no one pushes the button. Every integration requires a human in the middle. |
| **Lack of Standards** | Quality varies depending on who operates. Without processes, every execution is an adventure. |

The result? **Islands of Efficiency** — small isolated wins that never scale, never connect, never compose into something greater.

### Impact

- **Time wasted:** Hours daily switching contexts between tools
- **Lost insights:** Information silos prevent cross-domain connections
- **Scaling impossible:** The entrepreneur remains the bottleneck
- **Inconsistent quality:** No standardization across workflows

### Why Existing Solutions Fall Short

| Solution | Limitation |
|----------|------------|
| Notion/Obsidian | Great for notes, no AI integration, no cross-module intelligence |
| ChatGPT/Claude | Point solutions, no persistent context, no workflow automation |
| Zapier/Make | Connects apps but doesn't understand business context |
| Monday/Asana | Project management only, no learning, no brand, no strategy |

### Urgency

The AI wave is creating winners who integrate AI into their operating systems and losers who use it as a point tool. There's a narrow window to establish ExímIA OS as THE platform for the AI-native entrepreneur.

---

## Proposed Solution

### Core Concept

ExímIA APP is composed of **5 interconnected workspaces**:

| Workspace | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Journey** | Daily execution: goals, habits, reading, calendar |
| **Academy** | Deep learning with Socratic AI (strategic revenue pillar) |
| **Brand** | Identity and brand voice management |
| **PrototypOS** | Design and product prototyping |
| **Strategy** | Strategic planning that cascades to everything |

All connected through the **Connection Layer** — the invisible glue that makes everything talk.

### Key Differentiator: Connection Layer

> *"The value isn't in the features — it's in the CONNECTION between them."* — Elon Musk Clone Review

The Connection Layer represents **60% of the product value**. It transforms 5 isolated apps into a central nervous system through:

1. **Event Bus** — Every action generates an event; events propagate
2. **Entity Links** — Bidirectional connections between modules
3. **Suggestion Engine** — Proactive AI that anticipates needs
4. **Cascading Rules** — Intelligent automations
5. **Universal Inbox** — Quick capture of everything
6. **Proactive Notifications** — System that speaks to you

**Example Flow:**
```
Strategy: Create initiative "Launch MVP"
    ↓ [automatic cascade]
Journey: Goal "Launch MVP" created automatically
    ↓ [AI suggestion]
Academy: "We found a Product Management course"
    ↓ [bidirectional link]
Brand: Voice tone applied to PRD generated in PrototypOS
```

### Why This Solution Will Succeed

1. **Unique positioning:** No competitor offers true cross-module AI intelligence
2. **Clear moat:** Connection Layer architecture is defensible
3. **Revenue path:** Academy as Freemium with B2B expansion (Harven.AI)
4. **Built by entrepreneurs for entrepreneurs:** We live the problem daily

## MVP Scope

### Core Features (Must Have)

- **Connection Layer (Event Bus + Entity Links):** The foundation that makes everything work. Without this, we're just 5 isolated apps.

- **Journey Module (Goals + Habits):** The daily execution layer. Users can create goals, track habits, and see their progress.

- **Academy Module (Socratic Sessions MVP):** Core differentiator and revenue pillar. Basic course catalog with AI-driven Socratic dialogue.

- **Design System (Tokens + Core Components):** Consistent UI/UX across all modules. Amber brand color, light/dark themes.

- **Authentication (Supabase):** User registration, login, session management.

- **Suggestion Engine (v1):** Basic AI suggestions when events occur (e.g., goal created → suggest courses).

- **Universal Inbox:** Quick capture from anywhere, AI-assisted triage to appropriate modules.

### Out of Scope for MVP

- Strategy Module (full planning features)
- Brand Module (brand voice management)
- PrototypOS Module (PRD generation)
- Course_Designer (X_Agent integration)
- Finance Module
- Mobile app (React Native)
- B2B features (team management, white-label)
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Public API
- Third-party integrations (Zapier, etc.)

### MVP Success Criteria

The MVP is successful when:
1. A user can create an initiative in Strategy → Goal auto-created in Journey
2. User creates a goal → Academy suggests relevant courses
3. User completes a course → Skill reflected in their profile
4. User captures idea in Inbox → AI triages to correct module
5. 100 users actively using 2+ modules with 30%+ 7-day retention

## Technical Considerations

### Platform Requirements

- **Target Platforms:** Web (desktop-first, mobile-responsive)
- **Browser Support:** Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (last 2 versions)
- **Performance Requirements:**
  - Initial load: < 3s
  - Event processing: < 100ms
  - AI responses: < 2s

### Technology Preferences

- **Frontend:** Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **Backend:** Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Realtime) + Edge Functions
- **AI Service:** Python FastAPI (agent-service) for LLM orchestration
- **Database:** Supabase PostgreSQL with Row-Level Security (RLS)
- **Cache/Events:** Redis (for Event Bus message queue)
- **Hosting:** Vercel (frontend) + Supabase (backend) + Railway (agent-service)

### Architecture Considerations

- **Repository Structure:** Monorepo with `/app` (frontend), `/agent-service` (Python), `/supabase` (migrations)
- **Service Architecture:**
  - Next.js frontend calls Supabase directly for CRUD
  - Agent-service handles LLM calls and complex AI logic
  - Event Bus uses Supabase Realtime + Redis for high-throughput
- **Integration Requirements:**
  - Supabase Auth (OAuth providers)
  - OpenAI/Anthropic APIs (via agent-service)
  - Future: Moodle/SCORM export for Academy
- **Security/Compliance:**
  - Row-Level Security on all tables
  - JWT-based authentication
  - No PII in logs
  - LGPD compliant (Brazil)

---

## Constraints & Assumptions

### Constraints

- **Budget:** Bootstrap/self-funded initially. ~$500/month infrastructure budget.
- **Timeline:** MVP must be demonstrable within 8 weeks.
- **Resources:** 1 developer (with AI assistance). No dedicated designer.
- **Technical:** Must use existing Supabase project. Design system already specified.

### Key Assumptions

- Users will accept a desktop-first experience (mobile PWA later)
- The Connection Layer provides enough differentiation to justify switching costs
- Academy's Socratic AI is compelling enough to drive paid conversions
- Entrepreneurs are willing to consolidate tools if the value is clear
- AI suggestion quality will be high enough (>30% acceptance) to feel magical

---

## Risks & Open Questions

### Key Risks

- **Technical Complexity Risk:** Connection Layer architecture is ambitious. Event Bus + Suggestion Engine may be harder to implement than estimated.
  - *Mitigation:* Start with simple cascades (Strategy→Journey), add sophistication iteratively.

- **AI Quality Risk:** Socratic AI may not feel "intelligent" enough with current models.
  - *Mitigation:* Heavy prompt engineering, fallback to curated questions, iterate with user feedback.

- **Adoption Risk:** Users may not understand the cross-module value proposition.
  - *Mitigation:* Onboarding flow that demonstrates the "magic moment" (cascade + suggestion).

- **Competition Risk:** Major players (Notion, etc.) could add similar features.
  - *Mitigation:* Move fast, build moat in Connection Layer intelligence.

### Open Questions

- How do we handle users who only want 1-2 modules? (Pricing, feature gating?)
- What's the right balance between proactive suggestions and annoying the user?
- Should Academy courses be user-generated or curated only in MVP?
- How do we measure "insight quality" in Socratic sessions?
- What's the offline story for mobile PWA?

### Areas Needing Further Research

- Competitor analysis: How do Notion AI, Motion, Mem, and others handle cross-feature intelligence?
- User research: Interviews with 10+ entrepreneurs on tool fragmentation pain
- Technical spike: Benchmark Event Bus performance with Redis vs Supabase Realtime only
- Pricing research: What are entrepreneurs willing to pay for Academy Pro?
